**Purpose**: Bring you up to speed on the discovery process so we can complete Section 4 together

---

## Welcome, Kristyn

Rick and I have been working through a comprehensive discovery session to build Venturer Technology's 10-year business plan. We've completed Sections 1-3 (current business foundation, service offerings, and challenges) and started Section 4 (vision and aspirations).

Rick paused before completing Section 4 because these vision questions are ones you should answer together. This summary will catch you up on everything we've covered so far.

## The Big Picture: Where Venturer Technology Stands Today

### The Portfolio Reality

The discovery revealed you're operating a **three-entity portfolio**:

1. **Venturer Technology** (~$500k revenue)
   - Premium MSP brand serving NFP/charity and financial services
   - Currently 30% recurring revenue (~$150k ARR)
   - This is the focus of the 10-year plan

2. **Core Computers** (~$500k revenue)
   - Trading name under Venturer Technology legal entity
   - Community retail/repair serving micro business and home users
   - Dean manages day-to-day operations
   - Important part of your social mission

3. **Fortified Data and Security**
   - Separate legal entity, 50% partnership with Jack Degraff
   - "Slowly building but takes my time" (Rick's words)
   - Strategic role to be determined

**Total combined revenue**: ~$1M annually
**Current profit margin**: 15%
**Team**: ~6.8 FTE shared across all entities

### The Transformation Goals (for Venturer Technology)

**Revenue Mix**:
- Current: 30% recurring → Target: 80% recurring
- Need to grow from ~$150k ARR to ~$400k ARR (~$250k new ARR)

**Pricing**:
- Current: $45/seat → Target: $150/seat
- The $105/seat increase will be justified by adding vCIO service (more on this below)

**Profit Margins**:
- Current: 15% → Target: 25-50%

**Critical Constraint**:
- Must achieve this WITHOUT increasing staff count
- This means automation, systems, and exiting low-value work

---

## Section 1 Highlights: Current Business Foundation

### What Makes You Special

**Your Strongest Assets**:
1. **Very low customer churn** - customers only leave when you fire them or they close
2. **Strong referral-based growth** - Rick's business networking creates reliable pipeline
3. **Values-driven hiring mission** (veterans, people with disabilities) is well-regarded in the community
4. **Dual-brand strategy** allows you to serve premium MSP market (Venturer) AND community retail (Core) without confusing positioning

**Your Verticals**:
- **Venturer Technology**: NFP/charity and financial services (5-50 seats sweet spot, some up to 300 seats)
- **Core Computers**: Micro business and home users (community focus)

### Your Team

- **You and Rick**: Owners
- **Dean Hawley** (Navy veteran): Core Computers GM + manages onsites for both brands
- **Ethan Folwey** (part-time): Repair tech, working on engineering degree
- **Sam**: Help desk manager - ticket logging and escalations (new role)
- **Maddy**: New employee - phones, admin learning from you, Level 1 helpdesk, social media
- **Robin & Peter** (offshore, India): Website development, sales and marketing

**Your role** (from discovery): Accounts, payroll, hardware procurement, Level 1-2 helpdesk support, **AND** operational documentation for service delivery

---

## Section 2 Highlights: Service Offerings & Positioning

### Current Services

**Front of House (Core Computers)**:
- Computer repairs, printer/projector repairs, hardware sales, custom builds
- Warranty work for Brother/Epson (low margin but good lead source)

**Back of House (Venturer Technology MSP)**:
- Managed IT support, help desk, cybersecurity, cloud services
- Backup/disaster recovery
- My IT Process security standards auditing (TruMethods framework)

### How Customers See You

Rick's sales strength: "Ability to talk to business owner and explain IT support and security in a way they understand and break them into easy steps"

Customers describe you as: "their IT" and their "Cyber Security" provider - already positioning as IT department, not just repair service.

### Market Position

**Competitors**:
- One-man shops compete at low end
- Larger MSPs try to win business but don't build relationships like Venturer does
- **Critical finding**: Competitors charge "well above" your current $45/seat pricing

**Your pricing is TOO LOW** - Rick has very high close rate, meaning you're leaving money on the table. If you're closing most deals at $45/seat, you can likely close at higher prices too.

---

## Section 3 Highlights: Current Challenges & Pain Points

### The Top 3 Business Challenges

**1. Staff and HR Issues**
- Skills gap from values-driven hiring (hiring for potential vs. experience)
- Australian labor law makes performance management challenging
- Some staff have learned it's hard to be fired, creating accountability issues
- But this is solvable through systems and documentation (you've already proven this works for service delivery!)

**2. Quote Templates and Contracts**
- Currently using Quosy but it's clunky
- Rick wants standardized quote template with core services pre-defined
- Only needs to edit: seat count, onboarding fee, startup compliance projects
- **This is Rick's biggest sales bottleneck** - time spent creating quotes limits deal velocity

**3. Customer Onboarding Process**
- Have a small checklist but it's not complete
- Things getting missed: email security (DMARC/DKIM), DNS access requirements
- Need IT Glue documentation → Autotask task automation
- **Without standardized onboarding, you can't scale recurring revenue growth**

### Your Hidden Strength: Service Delivery Documentation

**Here's what impressed me most**: When asked about challenges in delivering consistent service quality, Rick said **"THIS IS A SECTION THEY DO WELL"**.

You've spent significant time **documenting the most common tasks that keep customers happy**. Combined with Rick's heavy investment in proactive monitoring tools, this is why you have:
- Very low churn
- Strong referral-based growth
- Consistent service quality even with less-experienced staff

**This is RARE and VALUABLE.** Most MSPs lack both documentation and proactive monitoring. You've built the foundation that makes values-driven hiring work.

**The key insight**: You've proven that documentation + systems allow values-driven hiring to succeed for service delivery. Now you need to extend the same approach to sales (quote templates) and onboarding (customer onboarding checklists).

### The Real Operational Challenge

It's **not the tools** - you have enterprise-grade stack:
- IT Glue (documentation)
- Autotask (PSA/ticketing)
- Quosy (quote manager)
- Kaseya Compliance Manager (security standards)

The gap is **using them correctly with templates and workflows**. Once templates are built, the SAME staff can handle MORE throughput with BETTER consistency.

**Biggest capacity constraint**: Not enough staff to run onboarding while maintaining help desk. This pulls Rick into too many directions and things get missed.

### What Keeps Rick Up at Night

HR concerns in Australian labor law environment, but also the broader challenge of building accountability culture when termination is difficult. EOS framework becomes EVEN MORE important in this context (Accountability Chart, Scorecard, Rocks, Level 10 Meetings).

### Sales and Marketing Gaps

**Sales Process**:
- Rick has very high close rate from warm referrals (excellent consultative selling)
- But the PROCESS needs systematization: formal sales stages, CRM tracking, pipeline management
- Problem isn't Rick's selling skill - it's the system around it

**Marketing**:
- Most business comes from referrals (passive lead generation)
- Have purchased **TMT (TruMethods Technology)** platform - Kaseya's integrated website/marketing/CRM for MSPs
- Currently **in setup phase** (not actively running yet)
- This should be Q1 2026 Rock: "Activate TMT platform with website, email campaigns, and CRM workflows"
- Robin/Peter are ideal to manage TMT day-to-day (leverage offshore team for marketing execution)

**AI Integration**:
- Rick recognizes AI is transforming the MSP industry
- Understands need for both knowledge AND implementation
- AI can address capacity constraint and position Venturer as forward-thinking MSP
- Applications: Quote automation, help desk chatbot, documentation assistance, marketing content, customer services

---

## The Game-Changer: vCIO Service

**This is THE strategic differentiator that unlocks everything.**

### What is vCIO?

**vCIO (virtual Chief Information Officer)** = Rick said "THIS WILL BE A LARGE PART OF THE BUSINESS PLAN"

Vision: Technical account managers constantly meeting with clients for strategic planning.

**What vCIO typically includes**:
- Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)
- IT roadmap planning and technology strategy
- Budget forecasting and financial planning
- Compliance and security planning (critical for financial services)
- Vendor management and contract optimization
- Technology alignment with business goals

### Why vCIO Changes Everything

**1. Justifies $150/seat pricing**:
- Current $45/seat = reactive break/fix support (vendor positioning)
- Target $150/seat = proactive managed services + quarterly vCIO (trusted advisor positioning)
- The $105/seat increase is justified by strategic advisory value

**2. Critical pricing decision made**:
- **vCIO will be BUNDLED in $150/seat price** (not separate premium tier)
- Creates "all-inclusive" positioning vs. competitors who charge separately for vCIO
- Every customer at $150/seat gets quarterly QBRs

**3. Perfect fit for your verticals**:
- NFP/charity and financial services need strategic IT planning
- Compliance and security planning critical for financial services
- Small one-man shops can't deliver vCIO - creates competitive moat

**4. Rick's future role**:
- Owner delivers vCIO initially (high-value, relationship-building work)
- Eventually document process and delegate to trained staff
- This is how Rick exits help desk work and moves to strategic role

### vCIO Delivery at Scale

At target ~267 seats ($400k ARR ÷ $150):
- If average customer is 20 seats = ~13 customers
- 13 customers × 4 QBRs/year = 52 QBRs annually = ~1 per week
- This is manageable for Rick initially
- As customer base grows, train staff to deliver vCIO under Rick's supervision

## Rick's Role Transition Vision

### What Rick Does Today

From the discovery: "Director, senior technical support, sales"
- Sales and closing deals
- Senior technical support
- Answering calls and help desk escalations
- Gets pulled into operations when staff are overwhelmed

**This is working IN the business, not ON it.**

### What Rick Wants to Do

**Desired role**: "Be the business owner and vCIO while training upcoming staff"

**Want to eliminate**: "Completely get off answering the calls and support desk"

This is the classic entrepreneur role transition - from tactical delivery to strategic leadership.

### The Transition Timeline

**Year 1 (2026)**: 80% tech / 20% vCIO
- Document Rick's technical knowledge (brain dump to IT Glue)
- Build help desk escalation playbooks
- Strengthen Sam's help desk management
- Begin delivering vCIO to pilot customers

**Year 2 (2027)**: 50% tech / 50% vCIO
- Reduce help desk involvement by half
- Scale vCIO service to more customers
- Document vCIO delivery process
- Build staff training programs

**Year 3-4 (2028-2029)**: 20% tech / 80% vCIO + training
- Help desk time down to 10% (escalations only)
- vCIO service scaled to majority of customers
- Senior staff trained for complex technical issues
- Rick focuses on vCIO, sales, strategic planning, staff development

**Year 5+ (2030-2035)**: 0% tech / 100% strategic (Visionary role)
- Completely off help desk
- vCIO for strategic accounts only (delegate standard accounts)
- Business owner, business development, training
- EOS Visionary seat

**This requires**: Developing Sam and other staff to take over Rick's current technical role through documentation, systems, and training.

## The Mission: More Than Just Business

### Values-Driven Hiring

**Core company identity**: Hiring veterans, people with disabilities, those needing career change/new life.

This creates growth constraints (skill levels, performance management in Australian labor law context), but it's also:
- A differentiator that's well-regarded in the community
- Particularly powerful for NFP/charity clients who share similar values
- A cornerstone of brand story and social mission

**The systems you've built prove this can work**: Your service delivery documentation allows less-experienced staff to deliver consistently. This validates the strategy: hire for values and cultural fit, train with documented systems.

### Core Computers Community Mission

Dean runs Core Computers day-to-day, including:
- Retail presence for elderly people who come in for advice and help
- "To be a big part of the local community"
- Low margin/high effort but supports brand reputation and creates referrals

Retail coverage is currently "whoever is in the office" (identified as a problem - creates interruptions), but the community service model is genuine and aligned with values.

---

## Section 4: Rick's 10-Year Vision (Q36 - What You've Answered Together)

**This is where it gets beautiful, and this is why I wanted you both to finish Section 4 together.**

### The Vision for 2035

**Three offices**:
1. **Brisbane** (current - primary operations base)
2. **Townsville** (deeply personal - your hometown, where most of your family lives, where you met Rick, where Rick served most of his army career)
3. **Staff-led location** (empowerment model - staff member helps build office in area where THEY have roots and family)

**Revenue**: $5-10M with 80% from MRR

**Core Computers role**: Will continue to make up to 40% of revenue - the community service model is replicable to other locations

### The Foundation

**Rick's vision**: "I would like a foundation attached to the company that continues to employ and train Veterans, People with a disability and those escaping a domestic issue and a change of life would help break the cycle."

This formalizes what's already core to who you are.

**Timing decision**: "Leave the foundation structure for a review next year. I want to focus on the core business model to start implementing the systems."

This is the RIGHT sequencing - build operational excellence and profitability FIRST, then formalize foundation when business can sustainably support it.

### Townsville Office - Already in Motion

**This isn't 10-year planning - it's active NOW:**

Rick: "Townsville office I have already made the pledge to start the process and is actively looking for a company to buy. I would prefer to have a small company in Townsville with the backend services in Brisbane."

**Acquisition search is active** - could happen 2026-2027, not 2035.

**Model**: Hub-and-spoke (small Townsville presence + centralized Brisbane backend)

**Why this matters**: Maintaining connection to HOME, not just business expansion. Multi-generational family connections.

### The Staff-Led Location

Rick's words: "Staff led location is an idea that will allow a staff member that we may not even have yet have the opportunity to move to an area they have roots to and grow. Maybe somewhere they want their children to grow up in or have children and grandkids in the area."

**This is about creating life opportunities for staff** - helping them build their future where they have roots, just like Townsville is for you.

### Rick's Role in 10 Years

**"GM (General Manager)"**:
- Traveling between offices mentoring management teams
- Focus on NFP and charity customers (mission-aligned)
- 5-7 week holiday blocks annually
- Remote work capability
- Properties in Brisbane, Townsville, and Melbourne (if your son stays there)
- **Primary priority: "I want to be involved in my grandchildren's lives if we are fortunate to have any"**

**This reveals the beautiful truth**: Business success ENABLES family connection. The multi-location business SERVES family geography. Extended holiday blocks mean the business can run without Rick present (systems and people in place).

**Grandchildren involvement = the ultimate "why" for building all of this.**

---

## Major Strategic Insights (The "Aha" Moments)

### 1. This is About Legacy and Impact, Not Just Profit

The 10-year vision isn't about building a $10M MSP to sell. It's about:
- Creating meaningful employment for veterans, people with disabilities, domestic violence survivors
- Staying connected to family across multiple locations
- Building something that allows you both to be present grandparents
- Helping staff members build their own futures where they have roots
- Serving NFP/charity customers aligned with your values

**Profit enables the social mission** - you need strong margins and systems to sustainably support the hiring mission and foundation.

### 2. The Transformation is Actually Achievable

**The corrected math** (now that we know Venturer = $500k, not $1M):
- Current Venturer ARR: ~$150k (30% of $500k)
- Target Venturer ARR: ~$400k (80% of $500k)
- Need: ~$250k new ARR

This is MORE achievable than the original $500k ARR growth target, BUT Rick's time is divided across three entities (Venturer + Core + Fortified). Focus becomes critical.

### 3. vCIO is the Centerpiece

Everything connects to vCIO service:
- Justifies $150/seat pricing
- Positions Venturer as trusted advisor not vendor
- Perfect fit for NFP/financial services verticals
- Creates competitive moat
- Becomes Rick's strategic role as he exits help desk
- Enables the entire transformation

### 4. Service Delivery is Your Secret Weapon

**Your documentation work** is the foundation that makes everything possible:
- Allows values-driven hiring to work (less-experienced staff can deliver consistently)
- Explains low churn and strong referrals
- Creates competitive advantage (most MSPs lack this)
- Proves that systems + documentation work

**The path forward**: Extend this same proven approach to sales (quote templates) and onboarding (customer onboarding checklists).

### 5. Portfolio Focus is the Critical Strategic Question

Three entities compete for attention during Venturer's critical transformation:
- **Venturer Technology**: Transformation focus (premium MSP)
- **Core Computers**: Strategic asset for community mission (40% of future revenue)
- **Fortified Data and Security**: "Slowly building but takes my time" - strategic role unclear

**Measurement gap**: Not currently tracking Venturer vs. Core revenue/profitability separately. Classic EOS principle: Can't manage what you don't measure.

**Staff shared across both brands** creates capacity constraints and context-switching.

**Strategic question for Section 4 discussions**: What role does each entity play in the 10-year vision? Should Fortified be scaled, maintained, or exited to focus on core transformation?

### 6. You Need Measurement Before Optimization

Rick's honest answer: "Do NOT measure anything at the moment"

**This is normal and appropriate** for a business at $1M milestone. You achieved $1M through hustle and execution. NOW is the time for systematic measurement.

**Immediate Rock (Q1 2026)**: "Implement EOS Scorecard with TruMethods measurables"

TruMethods quarterly meetings provide the framework. You need baseline metrics before you can track transformation progress.

### 7. The Right Tools, Wrong Implementation

You have enterprise-grade tools (IT Glue, Autotask, Quosy, Kaseya Compliance Manager, TMT) but haven't completed templates and workflows.

**This is NOT a tool problem or headcount problem** - it's a **systems design** problem.

**The opportunity**: Configuration, template development, and workflow automation within existing tools. Once built, SAME staff can handle MORE throughput with BETTER consistency.

**High-priority Rock**: "Build operational templates and workflows in existing tech stack" - addresses quotes, onboarding, and capacity constraints.

### 8. Sales + Marketing + AI are Interconnected

These aren't separate challenges - they're integrated capacity multipliers:
- AI improves sales process (quote automation, CRM optimization)
- AI enables marketing (content generation, campaign optimization)
- Marketing + sales creates systematic growth engine
- Robin/Peter can use AI to produce more marketing content faster
- TMT platform (in setup) provides the infrastructure

## Where We Are Now: Ready for Section 4 Together

**Q36 (10-year vision) is complete** - Rick's answered where he sees the business in 2035.

**Now we need YOUR input on the remaining Section 4 questions** (Q37-Q44):

**Questions waiting for you and Rick to answer together**:
- Q37: **3-year vision** - Where should Venturer be in 2028?
- Q38: What does success look like personally for both of you?
- Q39: What are you willing to sacrifice or change?
- Q40: What must NOT change (non-negotiables)?
- Q41: How do you want to be known in the market?
- Q42: What role in business ownership energizes vs. drains you?
- Q43: Do you want to sell business eventually, pass it on, or scale indefinitely?
- Q44: If money weren't an issue, what would you do differently?

These questions require BOTH of your perspectives because:
- You and Rick have different roles and strengths
- Personal vision (family, lifestyle, grandchildren) requires both voices
- Business decisions affect both of your daily lives
- Your operational insight is critical (you've built the service delivery documentation)
- The 10-year vision touches on deeply personal things (Townsville family connections, work/life integration, legacy)

---

## Critical Context for Your Input

### Your Strategic Importance

Throughout the discovery, a picture emerged of your **critical strategic role**:

**Operations**:
- You've built the service delivery documentation that enables consistent quality
- You handle accounts, payroll, procurement (the business operations backbone)
- You do Level 1-2 helpdesk support
- You train new staff (Maddy learning from you)

**Systems Thinking**:
- The documentation you've created proves you're the "systems thinker" in the partnership
- You build repeatable processes that allow values-driven hiring to work
- You should likely lead or heavily contribute to quote template and onboarding checklist development

**This matters for Section 4** because:
- Rick can articulate WHAT he wants (vCIO service, $150/seat, exit help desk)
- You understand HOW to make it happen (documentation, systems, processes)
- The 3-year vision needs both perspectives

### The Townsville Decision

The Townsville office is deeply personal for you:
- Your hometown
- Where most of your family lives
- Multi-generational family connections
- Where you and Rick met

**Rick has already committed to active acquisition search.** Your input on:
- Timeline and readiness (when should this happen?)
- How to maintain Brisbane operations while building Townsville
- Family considerations and priorities
- Backend services model (what stays in Brisbane vs. Townsville)

### Work/Life Integration

Rick's 10-year vision includes:
- 5-7 week holiday blocks
- Properties in Brisbane, Townsville, Melbourne
- Being involved grandparents
- Rick traveling between offices while working remotely

**Your perspective matters**:
- What does YOUR ideal role look like in 10 years?
- What work/life balance do you want?
- How do you see the business enabling family connection?

### The Foundation

Rick wants to formalize the foundation (veterans, people with disabilities, domestic violence survivors) but deferred structure to 2026 review.

**Your voice is critical**:
- What role do you want in the foundation?
- What does sustainable support look like?
- How does this integrate with business operations?

---

## What Happens After Section 4

Once Section 4 is complete, we'll move to:

**Section 5: Strategic Priorities**
- What needs to happen in Year 1, 3, 5, and 10?
- What are the biggest obstacles and how to overcome them?
- What capabilities/resources are needed?

**Section 6: EOS Foundation**
- Core values definition
- Core Focus (purpose, cause, passion)
- Accountability Chart (who sits in what seats)
- Initial Rocks for Q1 2026

Then we'll use all of this to build:
- **Vision/Traction Organizer (V/TO)** - EOS's foundational planning tool
- **Quarterly Rocks** - 90-day priorities for 2026
- **Scorecard** - Key metrics to track weekly
- **Strategic roadmap** - Multi-year transformation plan

---

## Final Thoughts

Kristyn, what Rick has shared reveals a business built on genuine values and a vision that's about so much more than profit. The social mission isn't marketing - it's who you are. The multi-location strategy isn't empire-building - it's about staying connected to family and creating opportunities for staff.

**Your documentation work** has built the foundation that proves values-driven hiring can work at scale. The service delivery systems you've created explain the low churn and strong referrals.

**The transformation is achievable** because you already have:
- The right tools (IT Glue, Autotask, Kaseya, TMT)
- The right approach (documentation + systems)
- The right values (hiring mission + customer relationships)
- The right market position (verticals, differentiation, referral engine)

**What's needed**: Extend your proven systems approach from service delivery to sales and onboarding. Build the templates and workflows. Implement measurement. Let Rick transition from help desk to vCIO. Scale what's already working.

The 10-year vision Rick described - three offices, formalized foundation, being present grandparents, empowering staff to build their futures - that's beautiful and worth building toward.

**Now it's time for your voice** on the 3-year vision, what success looks like personally, and what must not change as you transform the business.

---

## Ready to Continue?

**Next Question (Q37)**: Where do you see Venturer Technology in 3 years (2028)?

This is the bridge between today and the 10-year vision. What should be accomplished by 2028 to be on track for the 2035 vision?

Both of your perspectives will create a more complete and realistic picture.

I'm excited to hear your vision.

— Claude (your MSP growth advisor, working with Rick to build Venturer Technology's strategic plan)
