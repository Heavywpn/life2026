5. Update status if changed (Not Started → In Progress → At Risk → Complete)
6. Save the updated file

**When user says "document L10 meeting" or "log L10 meeting":**
1. Read current `meetings/l10-meeting-notes.md`
2. Ask for meeting date and key information

## How to Resume This Project

**Current Status**: Discovery session 93% complete (53 of 57 questions answered). Paused at Q54 for team collaborative session.

**If the user says "continue" or "let's continue":**
1. Read `discovery-session.md` to see current progress
2. Look for "PAUSED HERE" marker at Q54
3. Check if user wants to:
   - Complete Q54-Q57 now (requires team input from Rick, Kristyn, Dean)
   - Review/revise existing deliverables (V/TO, 1-Page Overview, Team Agenda)
   - Generate additional strategic documents
   - Begin implementation planning

**Next Phase**: Team collaborative session (late Nov/early Dec 2025) to complete Q54-Q57:
- Set Q1 2026 Quarterly Rocks
- Build initial Issues List
- Define weekly Scorecard metrics
- Establish L10 Meeting Pulse

**Implementation Timeline**:

## Working with This Repository

When updating discovery-session.md:
1. Maintain the markdown structure and formatting
2. Update the Executive Summary when major insights emerge
3. Mark questions requiring follow-up as "Status: NEEDS FOLLOW-UP"
4. Add strategic notes when tensions or opportunities are identified
5. Update the status line at top of file to reflect progress
6. When pausing, add "RESUME HERE" marker at stopping point

When the discovery phase is complete, the next phase will involve developing strategic frameworks and action plans based on the gathered information using the msp-growth-advisor agent.
