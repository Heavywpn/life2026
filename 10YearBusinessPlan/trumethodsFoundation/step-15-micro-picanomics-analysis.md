# TruMethods Step 15: Micro Picanomics - Implementation Roadmap

## DOCUMENT OVERVIEW

**Title:** Step 15 Guide - Micro Picanomics
**Core Methodology:** Per-seat cost analysis framework for achieving 70% gross margins on managed services
**Key Insight:** Every $1.00 of seat cost requires $3.33 of seat price to achieve a 70% gross margin - understanding true per-seat costs across all delivery areas is essential for profitable pricing
**Impact on Venturer Technology:** Critical for transformation from $45/seat to $150/seat pricing while improving margins from 15% to 25-50%

## 10-YEAR PLAN INTEGRATION

### Current Plan Alignment:
- ✓ Pricing transformation goal ($45→$150) directly supported by Micro Picanomics framework
- ✓ Margin improvement targets (15%→50%) achievable with 70% gross margin methodology
- ✓ Focus on recurring revenue aligns with seat-based pricing model
- ✓ Small team constraint addressed through efficiency metrics
- ✓ EOS framework compatible with SMART numbers approach

### Identified Gaps:
- ⚠️ Current discovery session lacks detailed cost-per-seat analysis
- ⚠️ V/TO missing specific delivery area role definitions
- ⚠️ No current tracking of seats per support resource metric
- ⚠️ Tools cost optimization not explicitly addressed in plan
- ⚠️ Support efficiency targets need definition

### Potential Conflicts:
- ⚠️ Current hybrid retail/MSP model dilutes focus on seat optimization
- ⚠️ $45/seat pricing is below sustainable levels per framework
- ⚠️ 15% margins indicate significant cost structure issues
- ⚠️ Lack of role separation may be hiding true delivery costs

### Recommended Plan Updates:
1. **Add to VTO-venturer-technology.md:** Define 5 delivery areas and target costs per seat
2. **Update strategic-overview-1-page.md:** Include Micro Picanomics metrics dashboard
3. **Create Q1 2026 Rock:** "Implement Micro Picanomics cost tracking system"
4. **Add L10 Scorecard Metrics:**
   - Average AISP (target: $150)
   - Cost per seat (target: $45)
   - Gross margin % (target: 70%)
   - Seats per support resource (target: 640)
5. **Adjust Timeline:** Accelerate pricing increases to capture margin improvements faster

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Critical Dependencies:
1. **Accurate time tracking** - Must know where every hour goes
2. **Clean client data** - Exact seat counts per client required
3. **Tool stack rationalization** - Eliminate redundant tools before calculating
4. **Buy-in from Dean** - Technical leader must champion efficiency metrics
5. **Client communication** - Prepare value justification for price increases

### Resource Requirements:
- **People:** 40-60 hours initial setup, 4 hours/week ongoing tracking
- **Budget:** $0 for framework, potential $500-1000 for dashboard tools
- **Tools:** PSA time tracking, spreadsheet for calculator, BI tool for dashboard
- **Training:** 8-hour team workshop on Micro Picanomics concepts

### Risk Factors:
- **Client pushback** on seat-based pricing if value not demonstrated
- **Incomplete data** leading to incorrect cost calculations
- **Role confusion** if team members wear multiple hats
- **Tool creep** adding new tools without retiring old ones
- **Support overwhelm** during efficiency improvement phase

### Quick Wins:
1. **Immediate pricing test:** Quote next prospect at $95/seat (2x current)
2. **Tools audit:** Likely find $500-1000/month in unused subscriptions
3. **Support triage:** Implement 15-minute first response SLA
4. **Client segmentation:** Identify top 20% for premium service pilot
5. **Gross margin visibility:** Simple spreadsheet delivers instant insight

### Team Capacity:
- **Rick:** 8-10 hours for initial analysis, 2 hours/week ongoing
- **Kristyn:** 4-6 hours for tools audit, 1 hour/week tracking
- **Dean:** 10-15 hours for support optimization, 3 hours/week execution
- **Team sessions:** 2-hour monthly review of Micro Picanomics metrics

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### The Three Simple Numbers to Track:
1. **Average AISP** - Current: $45 → Target: $150
2. **Average MRR** - Current: 30% → Target: 80%
3. **Seats per Support Resource** - Current: Unknown → Target: 640

### Gross Margin Formula:
**Average AISP ($150) - Average Cost per Seat ($45) = Gross Margin per Seat ($105) = 70%**

### Key Transformation Metrics:
- **Support Cost:** Reduce from $25-30 to under $10 per seat
- **Centralized Services:** Optimize from $20 to $15 per seat
- **Technology Alignment:** Establish at $11 per seat value delivery
- **vCIO Services:** Price at $6 per seat for strategic guidance
- **Total Cost Target:** $52 per seat or less

### Implementation Sequence:
1. Calculate current baseline
2. Identify biggest cost drivers
3. Implement quick wins
4. Redesign service delivery
5. Optimize each delivery area
6. Scale efficient model
7. Achieve target margins

## CONCLUSION

Micro Picanomics provides the exact framework Venturer Technology needs to transform from a low-margin hybrid business to a high-margin focused MSP. The methodology directly addresses the core challenge: moving from $45/seat to $150/seat while improving margins from 15% to 50%.

The framework's emphasis on understanding true per-seat costs across all delivery areas will reveal why current margins are only 15% and provide a clear path to 70% gross margins. By implementing this methodology, Venturer Technology can achieve its 3-year target of $3M revenue with 20-30% net margins, setting the foundation for the 10-year vision of becoming Queensland's most trusted MSP for charities.

**Next Step:** Schedule a 2-hour working session with Rick, Kristyn, and Dean to complete the Micro Picanomics calculator with actual Venturer Technology data and establish baseline metrics for Q1 2026 transformation.
