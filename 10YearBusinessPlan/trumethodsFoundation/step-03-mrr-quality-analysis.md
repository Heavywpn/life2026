# TruMethods Step 3: Not All MRR Is Good MRR - Implementation Roadmap

## DOCUMENT OVERVIEW

**Title:** Step 3 Guide - Not All MRR Is Good MRR
**Core Methodology:** MRR Quality Evaluation and Client Prioritization Framework
**Key Insight:** Not all monthly recurring revenue contributes equally to profitability - identifying and focusing on "sweet spot" clients ($3,000-$7,000/month) while eliminating high-noise, low-margin accounts is essential for sustainable growth.
**Impact on Venturer Technology:** Critical for achieving the $45→$150/seat pricing transformation and 30%→80% MRR target by systematically evaluating client profitability and strategically pruning the customer base.

## 10-YEAR PLAN INTEGRATION

### Current Plan Alignment:
- ✓ Focus on recurring revenue transformation (30%→80%)
- ✓ Pricing evolution strategy ($45→$150/seat)
- ✓ Charity and financial sector specialization
- ✓ Values-driven hiring practices
- ✓ EOS implementation framework

### Identified Gaps:
- ⚠️ No current MRR quality evaluation process in discovery-session.md
- ⚠️ Missing client segmentation strategy in strategic documents
- ⚠️ Lack of specific client transition timeline in V/TO
- ⚠️ No defined "sweet spot" client criteria in target market
- ⚠️ Reactive vs proactive metrics not tracked in current Scorecard

### Potential Conflicts:
- ⚠️ Short-term revenue impact from client pruning vs growth targets
- ⚠️ Team capacity during client transitions with only 3 people
- ⚠️ Balance between social mission hiring and skill requirements

### Recommended Plan Updates:

1. **Add to VTO-venturer-technology.md:**
   - Sweet spot client definition: $3,000-$7,000 MRR, 30-80 seats
   - MRR quality as quarterly Rock theme
   - Client optimization as Year 1 priority

2. **Include in strategic-overview-1-page.md:**
   - MRR vs ORR target ratios (80/20)
   - Client segmentation categories
   - Reactive noise reduction goals

3. **New Q1 2026 Rocks for rocks/ folder:**
   - "Complete MRR Evaluator for all clients" (Rick)
   - "Transition 3 unprofitable clients" (Team)
   - "Implement $95+ minimum pricing" (Kristyn)

4. **Scorecard metrics for L10 meetings:**
   - Average MRR per client
   - MRR as % of total revenue
   - Reactive hours per client
   - Client noise index (tickets/seats ratio)
   - Average seat price across client base

5. **Timeline adjustment:**
   - Month 1-2: Analysis and planning
   - Month 3-6: Client transitions
   - Month 7-12: Sweet spot acquisition
   - Year 2-3: Full transformation

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Critical Dependencies:
1. **Accurate financial data** - Must have clear visibility into true client costs before making decisions
2. **Team alignment** - All three team members must understand and support client transitions
3. **Communication planning** - Professional transition approach for exiting clients
4. **Service standardization** - Must deliver consistent value to remaining clients
5. **Sales discipline** - Resist taking on bad MRR during transition period

### Resource Requirements:
- **Time:** 200-250 hours over first year for full implementation
- **Tools:** MRR Evaluator spreadsheet, CRM for tracking, financial reporting system
- **Training:** TruMethods methodology for team (estimated $2,000-3,000)
- **Technology:** Automation tools to reduce reactive noise ($500-1,000/month)
- **External support:** Possible consultant for difficult client transitions ($5,000 budget)

### Risk Factors:
- **Cash flow impact** during client transitions (maintain 3-month reserve)
- **Team morale** when letting go of long-term clients
- **Market perception** if transitions aren't handled professionally
- **Opportunity cost** of turning away non-ideal revenue
- **Execution complexity** with current team size

### Quick Wins:
1. **Identify and document** the single most problematic client (Week 1)
2. **Raise prices** for one small client as a test case (Week 2)
3. **Create MRR dashboard** for weekly visibility (Week 3)
4. **Define sweet spot** criteria with team consensus (Week 4)
5. **Celebrate first** successful client transition (Month 2)

### Team Capacity:
- Rick: 15-20 hours/month on client evaluation and transitions
- Kristyn: 10-15 hours/month on financial analysis and pricing
- Dean: 5-10 hours/month on service standardization
- Consider this 40-hour monthly commitment when planning other initiatives

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

The TruMethods MRR Quality framework provides Venturer Technology with a systematic approach to transform from a reactive, low-margin MSP to a proactive, highly profitable managed services provider. By focusing on sweet spot clients ($3,000-$7,000 MRR), eliminating high-noise accounts, and standardizing service delivery, the company can achieve its ambitious targets while maintaining work-life balance and social mission.

The most critical insight: **Fewer, better clients generate more profit with less stress.** This counterintuitive approach - shrinking to grow - will enable Venturer Technology to build the sustainable, valuable business that provides financial freedom for Rick and Kristyn while serving something bigger than themselves.

Success requires courage to say no to bad revenue, discipline to maintain standards, and commitment to the long-term vision even when short-term pressures mount. The MRR Evaluator becomes a quarterly ritual, ensuring continuous optimization of the client base toward the ideal mix that supports all stakeholder goals.
