# TruMethods Step 12: The Outside Sales Process - Implementation Roadmap

## DOCUMENT OVERVIEW

**Title:** Step 12 Guide - The Outside Sales Process (TruMethods Framework Foundations)

**Core Methodology:** Pain-Money-Decision framework with Reframing & Sales Separation to create compelling reasons for prospects to choose your MSP services over competitors

**Key Insight:** 80% of the sale should be complete before presenting - focus on understanding end-result pain (business impact) not technical pain, and create clear separation through your unique Technology Success process

**Impact on Venturer Technology:** This methodology directly addresses your need to increase pricing from $45/seat to $150/seat by shifting conversations from technical support costs to business value and outcomes - critical for your charity and financial verticals

## 10-YEAR PLAN INTEGRATION

### Current Plan Alignment:
- ✓ Directly supports pricing transformation from $45 to $150/seat
- ✓ Aligns with values-based selling to charity and financial verticals
- ✓ Builds on referral-based growth model already working
- ✓ Supports Rick's transition from technician to CEO/strategist
- ✓ Creates scalable, teachable process for future hires

### Identified Gaps:
- ⚠️ Current V/TO doesn't explicitly mention sales process transformation
- ⚠️ No specific Rocks identified for sales methodology implementation
- ⚠️ Marketing message needs updating to reflect value-based approach
- ⚠️ CRM and sales tracking tools not specified in current plans
- ⚠️ Sales compensation structure not defined for future hires

### Potential Conflicts:
- ⚠️ Time investment in sales training may conflict with technical delivery in short term
- ⚠️ Higher pricing may initially reduce close rate, impacting Q1-Q2 2026 revenue
- ⚠️ Team capacity constraints during methodology transition period
- ⚠️ Need for upfront investment in sales tools and training

### Recommended Plan Updates:
1. Add Q1 2026 Rock: "Implement TruMethods sales methodology"
2. Update V/TO 3-Year Picture to include "Industry-leading sales process"
3. Add weekly pipeline review to L10 Scorecard metrics
4. Budget $10K for sales training and tools in 2026
5. Define sales hire profile and compensation structure by Q2 2026
6. Create sales playbook as Process documentation priority
7. Add "Sales effectiveness" as quarterly Rock theme
8. Include CRM implementation in technology roadmap

## CONCLUSION

The TruMethods Outside Sales Process provides a clear roadmap for Venturer Technology's pricing transformation. By focusing on business pain rather than technical issues, creating clear separation through your Technology Success framework, and controlling the sales process with disciplined methodology, you can justify and achieve the 3x pricing increase needed for your 10-year vision.

The key is starting immediately with pain discovery and value articulation while building toward a scalable sales organization. This isn't just about charging more - it's about fundamentally repositioning Venturer Technology as a strategic business partner rather than a technical service provider.

Success requires committed execution, patience during the learning curve, and faith that delivering superior value justifies premium pricing. The charity and financial verticals you serve need and deserve this level of strategic technology partnership.
