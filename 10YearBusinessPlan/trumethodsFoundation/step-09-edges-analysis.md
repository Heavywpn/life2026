# TruMethods Step 9: Defining Your Edges - Implementation Roadmap

## DOCUMENT OVERVIEW

**Title:** Step 09 Guide - Defining Your Edges (TruMethods Framework Foundations)
**Core Methodology:** Service boundary definition framework for MSP service delivery areas
**Key Insight:** Clear service edges eliminate client confusion, prevent scope creep, and enable premium pricing by establishing transparent boundaries between included and billable services.

## 10-YEAR PLAN INTEGRATION

### Current Plan Alignment:
✓ Directly supports pricing transformation from $45 to $150/seat
✓ Aligns with Core Value "Fiercely Protect Our Clients" through transparency
✓ Enables operational efficiency for margin improvement (15% → 25-50%)
✓ Supports referral-based growth through clear value proposition
✓ Compatible with 3-person team starting point

### Identified Gaps:
⚠️ Current discovery session lacks specific service edge definitions
⚠️ V/TO needs explicit mention of service clarity as differentiator
⚠️ No current Rock addressing immediate edge definition needs
⚠️ Scorecard missing service scope creep metrics
⚠️ Team session agenda should include edge definition exercise

### Potential Conflicts:
⚠️ Time investment needed while maintaining current operations
⚠️ Risk of losing some clients who benefited from fuzzy edges
⚠️ Initial revenue dip possible as billable work becomes clear

### Recommended Plan Updates:
1. Add to VTO-venturer-technology.md: "Service Edge Clarity" as key differentiator
2. Include in strategic-overview-1-page.md: Service transparency as Year 1 priority
3. Create Q1 2026 Rock: "Define and Document All Service Edges"
4. Add Scorecard metric: "% of tickets within defined service edges"
5. Include in team-session-agenda.md: 30-minute edge definition workshop

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Critical Dependencies:
1. **Sequence:** Must define edges BEFORE raising prices
2. **Communication:** Client education must precede enforcement
3. **Team alignment:** All staff must understand edges before client rollout
4. **Documentation:** Legal review required for service agreements
5. **Systems:** Ticket system must support edge categorization

### Resource Requirements:
- **People:** 200 hours Rick, 100 hours Dean, 80 hours Kristyn in Year 1
- **Budget:** $5,000 legal review, $2,000 documentation design
- **Tools:** Service desk software upgrade may be needed ($200/month)
- **Training:** Team training on edge enforcement (20 hours)
- **Marketing:** Client communication materials ($1,500)

### Risk Factors:
1. **Client pushback:** Some clients accustomed to "all-inclusive" may resist
2. **Revenue impact:** Short-term revenue may dip before recovering
3. **Team capacity:** Defining edges while serving clients is challenging
4. **Competitor response:** Others may offer "unlimited" to undercut
5. **Complexity creep:** Risk of over-engineering edge definitions

### Quick Wins:
1. **MAC policy:** Immediate revenue impact by billing for moves/adds/changes
2. **Support hours:** Define business hours vs. after-hours support
3. **Third-party apps:** Clear policy on what's supported vs. best-effort
4. **Project vs. support:** Distinguish included support from billable projects
5. **Device limits:** Set clear boundaries on device types and quantities

### Team Capacity:
- Current 3-person constraint requires phased approach
- Rick leads strategy and client communication
- Dean implements technical boundaries
- Kristyn manages client education and feedback
- New Q1 2026 hire can help enforce edges
