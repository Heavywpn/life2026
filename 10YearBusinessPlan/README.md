3. **1-Year Plan (Nov 2026)**: $1.5M revenue (50% growth), $130-150/seat pricing achieved, first hire Q1 2026, full EOS implementation by March 2026, Profit First methodology deployed

4. **Core Values**: Fiercely Protect Our Clients, Grow Together, Serve Something Bigger (community and sacrifice mindset)

5. **Core Focus**: Premium managed services with bundled vCIO for charities, NFPs, and financial services (5-300 seats) in Queensland

6. **Critical Transformation**: Pricing from $45/seat → $130-150/seat, recurring revenue 30% → 80%, margins 15% → 25-50%
