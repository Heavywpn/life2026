## 10-YEAR PLAN INTEGRATION

### Current Plan Alignment
✓ Strong values foundation already established

### Identified Gaps
⚠️ **Pricing methodology**: Need immediate focus on AISP optimization
⚠️ **Service packaging**: Four Blocks model not yet implemented
⚠️ **Client conversion plan**: No systematic approach documented
⚠️ **Operational playbook**: "Your Company Way" needs documentation
⚠️ **Minimum MRR policy**: Not established, risking profitability

### Potential Conflicts
⚠️ **Timeline aggression**: May need to slow hiring if conversions lag
⚠️ **Pricing resistance**: Some clients may not convert, requiring difficult decisions
⚠️ **Resource constraints**: 3-person team bandwidth for transformation
⚠️ **Market education**: Charity sector may need extensive value communication

### Recommended Plan Updates

1. **Add to V/TO Page 1**:
   - Marketing Strategy: "Four Blocks positioning"
   - Proven Process: "TruMethods service delivery"
   - 3-Year Picture: Include "Average AISP: $150+"

2. **Add to Strategic Overview**:
   - Immediate priority: "Package and price transformation"
   - Q1 2026 focus: "Convert 10 clients to new model"
