**Energy Level:** 7/10

---

### Evening Reflection

**Did I accomplish my priorities?**
- [1]: ✓ - Telos folder structure created with comprehensive templates
- [2]: Partial - Structure is ready, need to fill out with my personal content
- [3]: ✓ - Review schedule established in telos.md

**Wins today:**
- Successfully created a comprehensive personal Telos system
- Learned about the Telos framework and its philosophy
- Have clear structure for life tracking going forward

**Struggles today:**
- None major - smooth setup process

**Insights/Learning:**
- The Telos framework's emphasis on traceability (Problems → Mission → Goals → Projects) is powerful
- Having a structured system for life tracking could really help with clarity and focus
- The "streaming activity log" concept makes sense - this should be continuously updated, not static

**Next Steps:**
- Fill out the foundation files (problems, mission, values, narratives)
- Set first goals based on mission
- Begin daily journaling practice
- Schedule first weekly review

**Mood:** [To be filled in morning]

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**
[Morning ritual not completed - will add tomorrow]

**Intention for the day:**
[Morning ritual not completed - will add tomorrow]

---

### Evening Reflection

**Overall Day Rating:** 6/10

**Wins Today:**
- Great presentation to Infinity Community Solutions on Qustodio for protecting foster care kids from online threats (P1 + P3 mission work directly)
- Good conversation with Dean (Navy vet, Core Computers manager) about handling staff issues calmly - his approach: advertise now, give Maddy few weeks to prove herself
- Kristyn had successful PT session (talking about being 47, body changes with trainer)
- Kristyn happy after KBN (Key Business Networking) meeting - building friendships with business owners who understand what running a business is like
- Cooking dinner together with Kristyn while Rotary Zoom meeting (bruschetta with garden tomatoes, ribeyes, garden pumpkin, asparagus)
- Stayed sober despite strong wine craving

**Struggles Today:**
- Maddy called in for mental health day after lots of sick time - frustration with reliability (partner of veteran, DV father, housing commission background - fits P1 mission but unreliability threatens business scalability)
- Sam wanting to change Friday work-from-home arrangement after just one day
- Strong wine craving today (forgot wallet - got lucky)
- Missed ice bath/gym/sauna because chose to stay staffed at office instead of "selfish time" after Infinity presentation - work until 6pm, Rotary at 6:30
- Andrew's performance coaching session still feels like no substance

**Fitness & Body:**
- ❌ No ice bath today (Q1 Day 2, first miss - 8 misses left to hit Rock #4 90% target of 81+ days)
- ❌ No gym/workout
- ❌ No red light sauna
- **Why:** Work until 6pm, Rotary at 6:30, chose not to leave Kristyn and Dean understaffed after Infinity presentation
- **Pattern noticed:** Ice bath skip → wine craving stronger (correlation is real)

**Diet:**
- **Breakfast:** [Not tracked - will add to morning ritual going forward]
- **Lunch:** [Not tracked]
- **Snacks:** [Not tracked - will add to evening ritual going forward]
- **Coffee:** [Not tracked - will add to evening ritual going forward]
- **Dinner:** Bruschetta (Kristyn made - garden tomatoes, onion, basil, Turkish bread), ribeye steaks, roasted garden pumpkin, asparagus
- **Drinks:** Large glass of milk with dinner
- ✅ **No alcohol** (despite strong wine craving earlier)

**Family Moments:**
- **Kristyn:** Cooking dinner together while Rotary meeting on Zoom (most other members retired, we're still working/cooking). She came to office happy after KBN meeting - building her own network outside of just "Ricky's wife" or "Venturer admin"
- **Parker:** No contact today
- **Ronin:** No contact today

**Insights/Thoughts:**
- Dean's Navy approach (advertise now, give Maddy few weeks) is calmer/smarter than going direct immediately - takes emotion out of it
- Ice bath skip → wine craving correlation is real - missing it made craving stronger
- Tension between "selfish time" for gym vs staying staffed is directly threatening Rock #4 (90%+ ice bath consistency)
- **Key tension:** If unreliable staff force me to skip health routines, they're threatening the foundation that enables everything else
- Maddy fits P1 mission (partner of veteran, DV father, housing commission background) but if she can't show up reliably, she threatens the business that funds the mission
- **Brutal question:** Is giving her chance after chance actually helping her, or enabling the same lack of accountability that kept her stuck?

**Tomorrow's Priority:**
- Sit down with Maddy if she shows up - clear expectations, recognition of good work, career plan vision, honest about advertising
- Protect ice bath time (Dean's framing: "If you don't go to the gym, you're not available to the business anyway because you'll be managing wine cravings instead of leading. That's not selfish, that's operational readiness.")

---

## Week 1 (Nov 4-10) - Continued

### Tuesday, November 5, 2025 - Evening Reflection (Continued)

**I LOVE MY WIFE**

**Overall Day Rating:** 7/10

**Wins Today:**
- ✅ **Ice bath DONE** - 9 minutes including 30 seconds full immersion after heavy back workout + 20 min sauna (Q1 Day 2: 1/2 days completed, 8 misses remaining)
- **Smart Maddy decision** - Advertising position (Dean's advice), will talk to her Friday with Dean present to calm conversation. Maddy was shy today, probably thought she was in trouble - gave her space
- **Problem-solving win with Sam** - Sam made a bad mistake but it became a good puzzle to work out how to fix remotely, saved 10 hours of driving tomorrow
- **Heavy back workout** - Got the training in
- **Slight wine craving only** - Pattern holding: ice bath done = easier evening control

**Struggles Today:**
- **Missed very important TruMethods meeting** - ANGRY AT MYSELF because I was doing too many small things for staff that they should have been able to do themselves
- This is the "choosing to stay staffed" pattern costing me strategic work
- Dean's right: "Not selfish, operational readiness" - this missed meeting is proof

**Fitness & Body:**
- ✅ **Ice bath:** 9 minutes + 30 seconds full immersion at 4°C
- ✅ **Workout:** Heavy back workout
- ✅ **Sauna:** 20 minutes red light
- **Pain level:** [Standard - leg, ribs, arm]
- **Tinnitus:** [24/7 as always]

**Diet:**
- **Breakfast:** [Need to add to morning ritual tracking tomorrow]
- **Lunch:** Salmon sushi and sashimi
- **Snacks/Coffee:** A few too many cookies this afternoon - need to watch this in late afternoon
- **Dinner:** Fresh cooked lamb shoulder, Kristyn made fresh tzatziki, had it on small tortillas (very yummy), small ice cream bite
- ✅ **Alcohol:** None - slight wine craving only

**Family Moments:**
- **I LOVE MY WIFE** - Kristyn's period making her emotional and forgetful, but we are happy. She cooked amazing dinner (lamb shoulder, homemade tzatziki)
- **Ronin:** Good phone talk today - he's doing well at QUT
- **Parker:** No contact today - will try to call him tomorrow

**Insights/Thoughts:**
- **The missed TruMethods meeting anger** - This is the consequence of not protecting strategic time. Staff small tasks cost me important quarterly planning work
- **Maddy Friday conversation** - Dean will attend to keep it calm. Concern: energy drinks → sleep problems → "mental health days". If she commits to reliability, she stays. We're advertising regardless
- **Ice bath = wine craving control** - Pattern now confirmed over 2 days: do ice bath = slight craving, skip ice bath = strong craving

**Tomorrow's Priority (Wednesday):**
- Morning ritual FIRST - set top 3 priorities before anything else
- Continue work priorities
- Protect ice bath time tonight

---

### Thursday, November 6, 2025

**Energy Level:** 7-8/10
**Mood:** Happy, feeling good - no hangover

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Whoop Score:** 76% overall
  - Hours needed: 76%
  - Sleep consistency: 81%
  - Sleep efficiency: 95%
  - Sleep stress: 17% (high - from eating late dinner)
- **Woke:** 0430 (sunrise wake - Army habit since East Timor)
- **Quality:** Good despite late dinner

**Breakfast:**
- Action Network Breakfast at Coffee Commune (bacon & eggs - always a good day pattern)

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**
1. **Action Network Breakfast** - networking, leads, referrals → G1 (hiring mission-aligned staff), G2 (MRR growth)
2. **Office 365 migration: GoDaddy → Microsoft tenant** - client delivery priority → G2 (MRR), P3 (protecting businesses from cyber threats)
3. **Eye test 6pm + Gym (sauna + ice bath)** - glasses old, affecting reading/concentration. Gym at same complex, go straight up after → Rock #4 (ice bath 1/3 days, CANNOT miss today - only 8 misses left)

**Intention for the day:**
**"Be happy, consistent, and a good husband to Kristyn."**

Drinking slowing during the week → no hangover → Kristyn happy → good relationship. Do the tasks required with consistency. Show up as the husband she deserves.

**Notes:**
- Maddy conversation moved to Friday priority (no time today with Action Network + O365 migration + eye test)
- Eye test critical - old glasses affecting concentration/reading
- Smart stacking: Eye test → gym → sauna → ice bath all same complex

---

### Evening Reflection

**Overall Day Rating:** 8/10

**How priorities went:**
1. ✅ **Action Network Breakfast** - Great catchup, good connections. BUT: Realization that only a few people actually organize everything while others just expect things to happen and complain if it's not what they want. Thinking of leaving the group in the new year. Violates P2 (integrity) when effort is so imbalanced.
2. ⚠️ **Office 365 migration** - Client cancelled the project
3. ✅ **Eye test + Gym** - FULLY COMPLETED
   - Eye test at 6:30pm: Close vision stayed same, far vision starting to deteriorate (theory: wearing glasses too much)
   - Straight to gym, met Kristyn
   - 20 min sauna together
   - 10 min ice bath ✅ (Rock #4: 2/3 days now, back on track!)
   - Home to cook dinner together

**Wins Today:**
- ✅ **Ice bath: 10 minutes** - Rock #4 back on track (2/3 days, 1 miss used, 8 misses remaining)
- **Helped Craig** - Friend who had stroke recently, dropped him at medical appointment on way back from office. Good to talk to him, see he's recovering. Pure P1 mission work.
- Great Action Network catchup (connections made)
- Eye test handled (vision assessed)
- Full evening with Kristyn: sauna 20min + ice bath 10min + cooking dinner from garden
- **BNI chapter lunch tomorrow** - Excited! VP role, get to shape culture. Brand new chapter so I set the standard, not the cult-like BS typical BNI has
- ✅ **No alcohol: 4/4 days** (ice bath pattern holding)

**Struggles Today:**
- **Maddy: Another mental health day** - Really needed her today but she didn't come in. Decision made: reduce hours right down, re-advertise position. Dean and I will talk to her together. She does fantastic work when she's there but unreliability is hurting the team. I feel like I'm protecting the mission, not failing it - if she burns out Dean or causes client failures, can't help anyone.
- Office 365 migration cancelled (client side)
- Action Network realization: few organizing, many complaining - considering leaving

**Fitness & Body:**
- ✅ **Ice bath:** 10 minutes at 4°C
- ✅ **Sauna:** 20 minutes with Kristyn
- ✅ **Eye test:** Close vision same, far vision deteriorating
- **Pain level:** Standard (leg, ribs, arm)
- **Tinnitus:** 24/7 as always

**Diet:**
- **Breakfast:** Action Network breakfast - bacon & eggs (always a good day pattern)
- **Lunch:** Pie (the "naughty" choice)
- **Afternoon:** Fresh juice (Kristyn makes every morning, we drink in afternoon - daily routine together)
- **Dinner:**
  - Kristyn: Bruschetta entrée with fresh tomatoes from our garden
  - Me: Steaks with roast pumpkin from our garden + steamed broccolini
  - Working together, eating food we grew ourselves
- **Before bed:** Glass of milk
- ✅ **Alcohol:** None

**Family Moments:**
- **Kristyn:**
  - Told her today "I've been looking at you for over 26 years now"
  - She told me she loves me before falling asleep tonight
  - Sauna together, ice bath together, cooking dinner together
  - I love her more and more each day
  - Garden vegetables we grew together
- **Parker & Ronin:**
  - Thought about them a lot today, hoping they're having great days
  - Tell most people I meet how proud I am of my boys
  - They're young men (22 & 20) building their own families now - Parker with Liam fostering his brother, Ronin in AI/Robotics masters
  - My role has shifted: watching and enjoying the stories of their week
  - I try to talk to them once a week - not hovering, not absent, just present
  - They're living good lives, making their own choices - Kristyn and I raised men who can stand on their own

**Insights/Thoughts:**
- **Ice bath → great feeling → no drinking → quality time with Kristyn** - Pattern confirmed again (Day 3)
- **BNI vs Action Network contrast:**
  - BNI: I'm VP, shaping culture of brand new chapter, excited about lunch tomorrow
  - Action Network: Few organize, many complain, thinking of leaving
  - **Insight:** Energized by groups where I can lead and shape culture, drained by groups where effort is imbalanced
- **BNI organization = cult-like (don't like), but MY chapter = brand new, I set the standard**
  - Same pattern as Venturer/IT industry: take flawed system, prove it can work differently with integrity
  - I AM the culture right now in this brand new chapter - can shape it before cult stuff takes root
  - Mission work: Take BNI structure (works for referrals) + strip cult BS + set culture based on integrity/service/real relationships
- **Maddy decision = protecting mission, not failing it:**
  - Want her to stay (fantastic work, fits P1), but unreliability hurts team/clients
  - If she burns out Dean or causes client failures, can't help anyone
  - Mission requires functioning business
  - Integrity (P2) = being honest about what's working vs what isn't
  - Dean + me talking to her together: calm Navy approach + direct honesty
- **Craig's appointment today:** Friend recovering from stroke, I helped get him to medical appointment - pure P1 mission work (helping people who've been failed/broken by systems)
- **Garden food:** Growing vegetables with Kristyn, cooking together, eating what we grew - grounding, partnership, building with our hands

**Tomorrow's Priority (Friday):**
- BNI chapter lunch (VP role, excited!)
- Maddy conversation with Dean (expectations, reduced hours, re-advertising)
- Protect ice bath time (3/4 days - keep the streak alive)

---

### Friday, November 7, 2025

**Energy Level:** 9/10
**Mood:** Strong, clear-headed, enjoying quiet morning coffee

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Whoop Score:** 85% performance
  - Hours needed: 71% (note: need to try sleeping in tomorrow morning)
  - Sleep consistency: 89%
  - Sleep efficiency: 97%
  - Sleep stress: 0% ✅
- **Woke:** 0440 (sunrise wake - Army habit since East Timor)
- **Quality:** Excellent - zero stress

**Morning Context:**
- Black coffee at 0440, very enjoyable
- Kristyn asleep next to me in bed
- Quiet, clear-headed start to Day 4

**Breakfast Plan:**
- Skipping breakfast entirely (intermittent fasting approach)
- BNI lunch = first meal of the day
- **Intentional choice:** Order eggs at BNI (not burger) - maintaining "bacon & eggs = always a good day" pattern
- Avoiding the automatic office breakfast burger habit

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**
1. **BNI chapter lunch (VP role)** → Rock #1 (hiring), Rock #2 (MRR), P2 (integrity in business). Brand new chapter = I set the culture standard, not the cult-like BS typical BNI has. Excited!
2. **Maddy conversation with Dean** → Rock #1 (hiring mission-aligned staff), protecting mission by maintaining functioning business. Calm Navy approach + direct honesty about expectations, reduced hours, re-advertising.
3. **Protect ice bath time tonight** → Rock #4 (ice bath 90%+ days). Currently 2/3 days (66.7%), 1 miss used, 8 misses remaining. Cannot miss today - pattern proven: ice bath = easier evening control, better mood, better husband.

**Intention for the day:**
"Be the leader who sets the standard - in BNI culture, in honest conversations with staff, and in protecting the routines that make me the husband Kristyn deserves."

**Notes:**
- BNI excitement: Brand new chapter, I'm VP, I shape the culture before cult stuff takes root
- Same pattern as Venturer/IT industry: take flawed system, prove it can work differently with integrity
- Maddy conversation: Not failing mission, protecting it - can't help anyone if business fails or team burns out
- Ice bath: 3 days proven pattern - do it = great feeling, no drinking, quality time with Kristyn

---

  - Good morning, enjoyed it
  - Energized the group to keep building together
  - Brand new chapter, I'm setting the culture standard
  - Mission alignment: Rock #1 (hiring), Rock #2 (MRR), P2 (integrity in business)

- **Priority 2: Maddy conversation with Dean** ✗ DID NOT HAPPEN
  - Maddy was off sick again
  - Will need to reschedule when she returns

- **Priority 3: Protect ice bath time tonight** ✅ COMPLETED
  - Ice bath streak: 3/4 days (75%)
  - Rock #4: 3/4 days completed, 7 misses remaining (out of 9 allowed)
  - Pattern holding strong

**Fitness & Body:**
- ✅ **Ice bath:** Done (Rock #4: 3/4 days, 75%, 7 misses remaining)
- ✅ **Workout:** Shoulder workout - going heavier
- ✅ **Sauna:** Magnesium pools on roof with Kristyn
- **Pain level:** Standard (leg, ribs, arm)
- **Tinnitus:** 24/7 as always

**Wins today:**
- BNI was a good morning, enjoyed it, energized the group to keep building together
- Ice bath streak: 3/4 days ✅
- **Massive alcohol transformation:** Old Friday vs new Friday
  - Old pattern: Would have been drinking by now, half bottle gone
  - New pattern: Large glass of milk, no desire for more alcohol
  - This is what I'm working towards - pattern holding
- Shoulder workout going heavier
- Cooking with Kristyn using her garden ingredients
- **Gym cost insight:** Very expensive gym for me and Kristyn BUT reduction in alcohol purchases offsets the cost completely

**Struggles/Frustrations:**
- **Maddy conversation didn't happen** - She was off sick again
  - Still need to have the conversation with Dean present
  - Pattern of unreliability continuing

- **Food cascade is a habit that can be fixed with routine:**
  - Grazes throughout day because hungry from all workouts
  - BNI breakfast was all carbs, bad fats - ruined eating plan
  - Shared sushi with Kristyn (not enough protein)
  - Need more structured meal prep

- **Hardest part: Some clients need too much attention**
  - Leaving things too late
  - Expecting instant response
  - This is the most frustrating part of the work

**Thoughts & Ideas:**

**1. Ice bath evolution:**
- Coming from competition background (Army, athletics)
- Naturally pushing himself in ice bath
- 10 minutes is current comfortable time
- Starting to explore: "How long can I go?"

**2. Friday transformation (OLD vs NEW):**
- **OLD FRIDAY:** Would have been drinking by now, half bottle wine gone
- **NEW FRIDAY:** Large glass of milk, no desire for more alcohol
- This is exactly what I'm working towards - pattern holding strong

**3. Gym cost offset:**
- Very expensive gym for both me and Kristyn
- BUT: Reduction in alcohol purchases completely offsets the gym membership cost
- Investment in health vs spending on drinking - clear financial trade-off

**4. Preparation matters:**
- **Key insight:** "I am a soldier and can adapt to any situation with preparation and training"
- Food cascade problem = lack of preparation/routine
- Can be fixed with better meal prep structure

**5. Kristyn gym insight:**
- She's starting to enjoy gym more
- **Discovery:** They're better working out apart then meeting up for sauna
- **Why it works:** Kristyn is shy in public but when left alone to find her own groove, she excels
- Giving her space to discover her own rhythm = she's thriving

**6. Ricky gym insight:**
- Loves the social part of gym
- Loves meeting new people
- **Ego acknowledgment:** "As I'm so strong and built like a tank, people stop and watch me lift. It is ego but I like it at my age. People cannot believe I am almost 50."
- Different needs: Kristyn needs space, Ricky thrives on social energy

**Family Moments:**

**Kristyn:**
- **"I love my wife more than anything"**
- Gym together but working out apart, meeting for sauna - both finding their groove
- She's starting to enjoy gym more
- Shy in public but excels when left to find her own way
- Cooking together with her garden ingredients
- Magnesium pools together on roof after workouts
- **Supporting her Rotary presidency preparation:** She's becoming president next year
- **KBN networking:** Building her own business friendships with other business owners

**Parker:**
- No direct contact today
- Both boys doing their own things
- **Plan for tomorrow:** Kristyn and I will call Parker Saturday morning when he has time
- He works long hours over weekend to cover time off from full-time uni
- **Ricky's words:** "They are exceptional human beings and Kristyn and I are very proud"

**Ronin:**
- No direct contact today
- **Plan for weekend:** Will try to see Ronin this weekend
- He works long hours over weekend to cover time off from full-time uni at QUT (AI/Robotics masters)
- **Ricky's words:** "They are exceptional human beings and Kristyn and I are very proud"

**Energy Patterns:**
- **Started day:** 9/10 (excellent sleep, zero stress, clear-headed)
- **Ended day:** 8/10 (strong, feeling good, excellent Friday transformation)
- **What drained me:** Clients needing too much attention, leaving things too late
- **What energized me:** BNI lunch (leading culture), ice bath routine, cooking with Kristyn

**Diet Tracking:**
- **Breakfast at BNI:** All carbs, bad fats (launch breakfast) - ruined eating plan
  - **Note:** Should have stuck to eggs instead of eating what was provided
- **Grazing all day:** Hungry from workouts, no structured meals
- **Caffeine discipline:** ✅ No coffee/limited caffeine after 10:30 AM
- **Lunch:** Shared sushi with Kristyn (not enough protein for workout days)
- **At gym:** 1 gin & tonic, shared sweet potato wedges cooked in tallow
- **Dinner:** Nachos together - fresh beef mince, corn chips, Kristyn's garden ingredients (tomatoes, herbs)
- **Before bed:** Large glass of milk
- ✅ **Alcohol:** None beyond the 1 gin & tonic - no desire for more

**Tomorrow Preview:**
- Saturday morning: Call Parker when he has time
- Try to see Ronin this weekend
- Let body recover from week of workouts
- Enjoy weekend time with Kristyn

**Gratitude:**
I'm grateful for this Friday. The old me would be half a bottle into wine by now, probably heading for a full bottle, waking up Saturday with a hangover and wasted morning. Instead I'm clear-headed, had a great workout, did ice bath, cooked dinner with my wife, and I'm heading to bed feeling strong. This is what all the work is for - these Friday nights where I'm present, not drunk. The ice bath routine is working. The gym is working. The pattern is holding. And Kristyn is happier because I'm happier. This is the life I'm building.

### Saturday, November 8, 2025

**Energy Level:** 8/10
**Mood:** Excited, anticipatory - special celebration day ahead

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Woke:** [Not tracked - weekend sleep-in attempted]
- **Quality:** Good rest

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **Call Parker on the train** → Serves: Family connection (Parker & Ronin are part of life goals)
   - Timing: During train ride to Roma St station
   - Together with Kristyn

2. **Contact Ronin to see if working tomorrow** → Serves: Family connection
   - If Ronin working Sunday, travel to his restaurant for light lunch to see him
   - Shifts Ronin visit from today to Sunday

3. **Get sunglasses for yacht day** → Serves: Yacht day preparation
   - Must be done this morning before 11:45 AM bus departure
   - Ricky and Kristyn going together

**Intention for the day:**
**"To be fully present with my friends and Kristyn"**

Present (not distracted, not numb, not drunk). With friends (quality time with business owners I look forward to seeing). With Kristyn (quality partnership time on beautiful day). Swimming in ocean (active, enjoying nature).

**YACHT DAY CONTEXT - CELEBRATION MODE:**

**Logistics:**
- **Departure:** Must be ready to board bus at 11:45 AM
- **Return:** "I do not care about the return time" - celebration day, no fixed end
- **Destination:** Likely Peel Island (beautiful cove, great place to swim)

**Drinking Plan (Chosen Consciously):**
- **Mode:** "Celebration mode but not to excess"
- **Focus:** "I really want to spend most of the time swimming in the ocean"
- This is conscious choice - celebration with boundaries, activity-focused

**Why This Matters:**
- Reward for hard year
- Business owner friendships (pooled resources for luxury experience)
- "Don't be held back" mission value in action
- Sunny QLD, fresh seafood, beautiful cove
- Quality time with Kristyn on the water

**Rock #4 Decision (Ice Bath):**
- **Status:** Accepted miss #2 out of 9 allowed
- **Rationale:** Celebration day, late return, conscious trade-off
- **Remaining:** 7 misses left for 85 remaining days in quarter
- **Current standing:** 3/4 days (75%) after this miss becomes 3/5 days (60%)
- **Honest acknowledgment:** This is a conscious choice to celebrate, not a failure - still plenty of margin to hit 90%+ target

**Notes:**
- Sunglasses MUST happen before 11:45 AM
- Parker call during train ride (together with Kristyn)
- Ronin contact to plan Sunday visit if he's working
- Swimming will be the focus activity on yacht
- Celebration with boundaries - presence over excess

- Long weekend hours covering time off from full-time uni
- Thinking about him even when we don't connect

**Energy Patterns:**
- **Started day:** Low after Saturday (magical day but drinking → poor sleep)
- **Ended day:** Satisfied, energized from business plan completion
- **What drained me:** Recovery from Saturday activities and drinking
- **What energized me:** Completing 10-year business plan (huge mental achievement), time with Kristyn, good food, ice bath

**Tomorrow Preview:**
- Back to work week
- Business plan sent to Dean and Kristyn for review
- Continue daily practice (morning ritual, evening reflection)
- Protect ice bath routine (4/6 days, need to get back to 90%+ consistency)

**Gratitude:**
I'm grateful for Saturday's magic - dolphins, sailing, ocean swimming, friends, celebration. I'm grateful that Sunday was a recovery day with Kristyn, working together on the business plan. I'm grateful for getting the 10-year vision out of my head and onto paper - that's been sitting in there for months and now it exists. I'm grateful for phone time with Ronin. And I'm grateful that even after drinking Saturday, I got back to ice bath Sunday and didn't let the weekend become an excuse to fall off the routine. The pattern is holding - celebration is allowed, but recovery and routine continue.

## Monthly Insights

*Emerging patterns and learnings*

**Ice Bath Pattern (Days 2-3 confirmed):**
- Day 2: Missed ice bath → strong wine craving (forgot wallet, got lucky)
- Day 3: 10 min ice bath → felt great → no drinking → quality time with Kristyn cooking dinner
- **Pattern is real:** Ice bath = easier evening control, better mood, better husband

**Energy Sources vs Drains:**
- **Energized by:** Leading and shaping culture (BNI VP, brand new chapter), mission-aligned work (Craig's appointment), time with Kristyn (garden, cooking, sauna, ice bath)
- **Drained by:** Imbalanced effort (Action Network - few organize, many complain), unreliable staff forcing coverage

**Mission Tension - Maddy Situation:**
- Fits P1 perfectly (partner of veteran, DV background) but unreliability threatens business
- Decision: Protecting mission by maintaining functioning business, not failing mission
- Can't help anyone if business fails or team burns out
- Integrity (P2) = honesty about what's working vs enabling

**Garden Food Connection:**
- Growing vegetables with Kristyn → cooking together → eating what we grew
- Grounding, partnership, building with our hands
- Fresh juice daily (Kristyn makes morning, drink afternoon)
- Tomatoes, pumpkin from garden in meals

**Family Evolution:**
- Boys (22 & 20) building own lives - Parker fostering Liam's brother, Ronin in AI masters
- Role shifted: watching and enjoying their stories, not directing
- Weekly connection rhythm working - not hovering, not absent, present
- Kristyn: 26 years together, love growing stronger

## Week 2 (Nov 11-17)

### Tuesday, November 11, 2025 - Day 8 of Q1

**REMEMBRANCE DAY - Lest We Forget**

**Energy Level:** 9/10
**Mood:** Very good mood
**Woke:** 4:51am (body clock dialed in)

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Whoop Score:** 90% performance ✅
- Quality: Excellent

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **Remembrance Day - RSL badge selling (QLD government building)** → P1 (veteran welfare fundraising), duty, service above self
   - Selling badges to raise money for RSL and veteran welfare
   - Everyone is QLD government employees
   - Watching government workers - lots nice and genuine, rest are "pigs at a trough"
   - Some try to pay with state cards (I point it out, they switch to personal cards)
   - New government this year, may be different
   - **The reality:** Veterans volunteering to raise money because military/government don't care once you leave or get hurt

2. **KBN meeting (Key Business Network)** → Rock #1 (hiring connections), Rock #2 (MRR/business relationships)
   - Haven't been in a while
   - Sent substitutes who I think will get something out of it
   - Building mission-aligned network

3. **Protect ice bath time tonight - NON-NEGOTIABLE** → Rock #4 (missed last night Day 7, now 4/7 Week 2, only 6 misses left for quarter)
   - **CRITICAL:** Plan with Kristyn NOW - what time leaving together? What does she need to eat BEFORE we go?
   - Cannot miss again - margin too tight

**Intention for the day:**
**"Be the proof that veterans rebuild ourselves - the system won't do it."**

The military and government do not care once you leave or are hurt and cannot serve anymore. It is veterans volunteering to raise money and awareness. We rebuild our own lives because the system that broke us won't.

**Notes:**

**Maddy situation update:**
- Had conversation yesterday Monday Nov 10
- Reduced her hours
- She turned up way too early this morning and started working
- I pointed out: "This is not a job where you can turn up whenever you feel like it"
- This week will more than likely be her last week
- Decision made, executing, mental energy freed up

**Ice bath MISS last night (Monday Nov 10):**
- Week 2 status: 0/1 days so far (missed Monday night)
- Overall Q1: 4/7 days (57.1%), 3 misses used, 6 misses remaining
- **What happened:** Set aside time to leave early, waiting for Kristyn (goal is go together)
- Busy day, she was stressed, wouldn't express needs
- Asked twice about leaving, she said nothing until too late
- **Pattern noticed:** If she asks about food before leaving office = she's hungry
- **Choice made:** If I went to gym, she wouldn't eat until after 8pm. Chose feeding Kristyn over ice bath.
- **Real tension:** Only 6 misses left for quarter. Need to solve this communication pattern.
- **Tonight's plan:** Talk with Kristyn THIS MORNING about tonight - time, food plan, both go together

**Foundation priority removed:**
- Moved to 2 years out in 10-year business plan
- Not a Q1 Rock anymore

---

**Kristyn:**
- Joined Parker conversation once I got home
- Had dinner together (steak, pumpkin, asparagus)
- She's been understanding about busy week

**Ronin:**
- No contact today
- Will try to connect this week

**Thoughts & Ideas:**

**Tattersals moment = proof of pattern change:**
- Guys having lunch, drinking, social pressure to stay
- Old Ricky: Would have joined, stayed for long lunch, started drinking
- New Ricky: Said hello, didn't drink, didn't stay, went back to work
- **This is what the ice bath routine has built** - even on a miss day, the pattern held
- The discipline is becoming automatic

**Pattern confirmed: No fitness → bloated, skipped lunch → low energy:**
- Body is telling me what it needs
- Movement matters for how I feel
- Fuel matters for energy throughout day
- Can't ignore these signals without consequences

**Late clients vs protected routines:**
- Late client caused schedule collapse
- Missed workout and ice bath
- Only 5 misses remaining for quarter
- Need to protect the routines that make leadership possible
- Can't serve clients well if I'm not taking care of foundation

**Parker exam stress:**
- He's nervous about uni exams this week
- But I know he's a strong man
- Kristyn and I raised him to handle pressure
- Proud of how he approaches challenges

**Energy Patterns:**
- **Started day:** 5/10
- **Ended day:** Flat/low
- **What drained me:** Skipped lunch, no workout, late client stress, busy schedule
- **What energized me:** Tattersals alcohol control win, Remembrance Day success, KBN meeting, Parker call

**Tomorrow Preview:**
- Protect ice bath time - NON-NEGOTIABLE (only 5 misses left)
- Get workout in if possible
- Don't skip lunch
- Continue Maddy situation (last week likely)

**Gratitude:**

I'm grateful for the Tattersals moment. That was the old pattern staring me in the face - guys having lunch, drinking, social time - and I didn't take the bait. I said hello, stayed sober, went back to work. That's the ice bath routine working even on a day I miss it. That's proof the pattern is changing at a deep level.

I'm grateful for Remembrance Day - selling badges with other veterans, raising money because the system won't take care of us. We take care of each other. That's always been the way.

I'm grateful for Parker's voice on the phone. He's stressed about exams but he's strong. Kristyn and I know he'll handle it.

And I'm grateful that even though I missed the ice bath tonight, I chose reasonable bedtime over pushing too hard. Recovery matters. Tomorrow I get back to it.

### Wednesday, November 12, 2025 - Day 9 of Q1

**REMEMBRANCE DAY WEEK CONTINUES**

**Energy Level:** 7/10
**Mood:** Weird mood, mind already racing ahead
**Woke:** 4:15am (strategic early bedtime 8:30pm Tuesday paid off)

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Whoop Score:** 91% performance ✅ (excellent recovery)
- **Sleep:** ~7.75 hours (bed 8:30 PM, woke 4:15 AM)
- **Quality:** 9/10
- **HRV:** 55 (UP from 40 - significant improvement)
- **Resting heart rate:** 64 (DOWN - excellent)
- **Strategic choice validated:** Chose sleep over missed gym/ice bath Tuesday → body responded perfectly

**Morning Context:**
- Body clock excellent - 4:15am wake
- Strategic sleep decision Tuesday (annoyed from missing gym/ice bath, frustrated with Rotary) paid off massively
- **Pain:** 6/10
  - Foot feeling a little better
  - **Tinnitus is BAD this morning** - constant ringing, no peace
  - Leg and knee aching already
  - Management approach: "Will just ignore it as normal"

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **Ice bath tonight - NON-NEGOTIABLE** → Rock #4 (ice bath 90%+ consistency)
   - **Q1 Status:** 6/8 days (75%), only 7 misses remaining for quarter - AT RISK
   - Pattern proven: Ice bath → no drinking → good sleep → better HRV
   - Tuesday miss was strategic (chose sleep), but margin is too tight now
   - Cannot miss again

2. **Chase late customer quotes + address staffing gap** → Rock #1 (Hire mission-aligned staff), Rock #2 (MRR growth)
   - User frustration evident: "Too much of my time is taken with small things that my staff should be able to do"
   - Notice what tasks he's doing that staff should handle
   - Late quotes need following up
   - Maddy situation closing this week - hiring gap real

3. **Don't skip lunch - fuel for calm/reflective state** → Daily intention + energy management
   - Tuesday pattern: Skipped lunch → low energy spiral → flat mood by evening
   - Needs fuel to manage the day effectively
   - Body telling what it needs - listen

**Intention for the day:**
**"Today I choose calm and focus over reaction. I manage my time, my energy, and my response to challenges - including this tinnitus, this pain, and these staffing frustrations. I'm building something new (the system), not just fighting fires. The day doesn't run me."**

**Notes:**

**New system progress:**
- Excited about it
- NOT time-sensitive today
- Should be able to start using and testing soon
- Building something that will solve the "too much time on small things" frustration

**Background from Tuesday Nov 11:**
- Day: 6/10
- **🎉 HUGE WIN:** Tattersals Club - didn't drink with guys at lunch, went back to work (proof pattern changing)
- Remembrance Day: $40K+ raised for RSL, sold out badges
- Ice bath missed (chose sleep - strategic recovery decision)
- No workout - felt bloated
- Skipped lunch - low energy by evening
- Rotary meeting: "Joan talks too much, old ladies circle"
- Good Parker call (uni exams this week) + Kristyn dinner

**Potential obstacles:**
- **Tinnitus is BAD this morning:** Management plan = ignore as normal, don't let it dictate mood
- **Late clients:** Protect ice bath time tonight - cannot let client urgency override health foundation
- **Staffing frustration:** Notice tasks that shouldn't be his, gather data for hiring plan
- **Lunch skip temptation:** Set alarm if needed, non-negotiable fuel

**Confidence level:** 7/10 - Clear priorities, good recovery from Tuesday sleep, intention is strong

- Pattern holding: did ice bath → no drinking desire

**No alcohol:**
- ✅ Zero alcohol despite stressful day
- Ice bath routine working even on hard days
- Old pattern would be wine by now

**Learned important staff lesson:**
- Maddy's ticket mistake taught me to check work before it goes to customers
- Can't just trust and hope anymore
- This is part of management I've been avoiding

**Reconnected with Kristyn:**
- Morning argument about nothing
- She cooked dinner despite the tension
- That's 25+ years of partnership showing up
- Love language: feeding me even when we're not perfect

**Struggles/Frustrations:**

**Morning argument with Kristyn:**
- Fought about "nothing really"
- Started day tense and disconnected
- Carried that stress into work

**Maddy ticket mistake - major frustration:**

- Maddy unreliability + mistakes = can't delegate confidently
- Hiring gap painfully real now

**Diet:**
- **Breakfast:** [Not tracked - check Whoop or recall]
- **Lunch:** ❌ SKIPPED (second day in row)
- **Dinner:** Kristyn cooked for me (specific meal not captured - what did she make?)
- **Water:** [Not tracked but probably low]
- **Coffee:** [Not tracked]
- **Supplements:** [Not tracked]
- ✅ **Alcohol:** NONE (despite stressful day)

**Family Moments:**

- **Reconnection:** We're okay. The cooking was her way of saying "we're still us"
- This is what partnership looks like - showing up even on hard days

**Parker:**
- No contact today
- Still doing uni exams this week

**Ronin:**
- No contact today
- Need to connect this week

**Thoughts & Ideas:**

**Staff lesson from Maddy mistake:**
- Can't just trust and delegate blindly anymore
- Need to check work before it goes to customers
- This is the management work I've been avoiding
- Hiring becomes more urgent every day

**Pattern: Sacrifice myself first when stress hits:**
- No lunch two days in row
- No bathroom until 4:30pm
- Stay late dealing with fires
- This is the "operational readiness" Dean talked about
- Can't lead well if I'm depleted

**Ice bath holding the pattern even on brutal days:**
- Argument with Kristyn, Maddy mistake, no lunch, stayed until 6pm
- Still did ice bath/sauna
- Still no alcohol desire
- This is proof the routine is becoming foundation

**Kristyn cooking = love language:**
- We argued this morning
- She still cooked dinner tonight
- That's partnership
- That's 25+ years showing up
- Food is how she says "I love you even when we fight"

**Energy Patterns:**
- **Started day:** 7/10 (good Whoop recovery from strategic Tuesday sleep)
- **Ended day:** 6/10 (exhausted but grateful for ice bath and Kristyn)
- **What drained me:** Morning argument, Maddy mistake stress, no lunch, stayed too late, staffing frustration
- **What energized me:** Ice bath/sauna routine, Kristyn cooking dinner (reconnection), no alcohol pattern holding

**Tomorrow Preview:**
- Continue Maddy situation (likely last week)
- MUST eat lunch - non-negotiable
- Protect ice bath time again (5 misses left, can't waste them)
- Check in with Kristyn - morning argument behind us?

**Gratitude:**

I'm grateful Kristyn cooked dinner tonight even though we argued this morning. That's what 25+ years looks like - not perfect, but showing up. She fed me even when she could have stayed mad. That's love.

I'm grateful I did the ice bath despite the brutal day. Maddy's mistake, no lunch, stayed until 6pm - all of it could have been an excuse to skip it. But I didn't. The pattern held.

I'm grateful I didn't drink tonight. Old Ricky would be half a bottle in after a day like today. New Ricky did ice bath and had dinner with his wife.

I'm grateful I learned the staff lesson: check work before it goes to customers. I've been avoiding that management responsibility. Today forced me to see it.

### Thursday, November 13, 2025 - Day 10 of Q1

**Energy Level:** 7/10
**Mood:** Determined but realistic
**Woke:** [Early as usual]

**Physical State:**
- **Ribs:** Sore and aching
- **Foot:** Stiff
- **Overall capacity:** "One thing at a time"

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Whoop Recovery:** 45% (low - body stressed from week)
- Body telling me to manage expectations today

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **Action Network meeting + Gold Coast client visit - be fully present** → Rock #2 (MRR/business relationships), P3 (protecting clients from cyber threats)
   - Morning: Action Network breakfast
   - All day: Gold Coast client visit (relationship building + service delivery)
   - Afternoon: KBN Christmas function
   - Long day ahead - presence matters more than perfection

2. **EAT LUNCH - NON-NEGOTIABLE** → Energy management + operational readiness
   - Two days skipped lunch → low energy spirals
   - Body at 45% recovery already needs fuel
   - One thing at a time capacity = must fuel properly
   - This is not optional

3. **BNI prep + ice bath tonight after KBN** → Rock #4 (ice bath 90%+) + responsibility to BNI chapter
   - **BNI prep MUST be done tonight:** Friday 6:30 AM meeting, no option to do it morning
   - **Ice bath:** 7/9 days (77.8%), 5 misses remaining - cannot afford to skip
   - Full day ahead but committed to responsibilities
   - Plan: BNI prep + ice bath both happen after KBN function

**Intention for the day:**
"One thing at a time. Present and disciplined."

This is a full day but I've committed to my responsibilities. BNI prep happens tonight - period. Ice bath happens tonight - period. Everything else gets my full presence in the moment.

**Morning moment:**
Kristyn brought me coffee in bed this morning. Yesterday we argued. Last night she cooked dinner. This morning - coffee in bed before my marathon day. That's 25 years. That's partnership.

**Notes:**
- Full day: Action Network → Gold Coast client (all day) → KBN Christmas function → BNI prep → Ice bath
- Capacity is "one thing at a time" - acknowledge this, work with it
- 45% Whoop recovery - body needs fuel and rest between activities
- Ribs sore, foot stiff - manage pain, don't push through stupidly
- BNI is 6:30 AM Friday - no wiggle room on prep tonight

**Potential obstacles:**
- **Long day fatigue:** Plan = eat lunch, stay present, don't try to multitask
- **Skipping BNI prep temptation:** Not an option - I have responsibility as VP
- **Skipping ice bath temptation:** Not an option - only 5 misses left, pattern must hold
- **Travel time eating schedule:** Pack food if needed for Gold Coast client visit

**Confidence level:** 7/10 - Challenging day ahead but commitments are clear and I'm disciplined enough to follow through

- "I need to recognise when I am happy and content"
- This is growth - noticing when life is good, not just focusing on struggles

**Struggles/Frustrations:**
- Minor frustrations today
- Conscious choice: "not worth dwelling on"
- Grateful for problems being small enough to dismiss

**Fitness & Body (continued):**
- Long day driving and working
- Intermittent fasting during drive
- Body handled marathon travel day well
- Ice bath miss disappointing but gym was closed (circumstantial, not choice-based)

**Diet:**
- **Breakfast:** NONE - Made love to Kristyn instead (conscious choice, good memory)
- **11am:** Chicken roll (higher protein choice) + coffee
- **During drive:** Snacked on bad food for distraction, didn't go overboard
- **6pm:** Satay curry at home - Kristyn made it (her dad's recipe)
- **Water:** Should have drunk more during drive
  - Got Powerade for electrolytes
  - Hydrated before bed
  - **Need habit:** Water bottle always in car
- ✅ **Alcohol:** None Thursday night (BNI prep), none Friday (pattern holding despite no ice bath)

**Family Moments:**

**Kristyn:**
- **Morning:** Made love instead of eating breakfast - "good memory"
- **Evening:** She made satay curry (her dad's recipe) when I got home after 7+ hour day
- **Storm handling:** Home alone during dangerous hail storm, responsible for keeping cars out of hail
- **What stood out:** "She was wearing something revealing and being sexy"
- **What I noticed:** "She is strong when needed"
- **What I feel:** "I do love her a lot"
- Partnership: She handles home crisis while I'm hours away, I come home to her care and dinner ready

**Parker:**
- Did not talk to Parker today
- He works Friday nights
- Thought about him

**Ronin:**
- Did not talk to Ronin today
- He works Friday nights
- Thought about him

**Thoughts & Ideas:**

**Coach recommended "The Way of the Superior Man":**
- Started listening during drive
- Mind wasn't in learning mood after marathon Thursday + long Friday drive
- Will listen together with Kristyn on Saturday drive
- Intentional: sharing learning with her, not just consuming alone

**Water bottle habit needed:**
- Long drives = dehydration risk
- Should have drunk more water during Chinchilla trip
- Got Powerade for electrolytes after realizing
- New habit: water bottle always in car for travel days

**Mindset shift on gratitude:**
- Recognizing when I'm happy and content
- Not using reflection tool to "wallow"
- Not treating my life as "the hardest thing in the world"
- This is maturity: acknowledging when things are good

**Kristyn's strength:**
- Alone during dangerous hail storm
- Took responsibility for protecting cars
- Handled it while I was 3 hours away
- "She is strong when needed" - I see this, I appreciate this

**Customers calling office win:**
- Delegation finally working
- Systems functioning without me being constant contact point
- Business scalability improving
- More time for strategic work and client service (like Chinchilla trip)

**Energy Patterns:**
- **Started day:** 6/10 (moderate after Thursday marathon)
- **Ended day:** 8/10 (satisfied, accomplished, content)
- **What drained me:** 7+ hours total driving, tinnitus was loud this morning, long fasting window
- **What energized me:** BNI presentation success, Farm Angels client happiness, Kristyn making dinner, making love in morning, customers calling office (delegation win), making it home safe, Kristyn being strong and sexy

**Tomorrow Preview:**
- Saturday ahead
- Will listen to "The Way of the Superior Man" with Kristyn during drive
- Recovery from back-to-back marathon days (Thursday + Friday)
- Protect ice bath routine - only 4 misses remaining, margin very tight

**Gratitude:**

I'm grateful for this Friday. It was a pretty good day. BNI went well because I stayed sober Thursday to be sharp. The Chinchilla trip was 7+ hours but the clients were so happy - that's why I do this work. Customers are calling the office instead of me constantly - that's the systems working finally.

I'm grateful I made it home safe through that spectacular lightning storm. I'm grateful Kristyn handled the hail alone and kept our cars safe - she is strong when needed, and I love her for that.

I'm grateful for the morning - making love instead of eating breakfast was a good memory, a good choice. And I'm grateful she made her dad's satay curry when I got home late, and that she was being sexy and wearing something revealing. After 25+ years, she still shows up like that. That's everything.

I'm grateful for the mindset shift today - recognizing that my life is not the hardest thing in the world, that I am happy and content. The small frustrations aren't worth dwelling on. This is what all the work is for - these days where I notice I'm actually doing well, actually happy, actually building the life I want.

The ice bath miss stings - only 4 misses left for the quarter now - but the gym was closed. I'll get back to it tomorrow. The pattern is still holding: no ice bath but still no drinking. That's progress too.

### Friday, November 14, 2025 - Day 11 of Q1

**MARATHON TRAVEL DAY**

**Energy Level:** 6/10
**Mood:** Moderate energy, determined despite challenges
**Woke:** 8:30am (late after Thursday marathon day)

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Whoop Recovery:** 65% (yellow - body not fully recharged)
- **Note:** Thursday was extreme - got home very late, too tired for evening reflection

**Physical State:**
- **Body:** Feels GOOD physically
- **Tinnitus:** LOUD this morning (ringing bad)
- **Pain:** Standard (leg, ribs, arm)
- **Overall:** Body good, ears bad - the P1 mission context (pain that drives drinking habit)

**Breakfast:**
- NONE - Fasting until at least 11am
- **Context:** 6+ hour drive today (3h each way to Chinchilla)
- Long gap given marathon day ahead

**Yesterday Context (Thursday Nov 13):**
- **MARATHON DAY:** BNI presentation 6:30am → Action Network meeting → Gold Coast client all day → KBN party → got home very late
- **BIG WIN:** NO DRINKING at KBN party despite long day and being hungry
- **Ice bath:** ❌ MISSED - Gym was closed before he finished work (marathon day ended too late)
- Too tired for evening reflection - did it Friday morning instead

**Q1 Ice Bath Tracking - CRITICAL STATUS:**
- **Current:** 7/11 days = 63.6% (DOWN from 70%)
- **Target:** 90%+ = 81+ days out of 90
- **Misses used:** 4/9 allowed
- **Misses remaining:** 5 for next 79 days
- **Status:** 🟡 YELLOW - Getting tight, need to protect this

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **BNI breakfast 6:30am presentation** → Rock #1 (hiring connections), Rock #2 (MRR/business relationships), P2 (integrity in business)
   - Already completed before morning ritual
   - VP role - setting culture standard
   - Mission-aligned networking

2. **3-hour drive to Chinchilla → client work → 3-hour drive home** → Rock #2 (MRR), P3 (protecting businesses from cyber threats)
   - Fix internet for Chinchilla client (service excellence)
   - 6+ hours total driving = limited productive work time
   - Client service is main deliverable
   - Travel day reality: most of day is windshield time

3. **Protect ice bath tonight despite late return - CRITICAL** → Rock #4 (ice bath 90%+ consistency)
   - Only 5 misses remaining for 79 days left
   - Thursday miss understandable (gym closed after marathon day) but Rock #4 getting tight
   - Cannot afford another miss
   - Pattern proven: ice bath → no drinking → quality time with Kristyn
   - Late return makes this challenging but non-negotiable

**Additional Context:**
- **TruPeer action item:** Get Kristyn access to TruPeer portal + attend TruPeer calls together
  - Building partnership in business growth strategy
  - Not time-sensitive today but capture for follow-up

**Intention for the day:**
**"Be fully present in service and fully present when I get home - despite the long drive, the tinnitus, and the fatigue."**

This is a travel day. Most of my time is driving. But when I'm with the client, I'm 100% there fixing their problem. And when I get home late tonight, I don't bring exhaustion and frustration through the door - I do the ice bath, I show up for Kristyn, I protect the pattern that's working. The tinnitus is loud, the fasting is long, the drive is brutal - none of that is an excuse to break what I'm building.

**Potential obstacles & response plans:**

**Obstacle 1: Tinnitus is LOUD this morning**
- **Response:** This is P1 mission context - the pain that drives drinking. Acknowledge it, manage it, don't let it dictate the day. Ice bath tonight helps reset.

**Obstacle 2: Fasting until 11am with 6+ hour drive**
- **Response:** Long gap given marathon day ahead. Pack food for Chinchilla? Or eat substantial meal at 11am to fuel the drive back?

**Obstacle 3: Late return home + ice bath**
- **Response:** Non-negotiable. Only 5 misses left for quarter. Pattern working: ice bath → no drinking → better with Kristyn. Plan gym time before driving home or immediately when arriving home.

**Obstacle 4: Travel day = temptation to skip lunch/fuel**
- **Response:** Pattern from this week - skip lunch → low energy spiral. Must eat even on road. Client service requires energy.

**Notes:**
- Thursday marathon day: 6:30am BNI → Action Network → Gold Coast all day → KBN party → home very late
- Thursday BIG WIN: NO DRINKING at KBN party (despite long day, hungry, social pressure)
- This is back-to-back marathon days - Friday is recovery while working
- Ice bath miss Thursday was circumstantial (gym closed after marathon day ended too late)
- Body feels good physically despite moderate energy (65% Whoop recovery)
- Tinnitus adds extra challenge layer today

**Confidence level:** 6/10 - Realistic about challenging day (travel, tinnitus, fasting, late return) but committed to service and protecting ice bath routine

### Saturday, November 15, 2025 - Day 12 of Q1

**POTTSVILLE WEEKEND - KRISTYN'S ROTARY TRAINING**

**Energy Level:** 7/10
**Mood:** Feeling good - beautiful morning start with my wife
**Woke:** Early from sunrise + animal sounds (crows, birds, etc.)

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Whoop Data:** 6.7 hours sleep (95.6% efficiency - excellent)
- **Recovery:** 47% (yellow zone - needs more total hours)
- **Sleep Breakdown:**
  - Deep sleep: 1.7 hours (good)
  - REM sleep: 2.0 hours (good)
  - Light sleep: adequate
- **Analysis:** Great sleep efficiency and quality stages, but body needs more total hours for full recovery
- **Sunrise wake:** Early wake from sunlight + animal sounds (crows, birds calling)
- **Sleep plan:** Discussed eye masks and earplugs with Kristyn to help sleep through sunrise and animal noise

**Morning Start (Beautiful):**
- Made love to Kristyn this morning
- Brought her tea in bed
- She's lying next to me on iPad doing puzzles
- This is what life is supposed to feel like

**Physical State:**
- **Energy:** Feeling good but tired from yesterday's long drive to Pottsville
- **Body:** Normal aches present
- **Pain level:** Standard (leg, ribs, arm)
- **Tinnitus:** 24/7 as always

**Weekend Context:**
- **Location:** Pottsville, North NSW (beachside town south of Gold Coast)
- **Why here:** Kristyn's Rotary District President training weekend
- **Today:** Kristyn at training all day (first time as President-elect, excited and nervous)
- **Tomorrow:** Rotary AGM (Annual General Meeting)
- **Travel:** Drove Mustang down yesterday (long drive, hence tiredness)

**Kristyn's State:**
- Excited about Rotary President training
- A bit nervous (first time in this leadership role)
- This is important to her - becoming club president next year
- I'm here to support without influencing

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **Support Kristyn through Rotary training (without influencing)** → Relationship priority, partnership, her leadership development
   - Drop her at training
   - Pick her up when finished
   - Success metric: She talks about what she learned/experienced when I pick her up
   - My role: Be present, listen, support - don't try to fix or guide
   - Her journey, not mine

2. **Find waterfall/creek near Murwillumbah for cold mountain water swim** → Rock #4 (cold exposure 90%+ days), body reset, adventure
   - Can't do ice bath on the road (no gym access)
   - Cold mountain water swim counts as cold exposure
   - Resets body after long drive yesterday
   - Nature, adventure, presence
   - Near Murwillumbah (inland from Pottsville)
   - Scout location while Kristyn at training

3. **Celebratory evening with Kristyn** → Relationship priority, partnership, celebration
   - Nice dinner together (she's worked hard in training all day)
   - Maybe live music somewhere
   - Controlled drinks if we choose (conscious choice, not habit)
   - Good sleep boundary (don't stay out too late - AGM tomorrow morning)
   - Quality time together celebrating her training completion

**Intention for the day:**
**"Ignore time and not be in a rush. Notice small things on the travel. It will be a good day. Taking the Mustang - nothing better than a v8 and a pretty wife."**

This is about presence. Slowing down. Noticing details. The sound of the Mustang. The scenery between Pottsville and Murwillumbah. The cold mountain water. The look on Kristyn's face when she talks about her training. The dinner together. The music if we find it. Not rushing. Not checking phone constantly. Not being somewhere else mentally. Here. Now. With her. In this beautiful place.

**Notes:**
- **Rock #4 plan:** Cold mountain water swim counts as cold exposure (can't ice bath on road)
- **Mustang road trip:** V8 soundtrack, pretty wife, scenic drive - exactly what life's about
- **Kristyn's first President training:** Huge milestone for her leadership development
- **Weekend timing:** Today training, tonight celebration, tomorrow AGM
- **Location scouting:** Murwillumbah waterfalls/creeks = cold mountain water
- **Sleep discussion:** Eye masks and earplugs to help both of us sleep through sunrise + animal sounds

**Potential obstacles & response plans:**

**Obstacle 1: Temptation to "help" Kristyn with Rotary training**
- **Response:** This is HER journey. My role is support, not influence. Listen when she shares, don't solve or guide. She's capable - let her discover her own leadership style.

**Obstacle 2: Can't find good waterfall/creek for cold water swim**
- **Response:** Research while Kristyn at training. Ask locals. Use maps. Murwillumbah area has mountain streams - they exist, just need to find one accessible.

**Obstacle 3: Celebratory drinking could spiral (pattern risk)**
- **Response:** Conscious choice, controlled amount, food first, good sleep boundary. This isn't nightly habit (what we're breaking), this is celebration with wife. Know the difference.

**Obstacle 4: Tiredness from yesterday's long drive**
- **Response:** Already feeling good despite tired. Cold water swim will reset body. Don't overschedule today - the plan is simple: drop Kristyn, find creek, swim, pick up Kristyn, dinner, celebrate. That's enough.

**Confidence level:** 8/10 - Beautiful morning start, clear intention, simple plan, quality time with Kristyn, adventure and presence. This is what the work is for - these weekends.

**Gratitude:**

I'm grateful for this day with Kristyn. From singing in the Mustang on the drive to making love before sleep, this is what all the work is for - these days where I'm fully present with my wife, supporting her growth, adventuring together, celebrating controlled.

I'm grateful for the Killan Falls moment. The cold mountain water under the waterfall, sitting in peace after, the clear air and thinking time. My body needed that reset and my mind needed that clarity.

I'm grateful I didn't buy that beer at the services club. I sat there alone, easy to slip, easy to rationalize. I didn't. Just sat and thought. That's discipline becoming character.

I'm grateful for Kristyn's excitement about Rotary. Watching her eyes light up sharing what she learned, seeing her step into leadership. She's nervous and excited and growing. I'm proud of her.

I'm grateful for controlled evening drinking - one wine each, shared duck, walking home in the rain. This is celebration with wife, not nightly habit. I know the difference now.

I'm grateful for the dress she bought that looks fantastic on her. Grateful for soaking our feet in that clear creek together. Grateful for the strawberry dessert we shared. Grateful for her hand in mine walking back through the rain.

This is the life I'm building. Not perfect (should have skipped the fried food), but present, intentional, connected. Today I was the husband she deserves. That matters more than anything.

### Sunday, November 16, 2025 - Day 13 of Q1

**POTTSVILLE WEEKEND - DAY 2: ROTARY AGM + DRIVE HOME**

**Energy Level:** 7/10
**Mood:** Rested, present, still in Pottsville
**Woke:** Earlier than usual (NSW daylight saving - up an hour earlier than normal body clock)

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Whoop Recovery:** 81% (GREEN - excellent after controlled drinking)
- **HRV:** 52.7 (solid)
- **Resting HR:** 67 bpm
- **Sleep Performance:** 82%
- **Hours in bed:** 8.5 hours
- **Sleep efficiency:** 96% (excellent)
- **Analysis:** The 2-drink discipline showed in recovery data - body recovered well from Saturday's controlled celebration

**Morning Context:**
- Still in Pottsville (beachside town)
- NSW daylight saving putting them up earlier than usual
- About to walk to beach with Kristyn
- Then cafe breakfast
- Then Rotary AGM (where Kristyn had her training yesterday)
- Driving home to Brisbane after AGM

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **Ocean swim at beach during morning walk with Kristyn** → Rock #4 (cold exposure 90%+ days)
   - Currently 8/13 days (61.5%) - building back toward 90% target
   - Yesterday: Killan Falls waterfall (counted as cold exposure)
   - Today: Ocean swim opportunity during beach walk
   - Natural cold exposure work while enjoying Pottsville before leaving
   - Walking there anyway - stack the win

2. **Support Kristyn at Rotary AGM** → Relationship priority, her leadership journey
   - She was VERY excited after training yesterday
   - Today she's President-elect at the AGM
   - My role: be present, be proud, listen to her experience
   - Same approach as yesterday: support without influencing
   - This is her leadership growth - I'm the supportive husband

3. **Drive home safely + Weekly Review tonight (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** → Telos system integrity, Q1 accountability, Week 2 closure
   - This is Week 2 (Nov 11-17) ending
   - Weekly review is THE most important practice in entire Telos system
   - 6 full days of journal entries this week to analyze
   - Three persona feedback waiting (Supportive Coach, Balanced Advisor, Brutal Truth-Teller)
   - Where daily data becomes wisdom
   - Must happen tonight after getting home and settled

**Intention for the day:**
"Be present for the last moments in Pottsville, be the supportive husband at her AGM, and honor the weekly review tonight - because the learning loop is what makes all of this work."

**Breakfast Plan:**
- Cafe breakfast after beach walk with Kristyn
- Eating together before AGM
- No fasting today - fueling for drive home

**Notes:**
- Beach walk = ocean swim opportunity (Rock #4)
- Rotary AGM = Kristyn showing up as President-elect with all her new training
- Drive home after AGM - back to Brisbane area
- Weekly review TONIGHT - non-negotiable, Week 2 closure
- 81% Whoop recovery = proof that 2-drink discipline works
- Daylight saving time difference (NSW vs QLD)

**Potential obstacles & response plans:**

**Obstacle 1: Skip ocean swim because "we're just walking"**
- **Response:** This IS the priority. 8/13 days Rock #4 needs every win. Ocean swim is natural cold exposure, and you're walking to the beach anyway. Do it intentionally.

**Obstacle 2: Too tired from Pottsville weekend to do weekly review tonight**
- **Response:** Non-negotiable. This is the learning loop that makes everything else work. Even 30 minutes tonight is better than skipping it. Week 2 journal entries are rich with data.

**Obstacle 3: Long drive home after AGM**
- **Response:** Drive safely. Kristyn is with you. V8 Mustang, good roads, get home safely. The weekly review happens tonight regardless of tiredness.

**Confidence level:** 8/10 - Rested, recovered (81% Whoop), clear priorities, beautiful morning with Kristyn, supporting her leadership day, ocean swim planned, weekly review scheduled tonight

## Week 2 (Nov 11-17)

### Tuesday, November 11, 2025 - Day 8 of Q1

**REMEMBRANCE DAY - Lest We Forget**

**Energy Level:** 9/10
**Mood:** Very good mood
**Woke:** 4:51am (body clock dialed in)

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Whoop Score:** 90% performance ✅
- Quality: Excellent

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **Remembrance Day - RSL badge selling (QLD government building)** → P1 (veteran welfare fundraising), duty, service above self
   - Selling badges to raise money for RSL and veteran welfare
   - Everyone is QLD government employees
   - Watching government workers - lots nice and genuine, rest are "pigs at a trough"
   - Some try to pay with state cards (I point it out, they switch to personal cards)
   - New government this year, may be different
   - **The reality:** Veterans volunteering to raise money because military/government don't care once you leave or get hurt

2. **KBN meeting (Key Business Network)** → Rock #1 (hiring connections), Rock #2 (MRR/business relationships)
   - Haven't been in a while
   - Sent substitutes who I think will get something out of it
   - Building mission-aligned network

3. **Protect ice bath time tonight - NON-NEGOTIABLE** → Rock #4 (missed last night Day 7, now 4/7 Week 2, only 6 misses left for quarter)
   - **CRITICAL:** Plan with Kristyn NOW - what time leaving together? What does she need to eat BEFORE we go?
   - Cannot miss again - margin too tight

**Intention for the day:**
**"Be the proof that veterans rebuild ourselves - the system won't do it."**

The military and government do not care once you leave or are hurt and cannot serve anymore. It is veterans volunteering to raise money and awareness. We rebuild our own lives because the system that broke us won't.

**Notes:**

**Maddy situation update:**
- Had conversation yesterday Monday Nov 10
- Reduced her hours
- She turned up way too early this morning and started working
- I pointed out: "This is not a job where you can turn up whenever you feel like it"
- This week will more than likely be her last week
- Decision made, executing, mental energy freed up

**Ice bath MISS last night (Monday Nov 10):**
- Week 2 status: 0/1 days so far (missed Monday night)
- Overall Q1: 4/7 days (57.1%), 3 misses used, 6 misses remaining
- **What happened:** Set aside time to leave early, waiting for Kristyn (goal is go together)
- Busy day, she was stressed, wouldn't express needs
- Asked twice about leaving, she said nothing until too late
- **Pattern noticed:** If she asks about food before leaving office = she's hungry
- **Choice made:** If I went to gym, she wouldn't eat until after 8pm. Chose feeding Kristyn over ice bath.
- **Real tension:** Only 6 misses left for quarter. Need to solve this communication pattern.
- **Tonight's plan:** Talk with Kristyn THIS MORNING about tonight - time, food plan, both go together

**Foundation priority removed:**
- Moved to 2 years out in 10-year business plan
- Not a Q1 Rock anymore

---

### Evening Reflection

  - Sold out of badges
  - Raised over $40,000 for RSL over past few days

  - Different vibe to Action Group and BNI
  - Good speakers
  - Holding onto roots - where I started business networking 7+ years ago
  - Breakfast: eggs, halloumi cheese, little sausage (enjoyed but prefer simpler eggs/oats now)

- **Priority 3: Protect ice bath time tonight** ✗ MISSED - Disappointed
  - Late client caused missed workout AND ice bath
  - Had Rotary meeting + had to cook dinner
  - Chose reasonable bedtime over ice bath (smart for recovery)
  - **Q1 Rock #4 status:** 6/8 days = 75% (below 90% target), used 2 of 9 allowed misses in Week 2

**Fitness & Body:**
- ❌ **No exercise/workout today** - made me feel bloated, not a good feeling
- ❌ **Ice bath:** MISSED (late client caused schedule collapse)
- **Q1 Ice Bath Tracking:** 6/8 days (75.0%), 4 misses used total, 5 misses remaining
  - Week 1: 4/6 days (66.7%)
  - Week 2: 2/2 days so far (100% this week but overall quarter slipping)
- **Body check:** Felt bloated without workout, low energy by end of day

- **Tinnitus:** 24/7 as always

**Wins today:**

**🎉 TATTERSALS CLUB - ALCOHOL CONTROL VICTORY:**
- Stopped at Tattersals Club where RSL guys were having lunch
- Old pattern: Would have stayed, had long lunch, started drinking
- **NEW PATTERN:** Did NOT drink, did NOT stay for long lunch, went back to work
- This is the ice bath routine working even on a miss day
- This is proof the pattern is changing

**Remembrance Day success:**

- Good time with other RSL members
- Living P1 mission (veterans helping veterans)

**KBN meeting fulfilling:**

- Good speakers, good connections
- Holding onto business networking roots (7+ years ago)

**Family connection:**
- Parker call on drive home - good chat
- Kristyn joined conversation once home
- Dinner together (steak, roast pumpkin from garden, asparagus)

**Struggles/Frustrations:**

**Ice bath miss - disappointed:**
- Late client caused missed workout AND ice bath
- Had Rotary meeting + had to cook dinner
- Chose reasonable bedtime over staying up late for ice bath
- **Tension:** Only 5 misses remaining for quarter, 75% vs 90% target
- **Reality:** Late clients threatening the routine that makes everything else work

**No fitness = bloated feeling:**
- Didn't workout today
- Body felt bloated, not good
- Pattern confirmed: movement matters for how I feel

**Skipped lunch = low energy:**
- No lunch today

**Diet:**
- **Breakfast:** KBN breakfast - eggs, halloumi, little sausage (enjoyed but prefer simpler eggs/oats now)
- **Lunch:** SKIPPED (contributed to low energy)
- **Dinner:** Cooked steak, roast pumpkin from garden, asparagus - clean food, no excess oils, easy to digest despite eating late

- ✅ **Alcohol:** NONE (Tattersals win - huge)

**Family Moments:**

- Love hearing his voice
- Proud of how he handles pressure

**Kristyn:**
- Joined Parker conversation once I got home
- Had dinner together (steak, pumpkin, asparagus)
- She's been understanding about busy week

**Ronin:**
- No contact today
- Will try to connect this week

**Thoughts & Ideas:**

**Tattersals moment = proof of pattern change:**
- Guys having lunch, drinking, social pressure to stay
- Old Ricky: Would have joined, stayed for long lunch, started drinking
- New Ricky: Said hello, didn't drink, didn't stay, went back to work
- **This is what the ice bath routine has built** - even on a miss day, the pattern held
- The discipline is becoming automatic

**Pattern confirmed: No fitness → bloated, skipped lunch → low energy:**
- Body is telling me what it needs
- Movement matters for how I feel
- Fuel matters for energy throughout day
- Can't ignore these signals without consequences

**Late clients vs protected routines:**
- Late client caused schedule collapse
- Missed workout and ice bath
- Only 5 misses remaining for quarter
- Need to protect the routines that make leadership possible
- Can't serve clients well if I'm not taking care of foundation

**Parker exam stress:**
- He's nervous about uni exams this week
- But I know he's a strong man
- Kristyn and I raised him to handle pressure
- Proud of how he approaches challenges

**Energy Patterns:**
- **Started day:** 5/10
- **Ended day:** Flat/low
- **What drained me:** Skipped lunch, no workout, late client stress, busy schedule
- **What energized me:** Tattersals alcohol control win, Remembrance Day success, KBN meeting, Parker call

**Tomorrow Preview:**
- Protect ice bath time - NON-NEGOTIABLE (only 5 misses left)
- Get workout in if possible
- Don't skip lunch
- Continue Maddy situation (last week likely)

**Gratitude:**

I'm grateful for the Tattersals moment. That was the old pattern staring me in the face - guys having lunch, drinking, social time - and I didn't take the bait. I said hello, stayed sober, went back to work. That's the ice bath routine working even on a day I miss it. That's proof the pattern is changing at a deep level.

I'm grateful for Remembrance Day - selling badges with other veterans, raising money because the system won't take care of us. We take care of each other. That's always been the way.

I'm grateful for Parker's voice on the phone. He's stressed about exams but he's strong. Kristyn and I know he'll handle it.

And I'm grateful that even though I missed the ice bath tonight, I chose reasonable bedtime over pushing too hard. Recovery matters. Tomorrow I get back to it.

### Wednesday, November 12, 2025 - Day 9 of Q1

**REMEMBRANCE DAY WEEK CONTINUES**

**Energy Level:** 7/10
**Mood:** Weird mood, mind already racing ahead
**Woke:** 4:15am (strategic early bedtime 8:30pm Tuesday paid off)

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Whoop Score:** 91% performance ✅ (excellent recovery)
- **Sleep:** ~7.75 hours (bed 8:30 PM, woke 4:15 AM)
- **Quality:** 9/10
- **HRV:** 55 (UP from 40 - significant improvement)
- **Resting heart rate:** 64 (DOWN - excellent)
- **Strategic choice validated:** Chose sleep over missed gym/ice bath Tuesday → body responded perfectly

**Morning Context:**
- Body clock excellent - 4:15am wake
- Strategic sleep decision Tuesday (annoyed from missing gym/ice bath, frustrated with Rotary) paid off massively
- **Pain:** 6/10
  - Foot feeling a little better
  - **Tinnitus is BAD this morning** - constant ringing, no peace
  - Leg and knee aching already
  - Management approach: "Will just ignore it as normal"

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **Ice bath tonight - NON-NEGOTIABLE** → Rock #4 (ice bath 90%+ consistency)
   - **Q1 Status:** 6/8 days (75%), only 7 misses remaining for quarter - AT RISK
   - Pattern proven: Ice bath → no drinking → good sleep → better HRV
   - Tuesday miss was strategic (chose sleep), but margin is too tight now
   - Cannot miss again

2. **Chase late customer quotes + address staffing gap** → Rock #1 (Hire mission-aligned staff), Rock #2 (MRR growth)
   - User frustration evident: "Too much of my time is taken with small things that my staff should be able to do"
   - Notice what tasks he's doing that staff should handle
   - Late quotes need following up
   - Maddy situation closing this week - hiring gap real

3. **Don't skip lunch - fuel for calm/reflective state** → Daily intention + energy management
   - Tuesday pattern: Skipped lunch → low energy spiral → flat mood by evening
   - Needs fuel to manage the day effectively
   - Body telling what it needs - listen

**Intention for the day:**
**"Today I choose calm and focus over reaction. I manage my time, my energy, and my response to challenges - including this tinnitus, this pain, and these staffing frustrations. I'm building something new (the system), not just fighting fires. The day doesn't run me."**

**Notes:**

**New system progress:**
- Excited about it
- NOT time-sensitive today
- Should be able to start using and testing soon
- Building something that will solve the "too much time on small things" frustration

**Background from Tuesday Nov 11:**
- Day: 6/10
- **🎉 HUGE WIN:** Tattersals Club - didn't drink with guys at lunch, went back to work (proof pattern changing)
- Remembrance Day: $40K+ raised for RSL, sold out badges
- Ice bath missed (chose sleep - strategic recovery decision)
- No workout - felt bloated
- Skipped lunch - low energy by evening
- Rotary meeting: "Joan talks too much, old ladies circle"
- Good Parker call (uni exams this week) + Kristyn dinner

**Potential obstacles:**
- **Tinnitus is BAD this morning:** Management plan = ignore as normal, don't let it dictate mood
- **Late clients:** Protect ice bath time tonight - cannot let client urgency override health foundation
- **Staffing frustration:** Notice tasks that shouldn't be his, gather data for hiring plan
- **Lunch skip temptation:** Set alarm if needed, non-negotiable fuel

**Confidence level:** 7/10 - Clear priorities, good recovery from Tuesday sleep, intention is strong

### Evening Reflection

  - Skipped lunch again
  - No bathroom until 4:30pm

  - Week 1: 4/6 days (66.7%)
  - Week 2: 3/3 days so far (100% this week, pulling overall quarter back up)

**Wins today:**

**Ice bath streak back on track:**

- 3/3 days this week (Week 2 at 100%)
- Pattern holding: did ice bath → no drinking desire

**No alcohol:**
- ✅ Zero alcohol despite stressful day
- Ice bath routine working even on hard days
- Old pattern would be wine by now

**Learned important staff lesson:**
- Maddy's ticket mistake taught me to check work before it goes to customers
- Can't just trust and hope anymore
- This is part of management I've been avoiding

**Reconnected with Kristyn:**
- Morning argument about nothing
- She cooked dinner despite the tension
- That's 25+ years of partnership showing up
- Love language: feeding me even when we're not perfect

**Struggles/Frustrations:**

**Morning argument with Kristyn:**
- Fought about "nothing really"
- Started day tense and disconnected
- Carried that stress into work

**Maddy ticket mistake - major frustration:**
- Sent wrong information to customer about their ticket
- Had to fix it quickly under pressure
- Lesson: Can't just trust her work anymore, need to check it first
- Staff situation more urgent than I thought

**Skipped lunch AGAIN:**
- No food until dinner

- Stayed at office until 6pm dealing with fires
- Pattern: I sacrifice my needs when stress hits

**Stayed too long at office:**
- 6pm before I left
- Exhausted by time I got to gym
- Late dinner, late bedtime consequence

**Staffing frustration building:**
- Too much time on small things staff should handle
- Maddy unreliability + mistakes = can't delegate confidently
- Hiring gap painfully real now

**Diet:**
- **Breakfast:** [Not tracked - check Whoop or recall]
- **Lunch:** ❌ SKIPPED (second day in row)
- **Dinner:** Kristyn cooked for me (specific meal not captured - what did she make?)
- **Water:** [Not tracked but probably low]
- **Coffee:** [Not tracked]
- **Supplements:** [Not tracked]
- ✅ **Alcohol:** NONE (despite stressful day)

**Family Moments:**

**Kristyn:**
- **Morning:** Argued about nothing really, started day tense
- **Evening:** She cooked dinner for me despite the argument
- **What this means:** 25+ years together - she shows love by feeding me even when we're not perfect
- **Reconnection:** We're okay. The cooking was her way of saying "we're still us"
- This is what partnership looks like - showing up even on hard days

**Parker:**
- No contact today
- Still doing uni exams this week

**Ronin:**
- No contact today
- Need to connect this week

**Thoughts & Ideas:**

**Staff lesson from Maddy mistake:**
- Can't just trust and delegate blindly anymore
- Need to check work before it goes to customers
- This is the management work I've been avoiding
- Hiring becomes more urgent every day

**Pattern: Sacrifice myself first when stress hits:**
- No lunch two days in row
- No bathroom until 4:30pm
- Stay late dealing with fires
- This is the "operational readiness" Dean talked about
- Can't lead well if I'm depleted

**Ice bath holding the pattern even on brutal days:**
- Argument with Kristyn, Maddy mistake, no lunch, stayed until 6pm
- Still did ice bath/sauna
- Still no alcohol desire
- This is proof the routine is becoming foundation

**Kristyn cooking = love language:**
- We argued this morning
- She still cooked dinner tonight
- That's partnership
- That's 25+ years showing up
- Food is how she says "I love you even when we fight"

**Energy Patterns:**
- **Started day:** 7/10 (good Whoop recovery from strategic Tuesday sleep)
- **Ended day:** 6/10 (exhausted but grateful for ice bath and Kristyn)
- **What drained me:** Morning argument, Maddy mistake stress, no lunch, stayed too late, staffing frustration
- **What energized me:** Ice bath/sauna routine, Kristyn cooking dinner (reconnection), no alcohol pattern holding

**Tomorrow Preview:**
- Continue Maddy situation (likely last week)
- MUST eat lunch - non-negotiable
- Protect ice bath time again (5 misses left, can't waste them)
- Check in with Kristyn - morning argument behind us?

**Gratitude:**

I'm grateful Kristyn cooked dinner tonight even though we argued this morning. That's what 25+ years looks like - not perfect, but showing up. She fed me even when she could have stayed mad. That's love.

I'm grateful I did the ice bath despite the brutal day. Maddy's mistake, no lunch, stayed until 6pm - all of it could have been an excuse to skip it. But I didn't. The pattern held.

I'm grateful I didn't drink tonight. Old Ricky would be half a bottle in after a day like today. New Ricky did ice bath and had dinner with his wife.

I'm grateful I learned the staff lesson: check work before it goes to customers. I've been avoiding that management responsibility. Today forced me to see it.

### Thursday, November 13, 2025 - Day 10 of Q1

**Energy Level:** 7/10
**Mood:** Determined but realistic
**Woke:** [Early as usual]

**Physical State:**
- **Ribs:** Sore and aching
- **Foot:** Stiff
- **Overall capacity:** "One thing at a time"

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Whoop Recovery:** 45% (low - body stressed from week)
- Body telling me to manage expectations today

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **Action Network meeting + Gold Coast client visit - be fully present** → Rock #2 (MRR/business relationships), P3 (protecting clients from cyber threats)
   - Morning: Action Network breakfast
   - All day: Gold Coast client visit (relationship building + service delivery)
   - Afternoon: KBN Christmas function
   - Long day ahead - presence matters more than perfection

2. **EAT LUNCH - NON-NEGOTIABLE** → Energy management + operational readiness
   - Two days skipped lunch → low energy spirals
   - Body at 45% recovery already needs fuel
   - One thing at a time capacity = must fuel properly
   - This is not optional

3. **BNI prep + ice bath tonight after KBN** → Rock #4 (ice bath 90%+) + responsibility to BNI chapter
   - **BNI prep MUST be done tonight:** Friday 6:30 AM meeting, no option to do it morning
   - **Ice bath:** 7/9 days (77.8%), 5 misses remaining - cannot afford to skip
   - Full day ahead but committed to responsibilities
   - Plan: BNI prep + ice bath both happen after KBN function

**Intention for the day:**
"One thing at a time. Present and disciplined."

This is a full day but I've committed to my responsibilities. BNI prep happens tonight - period. Ice bath happens tonight - period. Everything else gets my full presence in the moment.

**Morning moment:**
Kristyn brought me coffee in bed this morning. Yesterday we argued. Last night she cooked dinner. This morning - coffee in bed before my marathon day. That's 25 years. That's partnership.

**Notes:**
- Full day: Action Network → Gold Coast client (all day) → KBN Christmas function → BNI prep → Ice bath
- Capacity is "one thing at a time" - acknowledge this, work with it
- 45% Whoop recovery - body needs fuel and rest between activities
- Ribs sore, foot stiff - manage pain, don't push through stupidly
- BNI is 6:30 AM Friday - no wiggle room on prep tonight

**Potential obstacles:**
- **Long day fatigue:** Plan = eat lunch, stay present, don't try to multitask
- **Skipping BNI prep temptation:** Not an option - I have responsibility as VP
- **Skipping ice bath temptation:** Not an option - only 5 misses left, pattern must hold
- **Travel time eating schedule:** Pack food if needed for Gold Coast client visit

**Confidence level:** 7/10 - Challenging day ahead but commitments are clear and I'm disciplined enough to follow through

- **What drained me:** 7+ hours total driving, tinnitus was loud this morning, long fasting window
- **What energized me:** BNI presentation success, Farm Angels client happiness, Kristyn making dinner, making love in morning, customers calling office (delegation win), making it home safe, Kristyn being strong and sexy

**Tomorrow Preview:**
- Saturday ahead
- Will listen to "The Way of the Superior Man" with Kristyn during drive
- Recovery from back-to-back marathon days (Thursday + Friday)
- Protect ice bath routine - only 4 misses remaining, margin very tight

**Gratitude:**

I'm grateful for this Friday. It was a pretty good day. BNI went well because I stayed sober Thursday to be sharp. The Chinchilla trip was 7+ hours but the clients were so happy - that's why I do this work. Customers are calling the office instead of me constantly - that's the systems working finally.

I'm grateful I made it home safe through that spectacular lightning storm. I'm grateful Kristyn handled the hail alone and kept our cars safe - she is strong when needed, and I love her for that.

I'm grateful for the morning - making love instead of eating breakfast was a good memory, a good choice. And I'm grateful she made her dad's satay curry when I got home late, and that she was being sexy and wearing something revealing. After 25+ years, she still shows up like that. That's everything.

I'm grateful for the mindset shift today - recognizing that my life is not the hardest thing in the world, that I am happy and content. The small frustrations aren't worth dwelling on. This is what all the work is for - these days where I notice I'm actually doing well, actually happy, actually building the life I want.

The ice bath miss stings - only 4 misses left for the quarter now - but the gym was closed. I'll get back to it tomorrow. The pattern is still holding: no ice bath but still no drinking. That's progress too.

### Friday, November 14, 2025 - Day 11 of Q1

**MARATHON TRAVEL DAY**

**Energy Level:** 6/10
**Mood:** Moderate energy, determined despite challenges
**Woke:** 8:30am (late after Thursday marathon day)

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Whoop Recovery:** 65% (yellow - body not fully recharged)
- **Note:** Thursday was extreme - got home very late, too tired for evening reflection

**Physical State:**
- **Body:** Feels GOOD physically
- **Tinnitus:** LOUD this morning (ringing bad)
- **Pain:** Standard (leg, ribs, arm)
- **Overall:** Body good, ears bad - the P1 mission context (pain that drives drinking habit)

**Breakfast:**
- NONE - Fasting until at least 11am
- **Context:** 6+ hour drive today (3h each way to Chinchilla)
- Long gap given marathon day ahead

**Yesterday Context (Thursday Nov 13):**
- **MARATHON DAY:** BNI presentation 6:30am → Action Network meeting → Gold Coast client all day → KBN party → got home very late
- **BIG WIN:** NO DRINKING at KBN party despite long day and being hungry
- **Ice bath:** ❌ MISSED - Gym was closed before he finished work (marathon day ended too late)
- Too tired for evening reflection - did it Friday morning instead

**Q1 Ice Bath Tracking - CRITICAL STATUS:**
- **Current:** 7/11 days = 63.6% (DOWN from 70%)
- **Target:** 90%+ = 81+ days out of 90
- **Misses used:** 4/9 allowed
- **Misses remaining:** 5 for next 79 days
- **Status:** 🟡 YELLOW - Getting tight, need to protect this

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **BNI breakfast 6:30am presentation** → Rock #1 (hiring connections), Rock #2 (MRR/business relationships), P2 (integrity in business)
   - Already completed before morning ritual
   - VP role - setting culture standard
   - Mission-aligned networking

2. **3-hour drive to Chinchilla → client work → 3-hour drive home** → Rock #2 (MRR), P3 (protecting businesses from cyber threats)
   - Fix internet for Chinchilla client (service excellence)
   - 6+ hours total driving = limited productive work time
   - Client service is main deliverable
   - Travel day reality: most of day is windshield time

3. **Protect ice bath tonight despite late return - CRITICAL** → Rock #4 (ice bath 90%+ consistency)
   - Only 5 misses remaining for 79 days left
   - Thursday miss understandable (gym closed after marathon day) but Rock #4 getting tight
   - Cannot afford another miss
   - Pattern proven: ice bath → no drinking → quality time with Kristyn
   - Late return makes this challenging but non-negotiable

**Additional Context:**
- **TruPeer action item:** Get Kristyn access to TruPeer portal + attend TruPeer calls together
  - Building partnership in business growth strategy
  - Not time-sensitive today but capture for follow-up

**Intention for the day:**
**"Be fully present in service and fully present when I get home - despite the long drive, the tinnitus, and the fatigue."**

This is a travel day. Most of my time is driving. But when I'm with the client, I'm 100% there fixing their problem. And when I get home late tonight, I don't bring exhaustion and frustration through the door - I do the ice bath, I show up for Kristyn, I protect the pattern that's working. The tinnitus is loud, the fasting is long, the drive is brutal - none of that is an excuse to break what I'm building.

**Potential obstacles & response plans:**

**Obstacle 1: Tinnitus is LOUD this morning**
- **Response:** This is P1 mission context - the pain that drives drinking. Acknowledge it, manage it, don't let it dictate the day. Ice bath tonight helps reset.

**Obstacle 2: Fasting until 11am with 6+ hour drive**
- **Response:** Long gap given marathon day ahead. Pack food for Chinchilla? Or eat substantial meal at 11am to fuel the drive back?

**Obstacle 3: Late return home + ice bath**
- **Response:** Non-negotiable. Only 5 misses left for quarter. Pattern working: ice bath → no drinking → better with Kristyn. Plan gym time before driving home or immediately when arriving home.

**Obstacle 4: Travel day = temptation to skip lunch/fuel**
- **Response:** Pattern from this week - skip lunch → low energy spiral. Must eat even on road. Client service requires energy.

**Notes:**
- Thursday marathon day: 6:30am BNI → Action Network → Gold Coast all day → KBN party → home very late
- Thursday BIG WIN: NO DRINKING at KBN party (despite long day, hungry, social pressure)
- This is back-to-back marathon days - Friday is recovery while working
- Ice bath miss Thursday was circumstantial (gym closed after marathon day ended too late)
- Body feels good physically despite moderate energy (65% Whoop recovery)
- Tinnitus adds extra challenge layer today

**Confidence level:** 6/10 - Realistic about challenging day (travel, tinnitus, fasting, late return) but committed to service and protecting ice bath routine

### Saturday, November 15, 2025 - Day 12 of Q1

**POTTSVILLE WEEKEND - KRISTYN'S ROTARY TRAINING**

**Energy Level:** 7/10
**Mood:** Feeling good - beautiful morning start with my wife
**Woke:** Early from sunrise + animal sounds (crows, birds, etc.)

**Sleep Quality:**
- **Whoop Data:** 6.7 hours sleep (95.6% efficiency - excellent)
- **Recovery:** 47% (yellow zone - needs more total hours)
- **Sleep Breakdown:**
  - Deep sleep: 1.7 hours (good)
  - REM sleep: 2.0 hours (good)
  - Light sleep: adequate
- **Analysis:** Great sleep efficiency and quality stages, but body needs more total hours for full recovery
- **Sunrise wake:** Early wake from sunlight + animal sounds (crows, birds calling)
- **Sleep plan:** Discussed eye masks and earplugs with Kristyn to help sleep through sunrise and animal noise

**Morning Start (Beautiful):**
- Made love to Kristyn this morning
- Brought her tea in bed
- She's lying next to me on iPad doing puzzles
- This is what life is supposed to feel like

**Physical State:**
- **Energy:** Feeling good but tired from yesterday's long drive to Pottsville
- **Body:** Normal aches present
- **Pain level:** Standard (leg, ribs, arm)
- **Tinnitus:** 24/7 as always

**Weekend Context:**
- **Location:** Pottsville, North NSW (beachside town south of Gold Coast)
- **Why here:** Kristyn's Rotary District President training weekend
- **Today:** Kristyn at training all day (first time as President-elect, excited and nervous)
- **Tomorrow:** Rotary AGM (Annual General Meeting)
- **Travel:** Drove Mustang down yesterday (long drive, hence tiredness)

**Kristyn's State:**
- Excited about Rotary President training
- A bit nervous (first time in this leadership role)
- This is important to her - becoming club president next year
- I'm here to support without influencing

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **Support Kristyn through Rotary training (without influencing)** → Relationship priority, partnership, her leadership development
   - Drop her at training
   - Pick her up when finished
   - Success metric: She talks about what she learned/experienced when I pick her up
   - My role: Be present, listen, support - don't try to fix or guide
   - Her journey, not mine

2. **Find waterfall/creek near Murwillumbah for cold mountain water swim** → Rock #4 (cold exposure 90%+ days), body reset, adventure
   - Can't do ice bath on the road (no gym access)
   - Cold mountain water swim counts as cold exposure
   - Resets body after long drive yesterday
   - Nature, adventure, presence
   - Near Murwillumbah (inland from Pottsville)
   - Scout location while Kristyn at training

3. **Celebratory evening with Kristyn** → Relationship priority, partnership, celebration
   - Nice dinner together (she's worked hard in training all day)
   - Maybe live music somewhere
   - Controlled drinks if we choose (conscious choice, not habit)
   - Good sleep boundary (don't stay out too late - AGM tomorrow morning)
   - Quality time together celebrating her training completion

**Intention for the day:**
**"Ignore time and not be in a rush. Notice small things on the travel. It will be a good day. Taking the Mustang - nothing better than a v8 and a pretty wife."**

This is about presence. Slowing down. Noticing details. The sound of the Mustang. The scenery between Pottsville and Murwillumbah. The cold mountain water. The look on Kristyn's face when she talks about her training. The dinner together. The music if we find it. Not rushing. Not checking phone constantly. Not being somewhere else mentally. Here. Now. With her. In this beautiful place.

**Notes:**
- **Rock #4 plan:** Cold mountain water swim counts as cold exposure (can't ice bath on road)
- **Mustang road trip:** V8 soundtrack, pretty wife, scenic drive - exactly what life's about
- **Kristyn's first President training:** Huge milestone for her leadership development
- **Weekend timing:** Today training, tonight celebration, tomorrow AGM
- **Location scouting:** Murwillumbah waterfalls/creeks = cold mountain water
- **Sleep discussion:** Eye masks and earplugs to help both of us sleep through sunrise + animal sounds

**Potential obstacles & response plans:**

**Obstacle 1: Temptation to "help" Kristyn with Rotary training**
- **Response:** This is HER journey. My role is support, not influence. Listen when she shares, don't solve or guide. She's capable - let her discover her own leadership style.

**Obstacle 2: Can't find good waterfall/creek for cold water swim**
- **Response:** Research while Kristyn at training. Ask locals. Use maps. Murwillumbah area has mountain streams - they exist, just need to find one accessible.

**Obstacle 3: Celebratory drinking could spiral (pattern risk)**
- **Response:** Conscious choice, controlled amount, food first, good sleep boundary. This isn't nightly habit (what we're breaking), this is celebration with wife. Know the difference.

**Obstacle 4: Tiredness from yesterday's long drive**
- **Response:** Already feeling good despite tired. Cold water swim will reset body. Don't overschedule today - the plan is simple: drop Kristyn, find creek, swim, pick up Kristyn, dinner, celebrate. That's enough.

**Confidence level:** 8/10 - Beautiful morning start, clear intention, simple plan, quality time with Kristyn, adventure and presence. This is what the work is for - these weekends.

**Gratitude:**

I'm grateful for this day with Kristyn. From singing in the Mustang on the drive to making love before sleep, this is what all the work is for - these days where I'm fully present with my wife, supporting her growth, adventuring together, celebrating controlled.

I'm grateful for the Killan Falls moment. The cold mountain water under the waterfall, sitting in peace after, the clear air and thinking time. My body needed that reset and my mind needed that clarity.

I'm grateful I didn't buy that beer at the services club. I sat there alone, easy to slip, easy to rationalize. I didn't. Just sat and thought. That's discipline becoming character.

I'm grateful for Kristyn's excitement about Rotary. Watching her eyes light up sharing what she learned, seeing her step into leadership. She's nervous and excited and growing. I'm proud of her.

I'm grateful for controlled evening drinking - one wine each, shared duck, walking home in the rain. This is celebration with wife, not nightly habit. I know the difference now.

I'm grateful for the dress she bought that looks fantastic on her. Grateful for soaking our feet in that clear creek together. Grateful for the strawberry dessert we shared. Grateful for her hand in mine walking back through the rain.

This is the life I'm building. Not perfect (should have skipped the fried food), but present, intentional, connected. Today I was the husband she deserves. That matters more than anything.

- **HRV:** 52.7 (solid)
- **Resting HR:** 67 bpm
- **Sleep Performance:** 82%
- **Hours in bed:** 8.5 hours
- **Sleep efficiency:** 96% (excellent)
- **Analysis:** The 2-drink discipline showed in recovery data - body recovered well from Saturday's controlled celebration

**Morning Context:**
- Still in Pottsville (beachside town)
- NSW daylight saving putting them up earlier than usual
- About to walk to beach with Kristyn
- Then cafe breakfast
- Then Rotary AGM (where Kristyn had her training yesterday)
- Driving home to Brisbane after AGM

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **Ocean swim at beach during morning walk with Kristyn** → Rock #4 (cold exposure 90%+ days)
   - Currently 8/13 days (61.5%) - building back toward 90% target
   - Yesterday: Killan Falls waterfall (counted as cold exposure)
   - Today: Ocean swim opportunity during beach walk
   - Natural cold exposure work while enjoying Pottsville before leaving
   - Walking there anyway - stack the win

2. **Support Kristyn at Rotary AGM** → Relationship priority, her leadership journey
   - She was VERY excited after training yesterday
   - Today she's President-elect at the AGM
   - My role: be present, be proud, listen to her experience
   - Same approach as yesterday: support without influencing
   - This is her leadership growth - I'm the supportive husband

3. **Drive home safely + Weekly Review tonight (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** → Telos system integrity, Q1 accountability, Week 2 closure
   - This is Week 2 (Nov 11-17) ending
   - Weekly review is THE most important practice in entire Telos system
   - 6 full days of journal entries this week to analyze
   - Three persona feedback waiting (Supportive Coach, Balanced Advisor, Brutal Truth-Teller)
   - Where daily data becomes wisdom
   - Must happen tonight after getting home and settled

**Intention for the day:**
"Be present for the last moments in Pottsville, be the supportive husband at her AGM, and honor the weekly review tonight - because the learning loop is what makes all of this work."

**Breakfast Plan:**
- Cafe breakfast after beach walk with Kristyn
- Eating together before AGM
- No fasting today - fueling for drive home

**Notes:**

- 81% Whoop recovery = proof that 2-drink discipline works
- Daylight saving time difference (NSW vs QLD)

**Potential obstacles & response plans:**

**Obstacle 1: Skip ocean swim because "we're just walking"**
- **Response:** This IS the priority. 8/13 days Rock #4 needs every win. Ocean swim is natural cold exposure, and you're walking to the beach anyway. Do it intentionally.

**Obstacle 2: Too tired from Pottsville weekend to do weekly review tonight**
- **Response:** Non-negotiable. This is the learning loop that makes everything else work. Even 30 minutes tonight is better than skipping it. Week 2 journal entries are rich with data.

**Obstacle 3: Long drive home after AGM**
- **Response:** Drive safely. Kristyn is with you. V8 Mustang, good roads, get home safely. The weekly review happens tonight regardless of tiredness.

**Confidence level:** 8/10 - Rested, recovered (81% Whoop), clear priorities, beautiful morning with Kristyn, supporting her leadership day, ocean swim planned, weekly review scheduled tonight

- Ricky = Not tied to online club, could leave
- Solution: Both can be in 2 clubs (online for her presidency, physical for him)
- Partnership decision-making
- Supporting her leadership without sacrificing his preferences
- Compromise that serves both

**5. WEEKEND MEAL PREP:**
- Did meal prep for the week ahead
- Low carb focus (protein + green vegetables)
- Setting up for success
- Not leaving nutrition to chance
- Preparation prevents poor food choices (learning from pizza/fried food mistake Saturday)

**Family Moments:**

**KRISTYN - BEAUTIFUL DAY TOGETHER:**

*Wild Thyme Cafe Discovery:*

- Huge portions
- She loved the slow cooked pork
- Excellent coffee

- QUT AI/Robotics masters going well

**PARKER:**
- Texted pictures from weekend trip

- Connection maintained even when busy
- Proud of how he manages work/study balance
- Melbourne life with Liam

**Energy Patterns:**
- **Started day:** 7/10 (81% Whoop recovery from controlled Saturday)
- **Ended day:** 8/10 (good day, content, aching leg but overall positive)
- **What drained me:** Aching leg in evening (13 bolts + plate), traffic between Gold Coast and Brisbane, normal tiredness after active weekend
- **What energized me:** Ocean swim in rainy morning (small effort = big reward), Wild Thyme cafe discovery with Kristyn, scenic Mustang drive through hills, double cold exposure (ocean + ice bath), not doing any work (quality time priority), texting pictures to boys, Kristyn cleaning up so he could sleep

**Tomorrow Preview:**
- Back to work week (Monday)
- Low carb meal prep ready to go
- Continue ice bath routine (9/14 days, building momentum)
- Morning ritual to set priorities
- **WEEKLY REVIEW - NON-NEGOTIABLE** (Week 2: Nov 11-17)
  - This is THE most important practice
  - 6 full days of rich journal entries this week
  - Where daily data becomes wisdom

**Gratitude:**

I'm grateful for the ocean swim this morning. Rainy, could have skipped it, but that little effort in bad conditions left me feeling good all day. That's what discipline looks like - showing up anyway.

I'm grateful for Wild Thyme cafe and watching Kristyn enjoy her slow cooked pork. For the scenic drive through the hills with country music loud and her beside me. For the Mustang soundtrack on those pretty country roads she loves.

I'm grateful we solved the Rotary club dilemma together. She's president next year, she can't leave, but I can be in 2 clubs. Partnership. Compromise. Supporting her leadership without losing what I want.

I'm grateful I didn't do any work today. No clients, no tasks, no obligations. Just Kristyn and me. That's what weekends are supposed to be.

I'm grateful for the double cold exposure - ocean swim AND ice bath. Building the routine back up. 9/14 days now, momentum returning.

I'm grateful for falling asleep on the couch after dinner and Kristyn cleaning up so I could rest. That's 25 years of partnership in one small act.

I'm grateful my leg is just aching, not broken again. The 13 bolts hold. The pain reminds me of service. The discomfort is manageable.

I'm grateful for this weekend with my wife - her Rotary training, the waterfall, the markets, the cafe discoveries, the drives, the talking, the connection. This is the life I'm building, and it's good.

- **HRV:** 48.6 ms
- **Resting HR:** 64 bpm
- **Deep sleep:** 1.74 hours

- **Body:** Feeling strong and ready for workout
- **Recovery:** 74% Whoop green zone shows body recharged well
- **Pain:** Standard (leg, ribs, arm) - manageable

**Breakfast/Supplements:**
- [To be added]

**Week 2 Context (Nov 11-17):**
- Completed weekly review with three persona analyses
- Rock #4 at 61.5% (8/13 days) - CRITICAL to get back on track
- Leaving behind: Frustrations and skipping lunch
- Carrying forward: Alcohol discipline and lower carb diet
- Week 2 insight: Ice bath pattern is KEY to everything working

**Q1 Ice Bath Tracking - CRITICAL STATUS:**
- **Current:** 8/13 days = 61.5% (Week 2 completion: 57.1%, 4/7 days)
- **Target:** 90%+ = 81+ days out of 90
- **Misses used:** 5/9 allowed (only 4 misses remaining for 76 days)
- **Week 3 requirement:** NEED 7/7 days this week to hit 94.8%
- **Status:** 🟡 YELLOW - Every day matters, no more misses allowed

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **Workout + Ice bath** → Rock #4 (ice bath 90%+ consistency)
   - CRITICAL: Need 7/7 this week for 94.8% going forward
   - Only 4 misses remaining for entire quarter
   - Pattern proven: ice bath → no drinking → quality time with Kristyn → better sleep
   - 9/10 energy level = perfect conditions for strong session
   - 4-5 minutes protocol (reduced from 3-10 min per medical advice for cardiovascular load)

2. **Bundaberg job prep + quoting** → P2 (integrity in business), P3 (protecting clients from cyber threats)
   - Service excellence preparation
   - Proper quoting = integrity in business
   - Mission work: protecting businesses from threats they can't defend against
   - Tomorrow's client work starts with today's preparation
   - This is what Venturer Technology stands for

3. **EAT LUNCH** → Self-care commitment, stop self-sacrifice pattern
   - Week 2 pattern: Skipping lunch = low energy spiral → poor evening decisions
   - Week 3 commitment from review: Eat lunch every single day
   - This is not optional - it's foundation for everything else working
   - Self-sacrifice pattern stops here
   - Fuel the machine properly

**Additional Context:**
- **Maddy conversation:** Scheduled for Wednesday (Week 3 commitment honored)
  - Will be sit-down conversation with Dean present
  - Following Dean's calm approach: give notice but fair
  - Advertising for replacement already started (per Dean's advice)
  - P1 mission context: She fits mission profile but reliability threatens business scalability

**Intention for the day:**
**"Clear head and allow time to complete things to prepare for tomorrow."**

Focus, not rushing. Proper preparation. Quality over speed. This is what Week 3 looks like - coming off the insights from three persona analyses. The Brutal Truth-Teller called out the excuses. The Supportive Coach celebrated the wins. The Balanced Advisor gave practical steps. Now execute.

Clear head = workout + ice bath done first
Allow time = don't rush through prep work
Complete things = finish what you start, don't leave loose ends
Prepare for tomorrow = Bundaberg quoting done RIGHT

**Potential obstacles & response plans:**

**Obstacle 1: High energy → temptation to overcomplicate**
- **Response:** Stick to the 3 priorities. Don't add more just because energy is high. Quality execution beats quantity every time.

**Obstacle 2: Getting into work flow → forget lunch**
- **Response:** Set reminder. Lunch is NON-NEGOTIABLE this week. Week 2 pattern proved this matters. Stop the self-sacrifice.

**Obstacle 3: Bundaberg prep → perfectionism spiral**
- **Response:** Good enough IS good enough. Service with integrity, not paralysis by analysis. Quote it, prep it, move on.

**Notes:**
- Week 3 begins with 9/10 energy - best start possible
- 74% Whoop recovery shows body responding well to discipline
- Rock #4 needs perfect week - every ice bath matters
- Coming off beautiful Pottsville weekend with Kristyn (Rotary training, waterfall, cafe discoveries)
- Lower carb diet experiment continuing from Sunday
- Alcohol discipline solid - Saturday's controlled celebration showed maturity
- Week 2 weekly review completed with all three personas - insights captured

- Bundaberg work continues
- Maddy conversation Wednesday approaching
- Keep lunch commitment going

**Confidence level:** 9/10 - High energy, clear priorities, strong foundation from Week 2 review. Today is about execution, not figuring things out.

- Body recovered well from massive travel day

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **Have conversation with Maddy** → Rock #1 (Hire mission-aligned staff)

   - Maddy fits P1 mission (partner of veteran, DV father, housing commission background)
   - Recent unreliability issues need to be addressed

   - **Critical:** This conversation determines hiring urgency and staffing gap reality

2. **Talk to Dean about pricing** → Rock #2 (Increase MRR) + leadership development
   - Let Dean have more input - empowerment/delegation
   - Dean = Navy vet, Core Computers manager, calm advisor
   - This is about growing Dean's ownership and decision-making
   - Supports both revenue growth and developing his leadership

3. **Prepare for Annaley meeting tomorrow (Thursday Nov 20)** → Rock #2 (Revenue/client relationship)
   - Annaley = founder of BIGGEST client
   - Critical business relationship

**Potential obstacles:**
- **Maddy conversation uncertainty:** Go in prepared, compassionate but clear about expectations
- **Foot pain:** Don't let it affect presence or energy - manage as normal
- **Energy crash from yesterday:** 9/10 now but watch for afternoon dip after travel recovery
- **Preparation time for Annaley:** Don't let day-to-day fires steal prep time - this is critical

- **Current:** 10/15 days (66.7%) through Tuesday Nov 18
- **Target:** 81+ days out of 90 (90%+ consistency)
- **Misses used:** 5/9 allowed
- **Status:** Back on track - yesterday's completion after 8-hour drive proves commitment

5. **Bedtime ritual with Kristyn** - Kiss, I love you, good night (the anchor held despite exhaustion)

**Struggles/Frustrations:**
- **Maddy situation:** Cost the afternoon, felt terrible watching her leave crying, nowhere safe to go
- **Bvoip deployment:** Tech disappointment, wasted time
- **Sam's breaks:** Getting out of control, need to address
- **Under-eating pattern:** Skipped lunch again, didn't fuel properly for workload
- **Nearly lashed out at Kristyn:** Multiple times caught myself about to snap from frustrations - she was in good mood (Salvation Army lunch), I was exhausted/hangry/stressed
- **Ice bath miss:** Too late, too exhausted (Day 18 miss drops to 61.1%)

**What made it hard:**
- Long day, no food for 10+ hours, emotional labor with Maddy, tech frustrations, exhaustion from overtraining pattern
- Friday wine habit + stress = strong urge to buy bottle (fought it successfully)
- Nearly snapping at Kristyn because of the day's frustrations when she'd done nothing wrong

**Learning/Action:**
- **CRITICAL INSIGHT:** "The not drinking is helping. Some breath work would help."
  - Not drinking is helping emotional regulation (seeing the connection now)
  - Breath work as circuit breaker when overwhelmed = concrete strategy
  - **I KNOW HOW:** Already do box breathing sometimes, even did Wim Hof breath work session
  - **THE OPPORTUNITY:** Make it systematic routine, not ad hoc - BEFORE engaging with Kristyn when overflow building
  - **Next Action:** Implement breath work as systematic circuit breaker: When stress/frustration building → 2-3 min box breathing → THEN engage
- Lunch is non-negotiable - this skip pattern is feeding exhaustion and emotional dysregulation
- Need to address Sam's break situation before it becomes bigger problem
- Bedtime ritual is the anchor - even exhausted, nearly lashing out, caught it and protected what matters

**Thoughts & Ideas:**
- Not drinking is genuinely helping regulate emotions - can see it working now
- **Breath work strategy is clear:** I have the tools (box breathing, Wim Hof experience) - need to make it routine/systematic, not just something I do occasionally
- **The pattern to break:** Stress builds → about to lash out → catch it → nearly damage relationship. NEW pattern: Stress builds → breath work circuit breaker → regulated → engage safely
- The mission work (Maddy crisis) costs productivity but proves integrity
- Dean and Ethan being flat out (positive) while I'm handling crises - good sign of business health
- Friday wine pattern is habitual, not need-based - resisting it successfully shows growth

**Family Moments:**

**KRISTYN:**
- Breakfast burger together (needed the connection and fuel)
- Her PT session is going fantastic - body firming up, she's really enjoying gym work, so proud of her
- Prepping for Sunday party while I cooked dinner (late, both exhausted)
- Nearly lashed out at her multiple times from day's frustrations but caught myself - she was in good mood from Salvation Army lunch
- **Bedtime ritual held:** Kiss, I love you, good night - the anchor that mattered most today
- Even exhausted and frustrated, I protected what mattered - didn't let the day's stress damage us

**RONIN:**
- (Not home today - at uni/Brisbane)

**PARKER:**
- (Not home today - Melbourne)

**Energy Patterns:**
- Started day: 7/10 (fatigued but good capacity)
- Ended day: 3/10 (exhausted, emotionally drained, nearly broke)
- What drained me: Maddy crisis (emotional labor), no food 10+ hours, tech frustrations, late night, resisting wine urge
- What energized me: BNI networking enjoyment, Pia training success, Kristyn's PT progress

**Tomorrow Preview:**
- SATURDAY - rest and recovery needed
- Process the week's patterns (ice bath miss, lunch skips, under-eating)
- Quality time with Kristyn
- Consider breath work practice setup

**Gratitude:**
I didn't buy the wine. I caught myself before lashing out at Kristyn. I chose humanity with Maddy over productivity. The bedtime ritual held even when I was nearly broken. That's the mission working - protecting what matters most when everything else is falling apart. And Kristyn's strength and patience with me when I'm struggling.

### Saturday, November 22, 2025

**Morning Ritual (7:06 AM)**

**Energy Level:** GOOD
**Mood:** Grateful for extra sleep, present with Kristyn
**Sleep:** 6:00 AM wake (vs usual 4-4:30 AM) - extra 1.5 hours, deep quality sleep (arms numb from sleeping on them)
**Recovering from:** Friday's brutality (49% Whoop recovery)

**Morning Connection:**
- Made Kristyn tea ✓
- Garden time together ✓
- Back to bed for tea/coffee, talking while writing this ✓

**Calendar Events Today:**
- Morning: RSL club working bee (veteran community service)
- Mid-day: Reporting work
- Afternoon: Christmas lunch with friends
- Evening: Christmas party with client
- **Reality check:** Will drink but not to excess, home for good sleep (tomorrow = Gold Coast drive)

**Tomorrow Context:**
- Peter OLD's 50th Rotary anniversary (Kristyn spent lots of time organizing)
- Help set up, step back so she can shine
- Board shorts + black tie as joke (Rotary tradition commentary)

**Top 3 Priorities Today:**

1. **RSL Working Bee - Show Up & Serve** → Serves: G1: Mission-Aligned Business Growth (P1: Veterans)
   - Veteran community service work
   - Physical work, presence, community building
   - This is the work - not just business, actual service

2. **Be Present at Community Events** → Serves: G1: Mission-Aligned Business (P1: Community)
   - Christmas lunch & client Christmas party
   - **Boundary:** Drink within boundaries, home for decent sleep
   - Tomorrow = Gold Coast drive, need to be rested

3. **Tomorrow's Setup - Help Kristyn Shine** → Serves: G6: Marriage/Family (Kristyn)
   - Peter OLD's 50th Rotary anniversary
   - Be there and happy, help set up
   - **Critical:** Step back so SHE leads (she organized this)

**Intention for the day:**

**"Enjoy and build my community. Live laugh and learn."**

**Sleep Trade-off Awareness:**
- Knows drinking will affect sleep tonight
- Accepts trade-off realistically (social connection matters too)
- Boundaries: not to excess, home at reasonable time
- Tomorrow matters (Gold Coast drive, support Kristyn)

**Potential obstacles:**
- **Drinking too much at events:** Response - set clear boundary (couple drinks max, social only, home at reasonable time)
- **Getting sucked into work instead of community:** Response - this is a rest/recovery day, work is secondary to presence
- **Tired from Friday's brutality:** Response - already got extra sleep, pace myself, honor what body needs

**Confidence level:** 8/10 - clear on priorities, boundaries set, energy is good, realistic about trade-offs
