## Childhood & Formative Years

### Growing Up in Mackay (1976-1993)

**Household:**
- Father: Physically abusive, beat us for minor things

- Younger brother: Michael (born ~1982, 6 years younger) - no real relationship due to age gap

**Parents' Focus:**

- Owned their home
- Focused on saving money rather than experiences or holidays
- Life dictated by TV schedules - couldn't do anything if a favorite program was on
- Rigid, controlled environment

### The Safe Harbor: Paternal Grandparents

**Both owned and worked on sugar cane farms**

**My fondest memories:**
- Going to the farm
- Time with grandfather and grandmother

- Practical, hands-on skills

**Most Important Legacy:**
- **They encouraged me to travel and experience life**
- **Told me not to be held back**
- **I model my marriage and raising of my boys on them, not my parents**

**Critical Decision:** I consciously broke the cycle of abuse. My grandparents showed me a different way.

## Current Challenges & Growth

### Drinking Habit - Actively Addressing

**The Pattern (Before):**
- Started after East Timor return
- 4-6 nights per week
- Full bottle of wine (most common)
- Never sick, never passed out, always "in control"
- **But the consistency and habit were the problem**

**Root Causes:**
- Tinnitus - helps sleep when ears won't stop ringing
- Racing brain - alcohol stops mind running so fast
- Self-medication for trauma + pain + no peace

**Current Status (Last Few Weeks):**
- **Ice baths at gym every night** - 3-10 minutes at 4°C in professional ice bath
- **This has helped a lot**
- Now drinking only on social occasions, in moderation
- Going home when it's time
- **Still crave a drink every night** (underlying issues haven't changed)

**My Approach:**
- Learn to control the problem, not just replace it
- Not trading one addiction for another
- Finding healthy coping mechanisms

### Physical Limitations

**Current Reality:**
- Constant pain
- Tinnitus never stops
- Limited range of motion
- But still working out, running businesses, serving community

**Approach:**
- Work within limitations
- Find adaptations (ice baths instead of alcohol)
- Keep showing up despite the pain

## Values & Beliefs Forged Through Experience

### From My Grandparents

- Service above self
- Travel and experience life
- Don't be held back
- Practical skills and hard work

### From East Timor

- Protection of the vulnerable is sacred
- Power and greed destroy people
- Witness creates responsibility

### From Being Abandoned

- If the system won't help people, I will
- Opportunity should not depend on having a perfect body
- Everyone deserves a second chance

### From Being a Father

- Break the cycle - be different than what was done to you
- Support your children being who they are (Parker's courage)
- Give them opportunities, not limitations (Nudgee sacrifice)

### From Kristyn

- Partnership through everything
- Never leaving when it gets hard
- Building together

## What Drives Me Forward

Despite:
- Constant physical pain
- Tinnitus that gives no peace
- Recent loss of Sabre
- Working to break drinking habit
- Injuries that limit what I can do

I keep going because:
- **People like Peter need opportunities**
- **Veterans need support the Army won't give**
- **Charities need protection and service**
- **My boys need to see what resilience looks like**
- **Kristyn deserves a partner who shows up**
- **My grandparents' legacy demands I don't be held back**

The systems failed me. I didn't fail. And I'm making damn sure they don't fail the people who come after me.

## Future Aspirations

If I won the lottery tomorrow:
- **Still run the business** (it helps people - that won't change)
- **Travel extensively** - experience cultures, people, what it feels like to be in new places
- Not interested in cities - interested in PEOPLE
- **Rebuild a boat** to travel in
- More adventure, more freedom
- Living, not just enduring

My grandparents told me: don't be held back.
I'm still working on that part.
