# Mission

*Last Updated: 2025-11-04*

## What This Is

My mission is my response to the problems I care about solving. It's my life's work - the thing I'm here to do. This is Version 1.0, and it will evolve as I grow.

---

## Primary Mission Statement

**Version 1.0** (2025-11-04)

**"I exist to protect and serve people who've been failed, broken, or exploited by systems that should have helped them - by proving every single day that integrity, service, and disability don't stop you from building something powerful."**

---

## Who I Am (Context for the Mission)

The Army broke my body:
- 3 spiral fractures in my right leg (13 bolts and a plate still in there)
- 2 spiral rib fractures that don't line up
- Snapped left arm that doesn't bend right
- Extreme tinnitus that gives me no peace
- Time in a wheelchair that was extremely depressing

Then they abandoned me:
- "Lost" my medical files
- No retraining support
- Discharged on crutches to figure it out myself

**I rebuilt.** From wheelchair to IT certifications to running one of Brisbane's largest MSPs.

**I am living proof that the system can fail you and you can still win.**

---

## How I Execute This Mission

### 1. Hire the People the System Discards

**Who:**
- Veterans the military abandoned (because I was one)
- People with recognized disabilities (because I am one)
- People needing escape routes from domestic violence or life crises (because I know what it's like to need a way out)

**Why:**
My first employee was Peter - lost use of his legs and most of his left arm to cancer. I didn't hire him out of charity. **I hired him because I'd been in a wheelchair too.** I understood what he needed: an opportunity, not pity.

**Mission Link:**
- Serves Problem 1: People being left behind by systems
- Proves that people the system discards can thrive with opportunity

### 2. Protect the Vulnerable from Predators

**What:**
I secure businesses and charities from cyber threats using my skills:
- Firewalls
- Microsoft security products
- Network protection
- System hardening

**Why:**
East Timor showed me what people and governments do to maintain control through exploitation. Cybercriminals exploiting vulnerable businesses is the same pattern - predators targeting those who can't defend themselves.

**I cannot stand by and watch people get victimized when I have the ability to protect them.**

**Mission Link:**
- Serves Problem 3: People and businesses vulnerable to cyber threats
- Protection is a form of service to the vulnerable

### 3. Serve Charities Who Serve Others

**What:**
- Massive discounts and support to charities
- Treasurer of Clayfield Toombul Subbranch (veteran welfare)
- Kristyn and I are active Rotarians (she's club president next year)
- We host Connecting Charities (5th year, 90+ attendees) - teaching charities to run better

**Why:**
Charities do the real work in communities but often can't afford proper IT support. By protecting and serving them, I amplify their impact.

**Mission Link:**
- Serves Problem 1: Systems fail people who need help most
- Charities serve those people - if I serve charities, I serve the vulnerable

### 4. Model Integrity Over Greed

**What:**
I charge based on value delivered, not "what others charge."
I prove that service-first business can be more profitable than exploitation.

**Why:**
The IT industry is full of greed - companies charging maximum while delivering minimum. My grandparents taught me: you do the right thing because it's right, not because it's profitable.

**I'm building the alternative and proving it works.**

**Mission Link:**
- Serves Problem 2: Integrity replaced by greed in business
- Demonstrates that service-first is sustainable and profitable

### 5. Create Opportunities to Travel and Experience Life

**What:**
My grandparents taught me: don't be held back. I want to:
- Travel and experience cultures
- Feel what it's like to be in new places (people, not cities)
- Rebuild a boat for adventure

**Why:**
Not because I've earned a break - because **life is meant to be lived, not just endured.**

Despite constant pain, tinnitus, and physical limitations, I refuse to let my broken body limit my life.

**Mission Link:**
- Personal mission alignment: don't be held back
- Models for my boys that disability doesn't stop you from living fully

---

## Why This Mission Matters

**Because the Army took 10 years of my life:**
- Broke my body
- Gave me tinnitus that never stops
- Put me in a wheelchair
- Then abandoned me with no support

**Because I know what it's like:**
- To wake up every day in pain with a body that doesn't work right and still have to build a life
- To be told you're unemployable because of disability
- To need a second chance and have no one offer one

**Because I hired Peter when no one else would:**
- He's thriving
- Proving the system is wrong about who's "employable"

**Because my boys Parker and Ronin see:**
- Success isn't about comfort - it's about service, courage, and showing up even when it hurts
- Parker had the courage to be first openly gay student at Nudgee to take his boyfriend to formal
- Ronin works full-time while earning his master's in AI/robotics
- They learned this by watching Kristyn and me

**Because if Kristyn and I can build this from nothing:**
- No clients
- Broken body
- System stacked against us
- Then anyone can

**The systems failed me. I didn't fail. And I'm making damn sure they don't fail the people who come after me.**

## Mission Tests

*Questions to ensure activities align with mission*

1. **Does this serve one of my core problems?**
   - Problem 1: People left behind by systems
   - Problem 2: Integrity replaced by greed
   - Problem 3: Vulnerability to cyber threats

2. **Does this leverage my unique position?**
   - Veteran who was abandoned
   - Person with disabilities who succeeded
   - Technical skills in cybersecurity
   - Business platform that can employ others

3. **Will this create lasting impact?**
   - Not just helping one person, but proving a model works
   - Not just making money, but changing industry standards
   - Not just surviving, but showing others it's possible

4. **Would I do this even if it was difficult?**
   - If it requires working through pain - yes
   - If it requires sacrifice - yes
   - If it requires proving people wrong - absolutely yes

**If I can't answer "yes" to at least 3 of these, I need to reconsider the activity.**

## Mission Boundaries

*What is NOT part of my mission*

**I will not:**
- Exploit people for profit (that's what I'm fighting against)
- Hire based on "perfect candidates only" (that abandons the vulnerable)
- Charge "what the market will bear" without delivering value (that's greed)
- Abandon employees when they struggle (the Army did that to me)
- Let my physical limitations define what's possible (I broke that pattern already)
- Accept that the system is right about who deserves opportunities (Peter proved them wrong)

**I will delegate/ignore:**
- Activities that don't serve vulnerable people
- "Easy money" that requires compromising integrity
- Industry "best practices" that prioritize profit over service
- People who want to debate whether disabled people can succeed (I'm too busy proving it)

---

## Unique Contribution

*What makes my approach to this mission distinctive?*

**My background:**
- Military service (discipline, leadership, heavy weapons/anti-armor specialist)
- East Timor deployment (witnessed exploitation and its consequences)
- Medical discharge with no support (lived the problem I'm solving)
- Physical disabilities (13 bolts in leg, tinnitus, limited mobility)
- Time in wheelchair (understand what people with disabilities face)
- Self-taught IT transition (A+, first MCSA student)
- Underground coal mining IT (CSIRO projects, Mines Rescue, safety-critical systems)
- Business leadership (Nepean Electronics, then solo startup to major MSP)

**My perspective:**
- I'm not helping from the outside - I'm solving from the inside
- I don't pity people with disabilities - I AM one who succeeded
- I don't theorize about veteran transitions - I lived a failed one and built my own
- I don't wonder if service-first works - I'm proving it daily

**My methods:**
- Hire ONLY the people others won't (not despite their challenges, because of their potential)
- Charge based on value delivered (transparent, integrity-based pricing)
- Serve charities at cost or below (profit from commercial funds this)
- Show up despite pain (model resilience, not comfort)
- Build community (Connecting Charities, Rotary, veteran welfare)

**My combination of skills:**
- Military discipline + IT expertise + business leadership + community service + lived experience of disability + East Timor trauma awareness = unique positioning to serve veterans, people with disabilities, and vulnerable organizations

**No one else brings THIS exact combination to THIS mission.**

## Mission Evolution

**This mission will evolve.** As I grow, learn, and impact more people, my understanding will deepen.

**Review schedule:**
- **Quarterly:** Is this mission still true to who I am?
- **Annually:** What have I learned that should refine this mission?
- **After major events:** How does this experience change my understanding?

**The core will remain:**
Protect and serve people who've been failed or exploited by systems. Prove that integrity, service, and disability don't stop you from building something powerful.

**The execution will adapt:**
As Venturer grows, as technology changes, as new problems emerge, as I discover better ways to serve - the mission stays constant, the methods evolve.

---

## Living This Mission

**When I'm aligned:**
- Every employee hired serves the mission
- Every client protected amplifies impact
- Every charity supported serves the vulnerable
- Every decision traces back to problems I care about
- Every day I show up despite pain proves it's possible

**When I'm drifting:**
- Taking clients just for revenue (greed over service)
- Hiring "perfect candidates" instead of mission-aligned people
- Skipping community work because "too busy"
- Making decisions based on competitors, not values
- Letting physical limitations become excuses

**My commitment:**
Show up every day, despite constant pain and tinnitus, and prove that the systems were wrong - about veterans, about people with disabilities, about whether integrity can beat greed, about what's possible when you refuse to be held back.

**The mission isn't what I do when it's convenient. It's who I am when it's hard.**

And it's always hard. That's the point.
