# Challenges

*Last Updated: 2025-11-03*

## What This Is

Challenges are the current obstacles preventing you from achieving your goals. This file tracks what's in your way and how you're addressing it. Update this frequently - challenges change as you make progress.

**Key Principle:** Every challenge should link to a goal it's blocking, and every strategy should link to a challenge it addresses.
