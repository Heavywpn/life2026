# Strategies

*Last Updated: 2025-11-03*

## What This Is

Strategies are your specific approaches to overcome challenges and achieve goals. Each strategy should clearly link to the challenge it addresses and the goal it serves. Strategies are experiments - they can be adjusted or abandoned based on results.

**Key Principle:** Challenge → Strategy → Project → Tasks

---

## Strategy Template

For each strategy, capture:
- **ID:** S[number]
- **Addresses Challenge:** C[number]
- **Serves Goal:** G[number]
- **Status:** Testing / Working / Not Working / Paused
- **Success Metric:** How you'll know it's working
- **Review Date:** When to assess effectiveness

## Strategy Principles

*Your personal guidelines for effective strategies*

1. **Start Small:** Test with minimum viable approach
2. **Measure Early:** Track metrics from day one
3. **Time-Box:** Set review date, don't let strategies drift
4. **Kill Fast:** If not working after [X weeks], pivot
5. **Double Down:** If working, invest more resources

---

## Strategy Experiments

*Quick tests before full commitment*

**Experiment: [Name]**
- Tests strategy: S[#]
- Duration: [Timeframe]
- Hypothesis: If [action], then [result]
- Measurement: [What you'll track]
- Result: [TBD]
- Decision: [Scale up / Pivot / Abandon]

---

## Resource Allocation

*How you're distributing effort across strategies*

| Strategy | Time/Week | Money Invested | Priority |
|----------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| S1       | 5 hours   | $X             | High     |
| S2       | 2 hours   | $Y             | Medium   |

**Total commitment:** [Hours/week] and [$X/month]
