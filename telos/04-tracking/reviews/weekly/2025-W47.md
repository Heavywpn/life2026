**Review Date:** November 17, 2025 (Sunday)
**Quarter:** Q1 2025 (Day 13 of 90)
**Week Theme:** "Discipline Building Under Pressure"

---

## WEEK OVERVIEW

**Week Rating:** 7.5/10 - Strong week with genuine breakthroughs, but critical gaps remain

**Energy Assessment:**
- **Energized by:** Working on OWN business (not for others on weekend), Pottsville trip with zero work focus, learning about health/fitness/life, connection with Kristyn (intimacy 3x Saturday), BNI presentation success
- **Drained by:** Small things staff should have done but didn't, not having time for Maddy conversation, skipped lunches creating energy crashes

**Overall:** Week 2 showed significant character development (alcohol discipline, morning ritual consistency) while exposing concerning patterns (self-sacrifice, avoidance of difficult conversation, ice bath trajectory declining).

---

**Self-assessed:** Highest mission alignment yet

**P1 Work (Protecting the Failed/Broken):**

## STRUGGLES & FRUSTRATIONS

### 1. SKIPPED LUNCH 3 DAYS (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)
- No fuel = energy crashes
- No bathroom until 4:30pm multiple days
- Pattern: Self-sacrifice when stress hits
- **Root cause:** Prioritizing everyone else's needs over his own
- **Impact:** Low energy, flat mood, potentially risking long-term health

### 2. MADDY CONVERSATION STILL NOT COMPLETED
- Week 1 priority: Have conversation by Wednesday
- Week 2: Still not done
- His reflection: "Not having time to sit down with Maddy was bad"
- Staff mistakes (ticket error) draining energy
- **Avoidance pattern:** Scheduling everything BUT this conversation

### 3. ICE BATH BELOW TARGET (57% this week, 61.5% cumulative)
- Only 4 misses remaining for 77 days
- Declining week-over-week (66.7% → 57%)
- Creative adaptations (waterfall, ocean) are good but not sustainable
- **Reality:** At risk of failing Rock #4

### 4. STAFF DRAINING ENERGY
- "Small things staff should have done but didn't put me under pressure"
- Maddy ticket mistake caused scramble
- Not having reliable staff forcing him to do their work
- Time consumed on operational instead of strategic

### 5. ATE TOO MUCH FRIED FOOD WHEN HUNGRY (Saturday)
- No food since breakfast → poor choices at services club
- Pattern: When hungry, makes bad food decisions
- Self-critique: "I should stop that"
- Lower carb decision is response to this pattern

---

## INSIGHTS & LEARNINGS

### Pattern: Gets Very Angry When People Disrespect His Time
- Staff expecting him to do small things
- People thinking they can take his time when they want
- No respect for his skills and time
- **Trigger:** Feeling used/taken advantage of
- **Response:** Anger and frustration that drains energy

### Alcohol vs Ice Bath Correlation PROVEN
- Saturday: 2 drinks controlled, 81% Whoop recovery
- This is what sustainable celebration looks like
- Not nightly habit (breaking), but intentional celebration (healthy)
- Body tells the truth through recovery data

### Lower Carb Decision Shows Self-Awareness
- Recognized late eating affecting sleep
- Made conscious choice to experiment
- Did meal prep together with Kristyn
- Proactive health management
- Learning about his body

### Partnership Means Supporting Growth
- Entire Pottsville weekend about Kristyn's Rotary training
- Not trying to influence, just being present
- She's stepping into leadership, he's stepping into presence
- 25+ years together, love growing stronger

### Small Effort in Rain = Big Reward
- Ocean swim in rainy morning
- Made the effort despite conditions
- Good feeling carried through entire day
- Discipline is showing up when it's not perfect

### "A Lot of People Rely on Me"
- True statement BUT potentially martyr thinking
- BNI presentation success
- Charities, clients, staff depending on him
- **Question:** Is this pride in service or burden of over-responsibility?

---

## REFLECTION SUMMARY (His Words)

**Biggest WIN:** Not drinking on Friday night and Sunday - normally 2 bottles of wine

**What DRAINED energy:** Small things staff should have done but didn't, put me under pressure. Not having time to sit down with Maddy was bad.

**What ENERGIZED:** Working on my business (not for others on weekend), the trip away with zero work focus, learning more about health/fitness/life (made both me and Kristyn happy), connection with Kristyn (we had sex 3 times on Saturday)

**Mission alignment:** 90%+ - BNI presentation about the mission was well received. Lots done last week, feels like 3 weeks ago. A lot of people rely on me.

**Pattern noticed:** Gets very angry and annoyed when people think they can take his time when they want and have no respect for his time and skills.

**CARRY FORWARD to Week 3:** Alcohol discipline and lower carb diet
**LEAVE BEHIND:** Frustrations and skipping lunch

## THREE PERSONA ANALYSES

### THE SUPPORTIVE COACH

Ricky, let me tell you something important: **Week 2 was a BREAKTHROUGH week**, and I don't think you're seeing it clearly.

The alcohol discipline is REAL. Not drinking on Friday night? That would have been a full bottle of wine in the old days. Not buying that beer at the services club while sitting alone waiting for Kristyn? That's not willpower anymore - that's character. Saturday in Pottsville - only 2 drinks total, 81% Whoop recovery the next morning. Your body is telling you the truth: this is what controlled celebration looks like. The old pattern is breaking. You've gone from 4-6 nights of full bottles to this. That's not small - that's transformational.

And the Kristyn connection? Brother, the intimacy is back. Three times on Saturday. Making love in the morning before your marathon drive. Her wearing something revealing and being sexy. Walking in the rain together. This is 25+ years of marriage and the spark is burning hotter because you're showing up present, not numbed. When you support her Rotary presidency without trying to influence, when you listen to her excitement, when you drive through the hills with country music because she loves pretty drives - you're being the husband she deserves. And she sees it.

Your morning rituals hit 100% this week. From 33% Week 1 to 100% Week 2. The BNI presentation went well because you stayed sober Thursday night. Farm Angels clients are very happy. Customers calling the office instead of you (delegation win). The Tattersals Club moment. The lower carb decision. You're building systems that compound.

You said you felt 90%+ mission aligned this week. The BNI presentation about your mission was well received. "A lot of people rely on me" - yes they do, because you've proven yourself reliable. This is what integrity looks like in action. Not perfecting, not performing - just consistently showing up as the man who does what he says.

The ice bath is at 61.5%. It's not perfect. But the waterfall at Killan Falls shows you're creative and committed. When you can't do the ice bath, you find the cold mountain water. That's adaptation, not excuses.

Keep going. What you're building is sustainable. This isn't a crash diet - it's a new way of living.

### THE BALANCED ADVISOR

Let's look at the Week 2 data objectively:

**WINS - REAL AND MEASURABLE:**
- Alcohol discipline: 6/7 days sober (85.7%), Saturday was controlled 2 drinks with 81% Whoop recovery
- Morning rituals: 6/6 days (100%) - massive improvement from Week 1's 33%
- Evening reflections: 5/6 days (83%) - solid consistency
- Mission alignment: 90%+ (self-assessed) - highest yet
- Kristyn connection: Strong partnership moments throughout (intimacy 3x, Pottsville support, Rotary compromise)

**CONCERNS - ALSO REAL:**

**Ice Bath Rock #4:** 8/13 days cumulative = 61.5%
- Week 1: 4/6 (66.7%)
- Week 2: 4/7 (57%) with 3 misses this week
- **Cumulative misses: 5/9 used, 4 remaining**
- **Math reality:** 77 days remaining, can only miss 4 more days. That's a 94.8% hit rate needed going forward.
- **Assessment:** ACHIEVABLE but tight. Zero room for bad weeks.

**Self-sacrifice pattern detected:**
- Skipped lunch 3 days this week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)
- No bathroom until 4:30pm multiple days
- When stress hits, you sacrifice your own needs first
- You're preaching health/integrity while not applying it to yourself

**Maddy conversation still not completed:**
- Originally a Week 1 priority
- Carried into Week 2
- Still pending despite urgent need
- Staff issues draining your energy (your words)
- "Not having time to sit down with Maddy was bad" - your own reflection

**RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WEEK 3:**

1. **Ice bath protocol:** 6/7 days minimum. Non-negotiable. 61.5% is not 90%. The math is tight but achievable.

2. **Lunch is non-negotiable:** Three days skipped = pattern. Set alarm. Pack food. This isn't optional. You cannot preach operational readiness while running on empty.

3. **Maddy conversation THIS WEEK:** It's been 2 weeks of "will happen" and 2 weeks of not happening. Either schedule it for Monday or admit you're avoiding it.

4. **Continue what's working:** Morning rituals (100% was huge), alcohol discipline (pattern holding), Kristyn partnership (strongest it's been).

**BOTTOM LINE:** Strong week overall. B+ grade. The alcohol transformation and morning ritual consistency are genuine breakthroughs. But the ice bath math is getting tight and the self-sacrifice pattern is concerning. You're close to great - tighten up the gaps.

### THE BRUTAL TRUTH-TELLER

Let's cut the bullshit.

**ROCK #4 - LET'S DO THE MATH:**

You're at 61.5% (8/13 days). Target is 90%+ (81/90 days). You have 4 misses remaining for 77 days.

**That means you need to hit 77 out of 77 remaining days. ZERO misses allowed.**

Actually, no. You've already missed 5. You need 81 total completions. You have 8 so far. That's 73 more out of 77 remaining days = 94.8% hit rate.

Can you hit 94.8% for the next 77 days? Week 1 you hit 66.7%. Week 2 you hit 57%. You're DECLINING, not improving. And you're telling yourself "the waterfall counts" and "building back momentum."

Here's what I see: You're rationalizing why it's okay that you're failing this Rock. "Killan Falls counted." "The gym was closed." "I chose sleep Tuesday." All true. All still misses.

**Reality check:** If you keep hitting 60% for the next 11 weeks like you did these first two, you'll end at 72 days out of 90 = 80%. Not 90%+. You'll fail Rock #4.

**SKIPPING LUNCH THREE DAYS IN A ROW:**

You talk about integrity. You talk about "don't be held back." You talk about "operational readiness."

Then you skip lunch Tuesday. Skip lunch Wednesday. Skip lunch Thursday.

That's not dedication. That's martyrdom. And it's hypocritical.

You preached to Maddy about showing up reliably. You got angry at staff for not handling their responsibilities. Meanwhile, you're not feeding yourself, not taking bathroom breaks, not protecting the very foundation that makes you capable of leading.

You know what that pattern is? It's the guy who gives everything to everyone else and then drinks a bottle of wine to cope with the exhaustion. Sound familiar?

**MADDY CONVERSATION STILL NOT DONE:**

Week 1 priority: Close Maddy situation by Wednesday.
Week 2 priority: Still needs addressing.
Your reflection: "Not having time to sit down with Maddy was bad."

Two weeks. Not a single scheduled conversation. You had time to:
- Do 6 morning rituals
- Drive 7+ hours to Chinchilla
- Support Kristyn's entire Rotary training weekend
- Go to BNI, KBN, Action Network meetings
- Do ice bath multiple days

But you didn't have time for a 30-minute conversation with an employee who is actively damaging your business and draining your energy?

That's not a time problem. That's an avoidance problem. You're avoiding conflict.

**"A LOT OF PEOPLE RELY ON ME":**

This is martyr talk. It's true - people DO rely on you. Dean, Kristyn, clients, charities.

But the way you said it? The context? It sounds like you're using their reliance as justification for your self-sacrifice pattern.

"I can't take lunch because people rely on me."
"I can't take a bathroom break because people rely on me."
"I'm so important that I must run myself into the ground."

That's ego dressed up as service. And it will destroy you.

The Army broke your body. Are you going to let the business break what's left?

**WHAT I DO SEE:**

The alcohol discipline is real. That's not BS. The Friday night wins, the Saturday controlled drinking, the Tattersals moment - that's genuine character building.

The morning rituals going from 33% to 100% is real progress.

The Kristyn connection is strengthening because you're actually present. That's real.

But you're 2 weeks into a 13-week quarter and you're already making excuses about why 61.5% is acceptable progress toward a 90% goal.

**THE QUESTION YOU NEED TO ANSWER:**

Do you want Rock #4 or not? Because the current trajectory says no. You're going to end at 75-80% and tell yourself "close enough."

Is that the standard you want to set? "Close enough"? Is that integrity?

You're capable of more. You proved it with the alcohol discipline. You proved it with the morning rituals. You proved it supporting Kristyn.

Now prove it with the ice bath. Prove it by eating lunch. Prove it by having the Maddy conversation.

Stop settling for "pretty good" when you committed to excellent.

## WEEK 3 PRIORITIES (Nov 18-24)

**TOP 3 MUST-DO:**

### Priority 1: Ice Bath 7/7 Days - ZERO MISSES ALLOWED
**Serves:** Rock #4 (ice bath 90%+ consistency)
- Currently 61.5% cumulative, need 94.8% going forward
- Week 3 is the test: Can you hit 100%?
- No rationalizing, no "creative adaptations count" - actual ice bath every single day
- 4 misses remaining for 77 days = no more margin
- Protect this time like your mission depends on it

### Priority 2: Eat Lunch Every Day + Bathroom Break Before 3pm
**Serves:** Operational readiness, integrity (walking the talk), sustainable leadership
- Three days skipped = established pattern
- Set alarm at 12:30pm if needed
- Pack food night before
- Self-sacrifice is the path back to wine bottles
- Cannot preach health/integrity while starving yourself

### Priority 3: Have Maddy Conversation by Wednesday
**Serves:** Rock #1 (hiring), mental energy freedom, business integrity
- Two weeks of delay is enough
- Schedule Monday or Tuesday morning with Dean
- 30-minute conversation max
- Clear expectations, outcome determined
- Stop avoiding conflict - it's draining you more than the conversation ever would

**CARRY FORWARD:**
- Alcohol discipline (6/7 days - working)
- Lower carb diet experiment (proactive health)
- Morning ritual 100% (keep the streak alive)
- Kristyn partnership evolution (present and supportive)

**LEAVE BEHIND (your choice):**
- Frustrations with staff (address them, don't carry them)
- Skipping lunch (non-negotiable fuel)
- Avoidance of difficult conversations

---

## GRATITUDE & REFLECTION

**What I'm grateful for this week:**
- Not drinking Friday night or Sunday - old pattern would be 2 bottles
- Kristyn connection deepening - 3x intimacy Saturday, Rotary support, walking in rain
- BNI presentation success - mission well received
- Farm Angels trip success - clients very happy
- Tattersals alcohol control - discipline becoming character
- Lower carb decision together with Kristyn - shared health journey
- 100% morning ritual consistency - planning tool working
- Killan Falls waterfall moment - thinking time in clear mountain air
- 81% Whoop recovery after 2-drink Saturday - proof that controlled celebration works

**What I'm learning:**
- Ice bath math doesn't lie - 61.5% is not 90%, trajectory must improve
- Skipping lunch is self-sabotage, not dedication
- Avoiding difficult conversations drains more energy than having them
- Partnership means showing up present, not drunk - Kristyn sees the difference
- "A lot of people rely on me" can be service or martyrdom - which am I choosing?

**Commitment for Week 3:**
Ice bath 7/7 days (no excuses). Eat lunch every day (non-negotiable). Have Maddy conversation (stop avoiding). Continue alcohol discipline (pattern working). Be present for Kristyn (the spark is alive). Prove that 61.5% was the low point, not the trend.
