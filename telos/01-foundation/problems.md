# Problems

*Last Updated: 2026-01-01*

## What This Is

Problems are the fundamental issues in the world that you care deeply about solving. These aren't personal challenges (those go in `/03-tactical/challenges.md`), but rather the broader problems that drive your sense of purpose.

**Key Principle:** Your mission, goals, and projects should all trace back to these problems. If something doesn't serve solving one of these problems, question whether it belongs in your life.

## Identifying Your Core Problems

Ask yourself:
- What injustices make you angry?
- What suffering do you wish you could eliminate?
- What broken systems do you want to fix?
- What gaps do you see that others miss?
- What would you work on even if no one paid you?
