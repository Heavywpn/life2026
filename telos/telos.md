# TELOS: Personal Context File

## Document Purpose

This is my **Telos Context File (TCF)** - a living document that captures my essential context for personal clarity and AI collaboration. It connects my foundational problems to daily actions through a transparent, traceable chain of purpose.

**Flow:** Problems → Mission → Narratives → Goals → Challenges → Strategies → Projects → Journal

## Problems

*The fundamental problems I care about solving:*

### P1: Mission-driven organizations struggling with technology

Charities, nonprofits, and values-aligned businesses are distracted from their purpose by technology problems. They need a trusted partner who shares their values, not just a vendor.

**Why it matters:** These organizations do critical community work but get derailed by IT issues they can't solve alone.

### P2: Owner-dependent business limiting freedom

Venturer Technology currently depends heavily on me (Rick) for technical work, limiting both growth potential and personal freedom for myself and Kristyn.

**Why it matters:** We want financial security for our family and the freedom to travel and enjoy life.

### P3: Underpriced services limiting profitability

Legacy pricing ($45/seat) doesn't reflect the value delivered and prevents investment in team, systems, and growth.

**Why it matters:** Premium pricing enables hiring, profit margins, and building a sustainable business.

## Mission

*My response to these problems - my life's work*

**Primary Mission (v1.0):**

> "Empowering mission-driven organizations to focus on their purpose by providing technology leadership they can trust completely."

**How I Execute This:**

1. Premium managed services with bundled vCIO for charities, NFPs, and financial services
2. Values-driven hiring (veterans, people with disabilities, survivors)
3. Building a self-sustaining business that creates financial freedom
4. Eventually establishing a foundation for community impact

*Full mission in `/01-foundation/mission.md`*

## Values

*Core principles that guide my decisions*

### 1. Fiercely Protect Our Clients
We actively protect clients from threats. We provide honest advice even when it doesn't generate revenue. We say "no" when something isn't in their best interest.

### 2. Grow With Our Clients
We view relationships as true partnerships where their success is our success. We measure success by customer outcomes, not just tickets closed.

### 3. Community and Sacrifice Mindset
We hire team members who demonstrate community service. We actively employ veterans, people with disabilities, and survivors. We contribute to our community.
