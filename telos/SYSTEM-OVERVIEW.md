# Telos System Overview

Quick reference guide to your personal life tracking system.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Telos** = Purpose. This system helps you maintain radical clarity about your life's direction through structured self-knowledge.

**Key Principle:** Everything you do should trace back to a problem you care about solving.

**The Flow:**
```
Problems → Mission → Narratives → Goals → Challenges → Strategies → Projects → Journal
```

5. Assess challenges and strategies
6. Create monthly review in `04-tracking/reviews/monthly/`

---

## Quarterly Workflow (2-3 hours)

1. Deep dive on all goals - achieved, adjusted, or abandoned?
2. Review and update mission if evolved
3. Set next quarter's focus
4. Review all life domains
5. Update wisdom from lessons learned
6. Create quarterly review

---

## Annual Workflow (Half day)

4. Archive old version in `07-archive/old-versions/`
5. Create annual review
6. Plan next year's focus

---

## Key Practices

### The Traceability Test
Before committing to anything new, ask:
1. Which problem does this solve? (From `01-foundation/problems.md`)
2. How does this serve my mission? (From `01-foundation/mission.md`)
3. Which goal does this advance? (From `02-strategic/goals.md`)

If you can't answer clearly → Don't do it.

### The Review Habit
- **Never skip weekly reviews** - This is what makes the system work
- Reviews are NOT optional admin - They're how you learn and adapt
- Block the time like any other important commitment

### The Living Document Principle
- `telos.md` should reflect current reality, not aspirations
- Update it as things change (weekly minimum)
- It's a "streaming activity log" not a static plan

## File Relationships

```
problems.md
    ↓
mission.md
    ↓
goals.md ←→ challenges.md
    ↓           ↓
    ↓     strategies.md
    ↓           ↓

## When to Use Each File

| File | Update Frequency | Use When |
|------|------------------|----------|
| `telos.md` | Daily/Weekly | Starting day, making decisions, sharing context |
| `problems.md` | Quarterly | Fundamental priorities shift |
| `mission.md` | Quarterly | Purpose evolves or clarifies |
| `goals.md` | Weekly | Checking progress, setting new goals |
| `challenges.md` | Weekly | Obstacles change or resolve |

| `journal/` | Daily | Capturing what's happening |
| `kpis.md` | Weekly | Tracking key metrics |

---

## Integration with AI

Share your `telos.md` with AI assistants (like Claude Code) to:
- Get contextually relevant advice
- Make decisions aligned with your mission
- Generate ideas that serve your goals
- Get accountability and encouragement
- Receive personalized recommendations

**Example:** "Here's my telos.md. Given my mission and current challenges, what strategies would you suggest for goal G1?"

---

## Troubleshooting

### "The system feels overwhelming"
→ Simplify to core: `telos.md` + daily journal + weekly review
→ Build complexity gradually as needed

### "I don't know what my mission is"
→ Start with problems you care about
→ Mission emerges from sustained engagement with problems
→ Write Version 1.0 now, refine quarterly

### "I'm not making progress on goals"
→ Check: Are goals linked to mission?
→ Check: Do you have strategies for challenges?
→ Check: Are you doing weekly reviews?

### "I keep skipping reviews"
→ Make them shorter (15 min is enough)
→ Link to something you enjoy (coffee, music, etc.)
→ Schedule them, don't rely on motivation

---

## Success Indicators

**You know this system is working when:**
- You can trace any current project back to a core problem
- Decision-making becomes faster and clearer
- You say "no" more often (because it doesn't serve mission)
- Goals are progressing or you're pivoting intelligently
- Weekly review feels essential, not optional
- Life feels more aligned with purpose

---

## Remember

- **Done > Perfect:** Version 1.0 of anything beats version 0.0
- **Adapt Freely:** This system serves you, not vice versa
- **Review Consistently:** The magic is in the reflection
- **Trace Everything:** If it doesn't connect to mission, question it
- **Be Honest:** Radical clarity requires radical honesty
