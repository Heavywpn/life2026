## TOPIC 1: The Court Ruling Against NSO

### Key Facts:
- October 19th ruling
- Meta/Facebook sued NSO (not government prosecution)
- Permanent injunction against accessing WhatsApp/Meta products only
- Took 6 years to get ruling
- NSO recently acquired by U.S. investor group

### Critical Quotes:

**On the Limited Scope:**
> "So the ruling is very specific. It's a permanent injunction. That means they can never never in the future access WhatsApp and any other Meta product including Facebook and Instagram... But it's specifically to Meta because Meta brought the suit. It doesn't extend to anything else on your phone."

**On NSO's Broader Reach:**
> "I've seen it on regular people's phones, regular like you and I. We're just regular people. And so it's something that I've been concerned about for quite a while."

**On the Slow Legal Process:**
> "Unless you sue NSO, and this is what happened, unless you sue and wait six years, this took six years to get a ruling."

**On Future Implications:**
> "It raises issues for anybody who has been accessed, their data has been accessed by NSO, whether or not, you know, I think they have a suit to bring against NSO."

## TOPIC 2: NSO's Business Model & Capabilities

### Key Facts:
- Charges $20,000 per phone
- Final cost to governments: ~$50,000 per phone
- Has ties to Israel's Unit 8200 (elite cyber warfare unit)
- Cross-pollination with Apple facilities in Israel

### Critical Quotes:

**On Pricing:**
> "They charge $20,000 a phone. All right. So that it's it's a significant amount of money and they've got a lot invested in it."

**On Unit 8200:**
> "NSO has a long history with unit 8200 in Israel... This is not being political or nationalistic at all, but they're probably the best hacking group in the world."

**On Cross-Pollination:**
> "There's also a big facility, apple facility right there. And so we see a lot of cross-pollination taking place between NSO, the unit 8200 and Apple."

**David Bombal's Insight:**
> "That's why they're so good at hacking Apple products because really I mean this is why they have insight inner insight into the operating system that few others have."

## TOPIC 3: Government Surveillance & The NSA

### Key Facts:
- Pegasus banned in US but doesn't stop US agencies
- 17 intelligence agencies in the US
- NSA can spy on Americans communicating with "enemies"
- Agencies contract out malware development

### Critical Quotes:

**On Government Power:**
> "The three-letter agencies are always above the law. They make the law. Whatever they decide is legal is legal, right?"

**On NSA Capabilities:**
> "Not everything that the NSA does comes out of the NSA. They buy products, they buy services, and so they contract out, okay, to this kind of development, and they'll pay millions, tens of millions of dollars for products and services that they can spy on us."

**On Legal Justification for Spying:**
> "They can spy on Americans if they are in communication with somebody that they believe is a enemy... And so that basically doesn't exclude anybody really."

**OTW's Personal Experience:**
> "I know they listen to me because they tell me they are. I actually get messages and they say, 'Oh, just just know that we're listening.' That we know everything that you're doing."

**On Developing Malware for Government:**
> "For all you young hackers out there's actually a legitimate career that's legal to produce malware for governments. Okay? As long as you're serving the government, it's legal. If you're serving somebody else, it's illegal."

**On Edward Snowden Revelations:**
> David: "The US organizations couldn't spy on US citizens. So, they just got GCHQ in the UK to do it, and then they could spy all their telecommunications of US citizens."
> OTW: "I do remember that. Yes. And that's the way that the intelligence agencies work hand in hand."

**On Real-World Uses:**
> "If a government wants to find somebody to kill them, or to disappear them, they can find them. And similar software has been being used recently by ICE, not the same software, but similar software by ICE in the US to locate people that they want to deport from the United States."

## TOPIC 4: The iPhone "Unhackable" Myth

### Key Facts:
- OTW's forensic firm regularly finds extensive malware on iPhones
- Apple's marketing doesn't match reality
- Simple attack vectors exist that aren't publicly discussed
- Cross-pollination between Apple and NSO gives unique insights

### Critical Quotes:

**The Bombshell Statement:**
> "One of the services that we offer at Hackers Arise is that we help people who've been hacked. And I will tell you from firsthand experience that there's a lot of malware on Apple phones. Okay. We see a lot."

**On Apple's False Claims:**
> "That first statement that off-the-shelf malware cannot be used against Apple products is false. Right? So, and people who are listening to this, okay, all of you who are listening, many of you know this already. Many of you already know this because you know that your phone's been hacked, right?"

**The Proof:**
> "I got all these phones right here that are full of malware. So that's my proof. So people come to me like, I bought an iPhone because I thought it was unhackable. Well, you're proof that it's not."

**On Apple's Marketing:**
> "What bothers me about Apple is they try to sell the public that the system is unhackable and then you know these people like have all the evidence that they've been hacked and but they're convinced that it's not their phone because the phone is unhackable."

**On Memory Integrity Enforcement:**
> "This reminds me the new measures by Apple, you know, the what they call the memory integrity enforcement sounds a lot like ASLR where, you know, we've had this in our operating systems for well over a decade... and it became relatively easy to overcome."

**The Assessment:**
> "It'll slow some people down. Yeah, it'll slow some people down. It'll probably make it a little harder to hack than an Apple phone, but quite frankly, it's not that hard right now."

**Balanced View:**
> "I give Apple, you know, a lot more credit than I give to Google in terms of cyber security... They take it far more seriously than the Android platform does and the other platforms do. But at the same time, to sell the idea that it's unhackable is not true. That's marketing fluff. That's not real."

## TOPIC 5: Apple's Bug Bounty Program

### Key Facts:
- Increased from $1M to $2M for general exploits
- Up to $5M for lockdown mode bypasses
- Black market pays $50-100M+ for same exploits

### Critical Quotes:

**The Economic Reality:**
> "Okay, so if I'm sitting home in my home lab and I develop a Pegasus like piece of malware... It's going to be worth a lot more than $5 million to sell to governments, right?"

**The Math:**
> "I can get $5 million from Apple or I can get 50 million or 100 million from selling to governments. What do you think I'm going to do?"

**What Would Work:**
> "They need to put up maybe 50 million just to compete with the black market and they're not doing that right now. I'm glad to see that they're putting up 5 million. That's kind of sets a new bar but it doesn't necessarily solve the problem."

## TOPIC 6: The Widespread Malware Epidemic

### Key Facts:
- Discovery happened ~9 months ago (from interview date)
- Even OTW initially thought these victims had mental health issues
- Affects phones, computers, routers, smart homes
- Low-level hackers, not state actors
- Multiple sources of malware on single devices

### Critical Quotes:

**The Shocking Discovery:**
> "Since we started doing forensic investigations on phones and computers and what have you, I'm shocked to see how much malware these people have on their phones."

**The Reversal:**
> "I get these emails all the time like, 'Oh, my house has been hacked, my home has been hacked, my car has been hacked, my computer's been hacked, and my phone's been hacked, and my garage door has been hacked, and my speaker has been hacked, my smart home has been hacked.' And I would go right away. I'd look at that and I'd go, 'These people have mental health problems. It's not this isn't a hacking problem. This is a mental health.' But I now take that back. Okay."

**The Reality:**
> "I take that back. They really are hacked. We have been going through these homes and we've been going through these phones and we've been going through these computers and they're full of malware. They're full of their routers are full of malware. Their smart home devices are full of malware."

**Real-World Impact:**
> "People are having their garage doors open randomly, their lights go on and off, the doors open and close because in a smart home you can do all of those things once you're inside that network."

**The Source:**
> "It looks like it's kind of low-level hacking. It's not like real sophisticated hacking. So it's not coming from a advanced persistent threat. It's not coming from a government. It's coming like low-level hackers are hacking people for whatever reason."

**Multiple Infection Sources:**
> "It's coming from all different places. It's not just one place. And it's not the government. It's coming in from all different places. And they have malware from multiple sources."

**Timeline:**
> "Some of you out there know what I'm talking about because you've experienced this, but I would have said they were all crazy until recently. It's like maybe nine months ago."

## TOPIC 7: Hacker-for-Hire & Personal Vendettas

### Key Facts:
- Neighbors hacking neighbors
- Business competitors hiring hackers
- Friends targeting friends
- Affordable pricing ($500-$2,000)

### Critical Quotes:

**Examples:**
> "People are using hacker for hire services and hacking their friends neighbors business competitor. I saw one recently I have a client who's a YouTuber and his YouTube competitor paid somebody to hack his phone and it was inside his phones and just driving him crazy."

**The Ecosystem:**
> "There's a lot of people out there who will do this work for you. You don't even have to do the work. You just say, 'Hey, I want to hack this person's phone,' or 'I want to hack this person's smart home,' or 'I want to hack this person's computer,' and they say, 'Okay, no problem. It's $500 or $2,000' or whatever and they do that work for you."

## TOPIC 8: The Malware-as-a-Service Industry

### Key Facts:
- Modular malware sold on dark web
- Different modules for different targets
- No coding skills required
- Pick-and-choose features like "building a house"

### Critical Quotes:

**The Modular System:**
> "We actually went in and took apart some of the malware and you can see the developer put it together and it's very modular so you can buy different modules. You can buy the module that gets inside the phone, you can buy the module that gets inside the computer, you can buy the module that gets inside a smart home."

**Customization:**
> "It's sort of like an alarm system where you can sort of say, 'I want this, this, and this, but I don't want this, this, and this' and so you build your malware kind of like building a house."

**Accessibility:**
> "You may not be a good enough coder to write a piece of malware to get inside David Bomble's phone, but I can buy a piece of malware that can get inside of your phone or your computer or your smart home, and put it in there, and I don't need to be a very talented developer."

**The Ecosystem:**
> "There's this whole new industry on top of that which is the hacker for hire industry... and so this is a very complex multilayered ecosystem that exists out there in the dark web."

**Future Threat:**
> "As far as I know, we haven't seen any ransomware on phones yet, but it's coming, you know, we'll see ransomware. 'Hey, we got access to your phone and we're going to threaten you, unless you pay us.' That kind of stuff hasn't happened yet, but it's coming probably."

## TOPIC 9: Social Engineering as Primary Attack Vector

### Key Facts:
- 80% of hacks involve social engineering
- Two-part attack: social entry + technical persistence
- Simple methods exist that OTW won't disclose publicly

### Critical Quotes:

**The 80% Rule:**
> "Social engineering has an element of social engineering which goes back to what I've said so many times is that like 80% of the hacks have a social engineering element."

**Two-Part Attack:**
> "Social engineering is how you get into the system. But then what you do inside the system is very technical. So you've got to have a good product. Once you're inside the system, you got to have a good product to get in there and stay in there, right? So you can control the system."

**The Undisclosed iPhone Vulnerability:**
> David: "How did they get hacked though?"
> OTW: "I think I'm going to refrain from answering that because it's too easy and what we've seen is is a very simple way. It's a very simple way to get into an iPhone. And I'm not going to mention it here because, you know, we'll see more of it then, right?"

**Still Social Engineering:**
> "There's some simple ways and I guess you would probably throw it into the category of social engineering. You probably put it in that way."

**Mr. Robot Reference:**
> "There's a scene the very first season where Elliott is talking to Vera's brother... and he hacks his phone because easily because they're on the same Wi-Fi network... Once he's on the same network, then it's easy, relatively everything's relative, right? Relatively easy to hack that phone."

---

## TOPIC 10: Meta/Facebook's Hypocrisy

### Key Facts:
- Facebook/Meta spy on users constantly
- They sell user data for profit
- But they sued to prevent others from spying on their platform

### Critical Quotes:

**David's Cynical Take:**
> "Let me see if I got this right. Mark Zuckerberg is upset that someone is spying on his software. Doesn't he spy on us all the time?"

**The Territory Argument:**
> "WhatsApp spies on all of us and Facebook spies... but they don't want anybody else spying on us. They only want to spy on us. This is our territory. Only we can spy here."

**OTW's Agreement:**
> "It's kind of like trespassing, right? That's basically what they're saying. It's like this is our territory. Only we can spy here. You can't."

**The Business Model:**
> "Facebook is spying on us and they're selling our data. You know, they're selling everything they know about us. And that's kind of the model of the IT industry right now is that companies are making huge amounts of money just selling our information."

**Classic Quote:**
> "A very wise man said a long time ago that if a service is free, you're not the customer, you're the product."

## TOPIC 11: Software as Service vs. Product

### Key Facts:
- U.S. law classifies all software as "service" not "product"
- Product liability laws don't apply to software
- Lobbyists ensured this classification
- If changed, could dramatically improve security

### Critical Quotes:

**The Legal Distinction:**
> "Technically in the United States all software is considered a service. So that's why for instance if your car has a defect and you die in a crash because your car has a defect you can sue the car manufacturer... But that doesn't apply to software because in the United States software is a service. It's not a product."

**The Lobbying:**
> "It's one of those things that the lobbyists in the United States got software tagged as a service rather than a product."

**The Impact:**
> "If it was considered a product every time you lost your data because you know of a hack, you could sue the developer like you can with a car."

**Bruce Schneier's Argument:**
> "Bruce Schneier said this a long time ago and he said if we make software into a product and hold them responsible like we do with products then there will be a lot fewer bad software out there that hackers can easily get inside of."

## TOPIC 12: Security Recommendations

### The Essentials:

**1. Resist Social Engineering (Most Important):**
> "Don't fall for social engineering so you know be aware that people are trying to trick you into getting into your system. So that's the first and most important probably the most important piece... if you just close the door to social engineering you've defeated 80% of all the attacks."

**2. Don't Trust Manufacturer Claims:**
> "Take cyber security more seriously. I think that the mobile device manufacturers are telling you oh just relax everything's fine we'll take care of you. That's what Apple is basically saying to you. Everything's fine. We'll take care of you. Your phone is unhackable. That is false. Don't believe that."

**3. Use Security Tools:**
> "I would suggest using a VPN, a password manager, certainly use a complex password, not a simple password."

**4. Stay Alert:**
> "Be aware of what your device is doing. If your device is acting funny, something's going on with your device."

**5. Educate Yourself:**
> "Learn more about cyber security, learn more about IT if you want to protect yourself... It's very important to know what the threats are out there."

## TOPIC 13: The Bigger Picture

### Critical Quotes on Industry & Future:

**On the Malware Industry:**
> "There really is this malware industry and it's actually quite a large industry that is creating all these modules that low level hackers can use now."

**On the Ruling's Limitations:**
> "It's not just one malware, it's not just Pegasus, there's this whole industry here that is producing things to spy on people... We'll have these rulings that kind of address one issue at a time, which is important, but it doesn't solve the problem."

**On the Scope:**
> "In this particular case, it's actually a very narrow ruling that only applies to NSO, only applies to WhatsApp, okay? And so it's very encouraging. It sends a message. Maybe that message is hey other companies also sue NSO... but there's a lot of other malware out there that we have to be worried about."

**The Reality Check:**
> "We see the malware on the devices that are sitting in our office and so this is something that's very real. This is not a theoretical issue. This is a real everyday issue that people need to be worried about."

**Shaping the Future:**
> "I think we're shaping the future of cyber security right now in real time. So these kinds of rulings will have effect, you know, for years to come."

## Three Markets for Zero-Day Exploits

1. **Defensive (Vendors like Apple):** $2-5 million
2. **Government/Military:** $50-100+ million
3. **Criminal (Dark Web):** Variable, potentially very high

**The Incentive Problem:**
> "There are bright people out there who are looking and going, wow, I can get $5 million from Apple or I can get 50 million or 100 million from selling to governments. What do you think I'm going to do?"

---

## Most Important Takeaways

### 1. The Myth vs. Reality Gap:
> "Apple is in the dark in that regard that they don't realize that their phones are getting hacked and they're getting hacked at a really high level."

### 2. The Ecosystem is Bigger Than You Think:
> "It's not just one piece of malware. And so we can have these rulings that kind of address one issue at a time, which is important, but it doesn't solve the problem."

### 3. You're Likely Already Compromised:
> "Many of you know this already. Many of you already know this because you know that your phone's been hacked, right?"

### 4. The Timeline:
> "This is something that's been eye-opening to me because for years I thought that those people were imagining that they were hacked... But in reality, they are hacked. They have been hacked... It's like maybe nine months ago."

### 5. Personal Responsibility:
> "Take it more seriously. Don't believe that [manufacturers will protect you]. So, take it more seriously."
