## New Content Added

### 1. Jocko Willink - Confidence Through Humility Interview

**Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoAl1nSg6rM

**Files Created:**
- **Transcript:** `creators/transcripts/jocko-willink-confidence-humility-transcript.txt` (12KB, 325 lines)
- **Analysis:** `creators/summaries/jocko-willink-confidence-humility-analysis.md` (28KB, 841 lines, 40 sections)

**Core Philosophy:**
- **The Paradox:** True confidence requires humility - being comfortable saying "I don't know"
- **Two-State Model:** Prepare with humility (train relentlessly), execute with confidence (100% certainty)
- **The Physical Switch:** Use triggers (night vision goggles, knocking arrow, microphone) to transition mindsets
- **The Circular Cycle:** Humility → Preparation → Competence → Confidence → Performance → Learning → Humility

**Key Insights:**
1. Fake confidence creates anxiety and prevents learning
2. Admitting "I don't know" builds respect, not loses it
3. Lower expectations to eliminate performance anxiety, then exceed the bar
4. Elite performers (Kobe, Jordan, Bird) practiced insanely, then demanded ball in clutch

## Key Quotes

### On Confidence Through Humility:
> "If you want to be confident, you got to be humble. And then when you're humble, then you are more confident cuz you're okay with not knowing."

### On The Execution Switch:
> "At the moment I put my night vision goggles on and I lower them down over my eyes, there's like a switch that goes off that I am 100% going to win."

### On Leadership:
> "Hey, Chris, I'm not really sure what to do right now. Does your respect for me go down or does it go up? Goes up. Exactly."

### Kobe's Mamba Mentality:
> "If you see me in a fight with a bear, pray for the bear. That's mamba mentality. We don't quit. We don't cower. We don't run. We endure and conquer."
