## Core Philosophy Summary

**Unix Philosophy for Life**:
1. Do one thing and do it well
2. Composability over convergence
3. Intentionality over convenience
4. Purpose-specific over "convenient"
5. Question corporate narratives

**Key Question for Every Purchase**:
> "Does this do ONE thing excellently, or is it compromised by trying to do everything?"

**The Reward System**:
> "The greater reward comes from improving intentionality. Doing things more intentionally with purpose-built items is the better reward than just pursuing convenience."
