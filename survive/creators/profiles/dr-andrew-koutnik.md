## Personal Notes & Observations

### Initial Impressions
Extremely credible researcher with impressive institutional backing (IHMC, Sansum, USF under D'Agostino). Personal stake in research (Type 1 diabetic) adds authenticity. World-record findings on fat oxidation are paradigm-shifting. Communication style accessible despite academic rigor. Challenges dogma with evidence, not ideology.

### Evolution of Opinion
TBD - First content piece analyzed

### Standout Moments
- **1.85g/min fat oxidation**: Highest ever recorded, at 85%+ VO2 max (previously thought impossible)
- **No performance difference**: High-carb vs. low-carb pre-exercise meals showed identical results
- **Glycogen preservation**: Keto-adapted athletes maintain normal glycogen despite low carb intake
- **Controlled methodology**: "We control variables other studies don't" - rigorous approach
- **Transparent surprises**: Admits when findings challenge even his expectations

### Red Flags/Concerns
- **Limited content access**: Not prolific content creator, primarily researcher
- **Sample sizes**: Some studies with 15 subjects (small, though well-controlled)
- **Selection bias**: Studied athletes may not represent average person
- **Lab requirements**: Some assessments require equipment not available to most
- **Career focus**: Heavy keto/low-carb focus may limit balanced perspective
- **Funding transparency**: Unclear what entities fund the research

### Questions to Research
- [ ] Full publication list review for comprehensive understanding
- [ ] What percentage of studies support vs. challenge keto benefits?
- [ ] Long-term follow-up on study subjects?
- [ ] Funding sources and potential conflicts of interest?
- [ ] What does D'Agostino lab say about findings?
- [ ] Replication by other research groups?

## Quick Reference
**Primary Value**: World-class researcher providing peer-reviewed evidence that challenges sports nutrition dogma (fat oxidation of 1.85g/min at 85%+ VO2 max)
**Best Content**: Podcast interviews for accessibility (Thomas DeLauer, IHMC STEM-Talk), papers for depth
**Credibility**: Very High (5/5 - Ph.D., peer-reviewed, prestigious collaborations, transparent methodology)
**Project Fit**: Excellent - provides evidence-based foundation for metabolic flexibility, reduced carb dependency
**Update Frequency**: Monitor for new publications and interviews, check quarterly

## Key Research Summary

### Major Findings
1. **5K/10K Performance Study**: No difference between high-carb and low-carb pre-exercise meals
2. **1-Mile Time Trial (4-week keto)**: No performance loss, fat oxidation 1.5-1.85g/min (world record)
3. **12-Week Cycling Study**: Equal improvements in VO2 max, lactate threshold on keto vs. high-carb
4. **Glycogen Preservation**: Keto-adapted athletes maintain normal glycogen despite low carb intake

### Paradigm Shifts
- Carbohydrates NOT essential for high-intensity performance (when adapted)
- Fat oxidation ceiling is trainable (1.85g/min vs. old belief of 0.5-0.7g/min)
- Performance is multifactorial, not just fuel source dependent
- 4+ weeks adaptation required for metabolic flexibility

### Practical Applications
- Pre-exercise carb loading may be unnecessary for events under 60-90 minutes
- Fasted training viable for middle-distance events
- Metabolic flexibility is trainable skill over 4-12 weeks
- Individual variation exists - test what works for you
