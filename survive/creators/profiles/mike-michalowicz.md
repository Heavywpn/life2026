## Content Overview

### Primary Content Format
- **Platform**: Published books (print, audiobook, e-book), Keynote speaking
- **Format**: Business methodology books with step-by-step implementation
- **Frequency**: Regular book releases (9 books total)
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Profit-first cash management
  - Business growth strategies
  - Entrepreneurial mindset
  - Financial discipline and systems
  - Marketing and customer acquisition
  - Business systemization

### Profit First Methodology
**Core Philosophy**: Flip the accounting formula
- Traditional: Sales - Expenses = Profit (profit is leftover, if any)
- **Profit First**: Sales - Profit = Expenses (profit taken first, expenses fit what's left)

**The System**:
1. **5 Bank Accounts**: Income, Profit, Owner's Pay, Tax, Operating Expenses (Opex)
2. **Allocation Percentages**: Predetermined percentages for each account
3. **Twice-Monthly Transfers**: Regular discipline, not sporadic decisions
4. **Target Allocation Percentages (TAPs)**: Gradually move toward optimal percentages

**4 Core Principles**:
1. **Use Smaller Plates**: Multiple accounts force spending discipline (less cash visible = less spending)
2. **Start Small**: Begin with 1% profit allocation, build habit gradually
3. **Profit as Habit**: Make profitability automatic, not aspirational
4. **Force Innovation**: Limited cash forces frugality, creativity, efficiency

## Credibility Assessment

### Strengths
- Personal experience (failed business, rebuilt from scratch)
- Behavioral economics approach (works with human psychology, not against it)
- Proven track record (1+ million companies use Profit First)
- Simple, actionable systems (not complex theory)
- Wall Street Journal credibility, MSNBC exposure
- Simon Sinek endorsement

### Potential Biases
