### Questions to Consider
- [ ] Is 4:30am wake-up necessary or is it Jocko's personal extreme?
- [ ] How much military context is too much for civilian preparedness?
- [ ] Can Extreme Ownership lead to burnout if misapplied (taking responsibility for truly uncontrollable events)?
- [ ] Does jiu-jitsu training have preparedness value beyond fitness?
- [ ] How to balance Jocko's intensity with sustainable long-term practice?

### Content Gaps to Explore
- [ ] Family preparedness (children, elderly) - less focus in SEAL context
- [ ] Female perspective on resilience (SEALs all-male)
- [ ] Medical preparedness beyond trauma care
- [ ] Homesteading and self-sufficiency (Mike Glover better for this)
- [ ] Technical skills (cybersecurity, infrastructure) - David Bombal/Chuck better
