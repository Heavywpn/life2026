## Survival Project Applications

### Skills Demonstrated
1. **Financial discipline** - Daily budget adherence
2. **Adaptability** - Plan adjustment when ferry cost arose
3. **Free resource identification** - Research and execution
4. **Self-sufficiency** - Camping, van life, cooking
5. **Regional reconnaissance** - Market intelligence, local produce
6. **Food security** - Grocery shopping, market sourcing
7. **Mental resilience** - Positive attitude despite constraints

### Philosophy Extracted
> "You don't need to spend so much money... it's possible to do it on the cheap. We're here with our 95 cent crackers and we're still having fun."

**Survival Parallel**: Resource constraints don't prevent mission success—creativity and knowledge unlock solutions.

### Bamboo Metaphor (Growth Under Surface)
> "If you ever feel like you're not making progress in life, bamboo will grow for meters and meters under the ground before it's ever visible. And then you get past a certain point and it will just shoot up hundreds of meters into the sky."

**Application**: Preparedness work (skills, supplies, knowledge) may not show immediate results, but underground preparation creates rapid capability when needed.

## Quotes Worth Saving

1. **Coffee jitters**: "I literally just looked at Megan. I said it just hit me."
2. **Budget travel philosophy**: "You don't need to spend so much money... there's so much free stuff you can go and do. You don't need to have a big experience budget."
3. **Wealthy suburb tours**: "We can't buy. We can just look." (learned from mom)
4. **Budget reality**: "After we get the ice creams that we want, we got eight bucks [for dinner]. So that's going to be interesting."
5. **Daintree reaction**: "It is honestly like we're in Jurassic Park."
6. **Ferry cost mistake**: "How did we forget this? What a cracker."

## Personal Notes

First Jack & Megan content analyzed. Impressed by:
- Honest budget tracking (shows failures)
- High production quality while maintaining authenticity
- Strategic resource allocation philosophy
- Adaptability demonstrations (ferry cost)
