## Experiment Design & Results

### Methodology

**Test Subject**: Carrots
**Duration**: Several months (until spring harvest)
**Pots**: 4 identical large pots
**Growing Medium**: 50% river sand + 50% compost (4 variations)
**Controlled Variables**:
- Same water amount
- No fertilizer added
- Same sunlight exposure
- Same seed batch (measured quantity)

### Four Compost Types

1. **Homemade (Weedy's biodynamic)**: 1,370g - **LAST** (compromised by rat damage)
2. **Worm castings (Wormville)**: 1,717g - 3rd place
3. **Store-bought nursery soil**: 1,640g - 2nd-to-last
4. **Red Soil Organics Morpheus**: 2,721g - **WINNER** (30% more than second place)

**Taste test**: No discernible difference between any samples

## Key Expert: Kane (Red Soil Organics)

### Background
- Owner/operator of Red Soil Organics
- Sunshine Coast, Australia
- Considered "the best compost in Australia" by multiple sources
- Deep expertise in fermentation science and soil biology

### Commercial Composting Process Explained

**Three-Stage Fermentation**:

1. **Primary Stage**: Capture manure quickly after leaving animal
   - Goal: Stabilize nitrogen and carbon before degradation
   - Reduce oxygen, create anaerobic environment
   - "Beautiful" middle-state fermentation

2. **Wind Row Stage**: Active aerobic decomposition
   - Roll or fork piles for oxygen introduction
   - Weekly inoculation with microbes
   - Add kelp, materials to stimulate specific blends
   - Monitor moisture and temperature

3. **Final Stack**: Fungal curing fermentation
   - Final stabilization and humus formation
   - Nitrogen bound to sticky carbon matrix

### Why Commercial Wins

- **Higher piles** (machinery enables, changes ecosystem)
- **Gravity compression** (affects particle dynamics)
- **Faster capture** (less nitrogen/carbon loss)
- **Manure base** (best organic nitrogen source)
- **Consistent quality** (controlled process)

### The Morpheus Blend

**Philosophy**: "Red pill" of self-sufficiency (Matrix reference)

**Ingredients**:
- Cow and pig manure
- Jigle manure
- Rose grass chaff (grown on-site)
- 50mm hardwood mulch
- Locally milled hardwood sawdust
- Locally milled arborist chip

**Target audience**: Anyone anywhere (suburbia to farmlands, any soil) can grow own food

## Composting Science Insights

### Myth Busted: Hot Compost Turning Frequency

**Popular Method**: 18-28 day hot compost, turn every 1-2 days

**Kane's Correction**:
- Every 2-3 days is BETTER than more frequent
- Biology needs time to stabilize between disturbances
- "You're upsetting the ecosystem" with too-frequent turning
- Oxygen doesn't deplete as fast as commonly thought
- 50% woody matter = only need to turn every 4-5 days

**Weedy's Reaction**: "Oh no" (made video promoting frequent turning)

**Kane's Reassurance**: "It's a bang on video for the method... but you can do a better method"

### Home vs. Commercial Compost

**Home Compost Strengths**:
- Diverse inputs from specific land
- Closed-loop system
- "Land recognizes its own materials"
- Free/low-cost
- Waste reduction

**Home Compost Limitations**:
- Lower nitrogen levels
- "Midground kind of placid"
- Smaller piles = different microbial ecosystem
- Labor intensive to scale
- Slower process

**Commercial Strengths**:
- Manure-based (optimal nitrogen)
- Higher piles (better fermentation)
- Machinery efficiency
- Multiple specialized stages
- "Intensified version"

---

## Quality Compost Indicators (Per Kane)

### 1. Strong Ammonia Smell
- "Clears your sinuses"
- Multiple nitrogen compounds (nitrate, ammonia)
- "Fertilizer-grade strength"
- Indicates active, available nitrogen

### 2. Sticky Humus Texture
- Sticks to pores of skin
- Turns hands black/dark
- Carbon bound to nitrogen
- "That soulless soil... that's really what you're chasing"

### 3. Dark Rich Color
- Black or very dark brown
- Complete decomposition
- Humus formation complete

### 4. Proper Moisture Level
- Not dusty, not soggy
- Optimal for microbial activity

---

## Application Technique

### DON'T DO THIS:
- ❌ Apply thick layer and plant directly
- ❌ Turn/invert soil (destroys ecosystem)
- ❌ Skip integration step

### DO THIS:

1. Remove old mulch
2. **Aerate soil with fork** (lift, don't turn)
   - Preserves soil ecosystem
   - "Keeping that precious ecosystem right under my feet completely intact"
3. Water well
4. Apply 5cm (2 inch) compost layer on top
5. Gently scratch/rake into surface
6. Apply thin sugarcane mulch layer
7. Water again
8. Plant seedlings

**Why**: Direct planting causes seedling "shock" or "implosion"

## Community Food Systems Philosophy

### "The Macro Community Organism"

**Key Insight from Weedy**:
> "It's totally fine if you have to outsource your soil because there is some people that actually do it for a living and do it really well. And so you're supporting them, you're supporting your garden, and you're able to take it a little bit easier with your own compost turning."

**Kane Adds**:
> "That's also part of the system. It's like you don't have to do everything yourself. There are members in the community that also are doing things and if we all support each other then we're creating that macro community organism."

### Implications

1. **Specialization** creates better outcomes
2. **Community resilience** > individual self-reliance
3. **Time optimization** allows focus on other skills
4. **Economic support** for regenerative agriculture
5. **Realistic expectations** prevent burnout

3. **Promoted too-frequent turning**
   - Made video on 18-28 day hot compost
   - Kane revealed less frequent is better

### What Worked Well

1. **Experimental methodology**
   - Controlled variables
   - Measured results
   - Honest reporting

2. **Willingness to learn**
   - Sought out best expert

## Technical Details Worth Noting

### Carrot Observations

**Question Raised**: Why do homegrown carrots have long thin "tails" that store carrots don't have?

**Weedy's Note**: "Can anybody out there tell me why these carrots look like that? Because when I buy carrots from the store, they don't have that long thing on them. But all my carrots do."

**Store-bought issues**: "Full of little tiny hairs everywhere"

### Worm Casting Results

- Many carrots, but mostly small ones
- Few large carrots
- Consistent but size-limited
- 1,717g total (middle of pack)

### Store-Bought Soil Issues

- Some rotten carrots during growth
- Very hairy root systems
- Inconsistent quality
- 1,640g total (second-to-last)

## Red Flags & Concerns

### Experimental Methodology

1. **Rat damage invalidates one test group**
   - Weedy's compost eaten by rats
   - Still included in results
   - True performance unknown

2. **No fertilized control**
   - Don't know if 2,721g is good or average
   - Chemical fertilizer comparison would help

3. **Single trial**
