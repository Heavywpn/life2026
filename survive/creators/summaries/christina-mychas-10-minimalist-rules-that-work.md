## Core Philosophy Summary

### The Central Thesis: Intentionality Over Minimalism

**Key Insight:**
```
The key to minimalism is to just live with intentionality and think before you buy.
You don't have to identify as a minimalist or make what you consume or not consume
your entire personality.
```

Christina practiced minimalism for 2.5 years but found it "easy to take too far." She now identifies as "minimalist-ish" - taking the best principles without the extreme lifestyle.

## The 10 Minimalist Rules That Actually Work

---

### Rule 1: Buy Nice or Buy Twice

**Core Principle:** Purchase the highest quality you can afford to avoid replacement costs.

**Implementation:**
- Research before buying
- Compare brands
- Test items before purchase
- Focus on value, not just price

**TikTok Series:** "You're Too Broke to Buy Cheap"

**Key Quote:**
> "If you just go for the cheapest thing, it may not be high quality and you end up spending more money in the long run looking to replace it."

**Why It Works:**
- Forces slower, more deliberate purchasing
- Items last longer, reducing overall spending
- Maximizes value per dollar spent

**Note:** This doesn't mean buy the most expensive - buy the BEST you can AFFORD.

### Rule 2: If It's Not a Hell Yes, It's a No

**Source:** Derek Sivers (author/entrepreneur)

**Core Principle:** Eliminate lukewarm commitments. Only accept things you're genuinely excited about.

**Applications:**
- Purchasing decisions
- Commitments and obligations
- Relationships and activities
- Allowing things into your life/space

**Key Quote:**
> "If you allow things into your life that feel lukewarm, I think that's when it's really easy to either build up a whole lot of clutter... but it can also lead to things like resentment and burnout."

**Why It Works:**
- Clears physical clutter
- Prevents emotional burnout
- Strengthens gut-feeling decision making
- Weeds out "maybes" that drain energy

---

### Rule 3: Declutter First, Organize Second

**Core Principle:** Don't buy organizers for clutter. Remove what doesn't belong first.

**The Trap:**
Organization YouTube/TikTok focuses on buying MORE stuff (containers, labels, systems) to organize existing possessions.

**Implementation:**
1. If space feels cluttered/overwhelming → too much junk
2. Declutter first (remove what's unnecessary)
3. Organize only what remains
4. True organization requires minimal investment

**Key Quote:**
> "I think truly being organized doesn't require spending a lot of money or any money at all. It's often more of a stuff problem and a clutter problem first."

**Why It Works:**
- Prevents buying organizers for items you'll eventually discard
- Saves money on unnecessary organization products
- Creates genuine simplicity, not hidden chaos

---

### Rule 4: If You Don't Use It, You Lose It

**Core Principle:** Everything must meet one of three criteria: Joy, Use, or Value.

**Implementation:**
- Regularly evaluate belongings
- Check medicine cabinets for expired items
- Review makeup/skincare for what's unused
- Assess clothing you haven't worn
- Maintain space, don't set-and-forget

**Key Quote:**
> "The thing about maintaining a more minimal, organized, or decluttered space is that it does require some level of maintenance... your taste and use and need for things is going to change over time."

**Why It Works:**
- Prevents accumulation of unused items
- Keeps space functional and relevant
- Acknowledges that needs change over time
- Treats organization as ongoing, not one-time

---

### Rule 5: Wishlist and Wait

**Core Principle:** Separate the impulse of wanting from the act of buying.

**Implementation:**
1. See something you want → Add to wishlist (Notes app)
2. Set it and forget it
3. Optionally journal:
   - Price of item
   - Why you want it (be honest)
4. Wait before purchasing
5. Use wishlist when ready to shop intentionally

**Key Quote:**
> "There's a lot of reasons why we want certain things, but a lot of times they are really impulsive and all you need to do is give yourself a little bit of breathing space."

**Why It Works:**
- Separates emotion from transaction
- Reveals true vs. impulse desires
- Creates delayed gratification habit
- Focused shopping (stick to list)
- Especially effective for online shopping and social media triggers

---

### Rule 6: A Place for Everything, Everything in Its Place

**Core Principle:** Assign homes for items. Return them consistently.

**Applications (macro to micro):**
- Wallet always in same purse pocket
- Adapters in specific drawer (no tangled cord pile)
- Closet organized by garment type and color
- Keys in designated spot

**Key Quote:**
> "Sometimes there's nothing more overwhelming than having to clean up a huge mess. This way it keeps the mess a lot smaller and easy to manage."

**Benefits:**
- Always know where to find things
- Reduces search time
- Makes getting dressed/ready easier
- Prevents mess accumulation
- Space stays functional

---

### Rule 7: Don't Buy a Problem

**Core Principle:** Ensure purchases don't create additional purchases or work.

**Examples of Buying Problems:**
- New rug → couch doesn't match → need new pillows → snowball effect
- Thrifted clothes 4 sizes too big → expensive tailoring required
- Piece that matches nothing → need accessories/complementary items
- Can't afford it → credit card debt (problem with interest)

**Warning Signs:**
- Feeling you need to "rationalize" the purchase
- Item requires significant modification
- Creates cascade of additional "needs"
- Requires debt to acquire

**Key Quote:**
> "If I start feeling that way about anything I'm buying, or I feel like I really need to rationalize my way into making the purchase, then I know that it's probably not for me."

---

### Rule 8: Have a Why Before You Buy

**Core Principle:** Understand your TRUE motivation for wanting something.

**The Exercise:**
1. Identify what you want to buy
2. Ask: "Why do I want this?"
3. Be HONEST with the answer
4. Recognize embarrassing reasons

**Common Embarrassing "Whys":**
- "It's on sale"
- "I can't pass up this deal"
- "It's the brand" (not because I actually like it)
- FOMO
- Social pressure
- Emotional void filling

**Key Quote:**
> "If I was really honest with myself and dug deep into some whys behind some purchases that I made, a lot of the times they were kind of really embarrassing and not great reasons."

**Why It Works:**
- Exposes impulse vs. genuine need
- Slows down purchasing
- Saves money and clutter
- Builds self-awareness about shopping triggers

---

### Rule 9: The Spark Joy Rule

**Source:** Marie Kondo

**Core Principle:** Keep/buy only items that spark genuine, immediate joy.

**Important Distinction:**
- "Spark Joy" must be HONEST and IMMEDIATE
- Not waffling: "meh, I'm not sure, I don't know"
- Must be a "hell yes" (connects to Rule 2)

**Balance:**
> "I think it's important and okay to have things simply because you like them... but I think it's important to also be honest with that."

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents using "spark joy" as excuse to keep everything
- Counters purely utilitarian minimalism
- Allows sentimental items (disagrees with "just take a picture" advice)
- Gentle but realistic approach

---

### Rule 10: If I Can't Pay for It in Full Today, I Can't Afford It

**Core Principle:** No debt for wants. Cash or save first.

**Implementation:**
1. Want something? Check if you can pay cash now
2. If not → create savings plan
3. Don't use credit for non-necessities
4. Saving process itself increases intentionality

**Key Quote:**
> "If you find yourself often relying on credit and using debt to buy things, especially things that are wants and not needs, then no matter what you are buying a problem, and that problem comes with interest."

**The Hidden Benefit:**
- Saving period allows you to evaluate if you really want it
- Often forget purchases by time package arrives (impulse revealed)
- Makes final purchase more intentional and valued

## Integration with Survival Mindset

### Preparedness Connection

- Intentionality over convenience

### Cross-Reference with Project

**Ben Vallack Connection:**
- Don't buy a problem = composability (avoid convergence devices that create dependencies)
- Quality focus = Unix philosophy (do one thing well)
- Intentional purchasing = anti-consumerism

**Jocko Willink Connection:**
- Discipline in purchasing
- Delayed gratification
- Honest self-assessment
