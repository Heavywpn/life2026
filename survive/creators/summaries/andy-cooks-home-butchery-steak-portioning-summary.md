# Andy Cooks - Home Butchery: Steak Portioning Guide

**Creator**: Andy Cooks
**Video ID**: FafoPKIqxLM
**Date Analyzed**: 2025-11-22
**Topic**: How to Portion Steaks Like a Chef to Save Money
**Sponsor**: Maiden (carbon steel cookware)

---

## Core Concept

**Problem**: Pre-portioned steaks at supermarkets/butchers are expensive and often too thin
**Solution**: Buy subprimals and portion yourself - save money and control thickness/quality

**Key Philosophy**: "It's the beauty of doing it like this" - control your own "cuisson" (French term for desired steak doneness)

---

## Five Subprimals Covered

1. **Sirloin** (New York Strip/Strip Loin) - "One of my favorite steaks"
2. **Fillet** (Tenderloin/Eye Fillet) - Leanest, most tender
3. **Rump** (Top Sirloin) - "Fantastic place to start home butchery"
4. **Ribeye** (Scotch Fillet/Cube Roll) - "Could be my favorite" (orders most often)
5. **Short Loin** (Porterhouse & T-bone) - "Advanced level home butchery"

---

## Essential Equipment

### Tools Required
- Large chef's knife (sharp, well-maintained)
- Boning knife (thin blade, pointy tip, ideally flexible)
- Meat saw (for short loin with bone)
- Large cutting board

### Organization System
- **Tray 1**: Final portioned steaks
- **Tray 2**: Beef fat trimmings (for rendering tallow)
- **Tray 3**: Meat trimmings (stir fry, mince, etc.)
- **Tray 4**: Silver skin and gristle (dog food)

---

## 1. Sirloin (New York Strip)

### Names
- Sirloin
- New York strip
- Strip loin
- Porterhouse (Australian term - Andy disagrees with this)

### Yield from One Sirloin
- **11 steaks** (300-350g each, roughly 2 fingers thick)
- 10 for eating, 1 for immediate lunch
- Beef fat for rendering into tallow
- Some trim meat
- Silver skin for dog

### Key Techniques

**The Chain**:
- Piece running along one side
- Restaurant: Remove it (looks messy)
- Home: Can leave it on
- Save for trim pile, not wasted

**Silver Skin Removal**:
- Run knife point under silver skin
- Point knife up slightly
- Pull off with minimal meat attached
- Tough to chew, won't hurt you, just unpleasant
- Dog gets it (Andy's dog named "Duck")

**Fat Cap Management**:
- Can trim whole OR per steak (Andy prefers per steak)
- Better control on expensive meat
- Want even fat cap for even rendering
- Big lumps render unevenly

**Portioning**:
- Start at "clean end" (opposite from ribeye connection)
- Square off edge first (clean starting face)
- 300-350g steaks = roughly 2 fingers thick
- Can cut 600g for roast
- Can cut thin minute steaks
- End pieces: Save for medium-well orders (more connective tissue, needs time)

### Cost Savings
Half the price vs buying 4-5 pre-cut steaks

---

## 2. Fillet (Tenderloin)

### Names
- Fillet
- Tenderloin
- Eye fillet
- Filet mignon
- Chateaubriand (center cut)
- "Lots of names, I just call it beef fillet"

### Anatomy
- **Head**: Thick end
- **Center cut/Chateaubriand**: Middle section (for Beef Wellington)
- **Tail**: Thin end

### Andy's Specimen
- Carrara Wagyu fillet (not Flax-fed)
- "Might look different to what a lot of fillets look like"
- Usually super lean, this one highly marbled

### Yield
- **7 steaks** (6 nice + 1 smaller)
- Enough stir fry beef for two people (Andy + Caitlyn)
- Additional stir fry from cleaned chain
- Silver skin for dog (no fat to render - too lean)

### Key Techniques

**The Chain Removal**:
- Runs along one side
- Great stir fry meat when cleaned
- Very lean, cooks fast

**Head Processing**:
- Big sinew piece runs through
- Two options:
  1. Roast whole in pan, slice for two to share
  2. Split in two along seam, clean each side
- "When I was younger chef, tried to dig in there - don't do it, you'll ruin it"

**Tail Handling**:
- **Tricky part**: Spent a lot, end up with thin tail
- Don't push down to force thickness
- Trim real tail for stir fry
- Use next section as smaller steak
- Trim side piece (will overcook anyway)

**Stir Fry Meat**:
- Super lean
- Cooks nice and quick
- Andy jokes: "Stir fry a fillet steak in this economy? What are you crazy?"

---

## 3. Rump (Top Sirloin)

### Names
- Rump
- Top sirloin
- Bottom round
- Source of "rump cap" (Picanha)

### Why Start Here
> "I think this is a fantastic place to start your home butchery. I also think it's a really good value proposition if you've got a family."

**Reason**: Multiple different cuts for different purposes

### Yield from One Rump
- **1 whole picanha** (feeds 4)
- **3 large rump steaks** (feeds 4 - can split for kids)
- **Roast beef** for sandwiches (feeds 4, lasts 3-4 days in fridge)
- **Stir fry beef** (feeds at least 4)
- **500g+ rendered tallow**
- Bowl of dog food

### The Picanha (Rump Cap)

**Processing**:
- Find seam, pull apart (could literally pull by hand)
- Follow seam through fat cap
- Clean silver skin from bottom
- Trim fat cap to even thickness

**Uses**:
- Roast whole
- Reverse sear
- Cut for Brazilian-style skewers over charcoal
- Cut into steaks
- Andy has "heaps of videos about picanha"

**Hidden Snack**:
- Small muscle sometimes left attached
- "Really great snack... eats really well"
- Pan fry immediately

### Rump Steaks

**Fat Cap Method**:
- Use existing fat cap for orientation
- Cut with grain direction
- Big steaks (can halve if needed)
- Trim fat cap after cutting (Andy leaves aggressive amount)

**Family Portioning Example**:
- Steak 1: Andy
- Steak 2: Caitlyn
- Steak 3: Cut in half for two kids

### Sandwich Roast

**This section**: No fat cap, not ideal for steaks
- Clean completely (all silver skin and fat)
- Big seam in middle - follow it through
- Roast hot, lots of salt/pepper/steak seasoning
- Keep really rare
- Fridge overnight (lasts 3-4 days)
- Slice thin for sandwiches

### Stir Fry Beef
- Use all cleaned trim
- Remove any fat or sinew
- Already cut against grain (short fibers)
- If longer grain pieces, cut across grain

---

## 4. Ribeye (Scotch Fillet)

### Names
- Ribeye
- Scotch fillet (Australia)
- Cube roll
- Entrecôte (French)
- Source of tomahawk steaks (with bone)

### Andy's Take
> "Could be my favorite cut of steak. Well, the one I order the most. You can't have favorites, can you?"

### Anatomy
- **The Cap**: Tastiest part of the animal (runs along one side)
- **The Eye**: Center loin section
- **Fat eye**: Fat surrounding the loin

**Processing Note**: "Don't be tempted to pull that cap off" - keep it attached

### Yield
- **11 steaks** (350-400g, about 2 fingers thick)
- Little lunch piece
- Some stir fry trim
- Dog food
- Little bit of fat for rendering

### Key Techniques

**Rib Remnants**:
- Where ribs used to be attached to cap
- Boning knife removed ribs
- Usually bits of fat and sinew left behind
- Trim these off
- Sometimes very pronounced (worse than this specimen)
- "Like silver skin at another level - really tough, been hugging bone"

**Scoring from Abattoir**:
- Sometimes get score lines from processing
- "Not much you can do about it"
- Cosmetic issue mostly

**Fat Cap Assessment**:
- This one didn't have huge fat cap
- Plenty of fat inside already
- "Fat is flavor - absolutely agree"
- "But there is such a thing as too much of a good thing"

### Portioning Philosophy

**Thickness Matters**:
- 350-400g steaks
- Two fingers thick minimum
- **Critical insight**: "Those scrangly supermarket steaks about this thick - really hard to get good cuisson"
- Thin steaks = can't get both good crust AND proper inside temp

**Marbling Reality Check**:
> "This is not a really highly marbled steak and that is fine. There is nothing wrong with steaks that have this amount of marbling. We've kind of been spoiled lately on social media. Everyone shows these crazy marbled steaks all the time. I'm completely guilty of it myself, but this is the steak I grew up eating and there's nothing wrong with it."

## 5. Short Loin (Porterhouse & T-bone)

### Classification
> "This is advanced level home butchery. Let's just start by saying that."

### Anatomy
- **Big end**: Eye fillet (tenderloin)
- **Small end**: Beginning of ribeye (can see cap starting)
- **Bone**: T-shaped
- **Sirloin side**: Butts up against sirloin subprimal

### Porterhouse vs T-bone

**Technical Definition**:
- **Porterhouse**: At least 2.5cm (1+ inch) of fillet at bone
- **T-bone**: Around 1cm (1/2 inch) or less of fillet at bone
- Same piece of meat, difference is fillet size

**Why Some Australians Are Wrong**:
Andy doesn't agree with calling sirloin "porterhouse" because real porterhouse is this cut with substantial fillet section.

### Special Equipment
**Meat saw required** - can't do this cut without one

### Yield from One Short Loin
- **Porterhouse sections** (biggest fillet pieces)
- **T-bone sections** (medium fillet pieces)
- **Sirloin on bone** (minimal/no fillet - "strip loin on bone")

### Advanced Technique

**Knife First, Saw Second**:
1. Cut as much as possible with knife
2. Only use saw for bone
3. "Don't cut muscle with saw - makes horrible job, no one likes that"

**Portioning**:
- Andy aimed for ~1kg steaks (ended up 1.2-1.6kg)
- "Without bone, probably about a kilo"
- Cut through meat on both sides first
- Then saw through bone
- Clean up bone dust and scraggly bits

**Face Flattening**:
- If using band saw: flatten first
- Hand sawing: don't bother

### Cooking Method
**Reverse Sear**:
- Barbecue, bring to temp slowly
- Crank BBQ as hot as possible
- Seal outside for good crust
- Best for large bone-in cuts

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Savings
- **Ribeye example**: Half price vs buying 4-5 pre-cut steaks
- Control over thickness (supermarket steaks "too thin")
- No waste (everything has a use)

### Value Beyond Money
1. **Cuisson control** - Get both crust and proper doneness
2. **Thickness control** - 2+ fingers vs thin supermarket cuts
3. **Multiple cuts from one subprimal** - Variety for family
4. **Learn valuable skill** - Butchery fundamentals
5. **Quality time** - Can be meditative/enjoyable
6. **Dog benefits** - Free high-quality dog food from trim

---

## Universal Butchery Principles

### Seam Butchery
- Feel for natural seams between muscles
- "You could literally pull this apart"
- Follow seams with knife
- Work with meat's structure, not against it

### Silver Skin Management
- Thin, tough membrane covering muscles
- Point knife under it, angle up
- Run across pulling away
- Want minimal meat attached when removed
- Chewy but not harmful if consumed

### Fat Handling
- Save all fat trimmings separately
- Render into tallow (best cooking fat for steaks)
- Cut small for faster rendering
- Add cup of water to pot, medium heat
- When water evaporates, lower to low heat
- Render until clear/slightly golden

### Trim Management
**Four destinations**:
1. **Steaks** - Prime cuts
2. **Stir fry** - Lean, small pieces
3. **Mince** - Fat/meat combination (burgers, Bolognese)
4. **Dog food** - Silver skin, gristle

### Grain Direction
- Always cut across grain for tenderness
- Grain direction varies by muscle
- Short grain = already tender across grain
- Long grain = must cut perpendicular

---

## Rendering Tallow (Beef Fat)

### Process
1. Cut all fat trimmings small
2. Pot with 1 cup water, medium heat
3. Wait for complete water evaporation
4. Lower to low heat
5. Render until clear, slightly golden color

### Why Render
> "We all know [beef fat] is the best thing to cook steaks in."

**Uses**:
- Cooking steaks (optimal flavor)
- General high-heat cooking
- Traditional cooking fat

---

## Stir Fry Meat Processing

### Sources
- Fillet chain (very lean)
- Fillet head trim
- Rump trim
- Various muscle trim

### Technique
**Hand Mincing** (if no mincer):
- Cut one direction
- Turn 90°, cut other direction
- Chunkier than machine, but works
- "Takes a bit of work"

**Grain Awareness**:
- If already short grain, cut as-is
- If long grain, cut across grain

### Quality
- Super lean (from fillet especially)
- Cooks fast
- High quality (would cost fortune as separate product)

---

## Special Cuts & Uses

### Picanha (Rump Cap)
- Brazilian-style skewers over charcoal
- Reverse sear whole
- Cut into steaks
- Roast whole
- Andy has dedicated picanha videos

### Roast Beef (from Rump)
- Section without fat cap
- Roast hot and rare
- Refrigerate overnight

- Save for medium-well orders (more cooking time)
- Personal consumption
- Minute steaks (thin cut)

### The Cap (Ribeye)
- Tastiest part of animal
- Keep attached to ribeye
- End piece with mostly cap = immediate lunch
- "Salt and whack it on the barbie"

## Andy's Teaching Style

### Honest Assessment
- "I haven't done this in a while"
- Admits when cut is imperfect
- "A little bit rough if I'm perfectly honest"
- Shares mistakes in real-time

### Relatable Language
- "We're not barbarians" (when could pull meat apart)
- "I sound like a 10-year-old boy at the bus station" (saying "cap" repeatedly)
- "What are you crazy?" (fillet stir fry joke)
- Dog named "Duck" (recurring character)

### Australian Context
- References to Australian terminology
- Mentions Caitlyn (partner)
- Barbecue culture
- Local meat standards

### Encouragement
> "I know it might seem a bit daunting, but it's not that hard once you do it a few times."

---

## Social Media Reality Check

### Marbling Expectations
> "We've kind of been spoiled lately on social media. Everyone kind of shows these crazy marbled steaks all the time. And I'm completely guilty of it myself, but this is the steak I grew up eating and there's nothing wrong with it."

**Message**: Normal marbling is fine, don't chase Instagram-level marbling

### Supermarket Steak Critique
- Too thin for proper cuisson
- Hard to get both crust and proper doneness
- "Even though they're called premium and beef is good quality"
- Thickness matters more than fancy labeling

---

## Practical Application Guide

### For Beginners
**Start with**: Rump
- "Fantastic place to start home butchery"
- Good value proposition
- Multiple different uses
- Forgiving to work with

### For Intermediate
**Progress to**:
1. Sirloin - Straightforward, single muscle
2. Ribeye - Similar to sirloin, slightly easier
3. Fillet - More expensive, practice on cheaper cuts first

### For Advanced
**Master**: Short loin
- Requires meat saw
- Bone cutting complexity
- High cost of errors
- Most impressive result

---

## Cost Breakdown Estimates

### Single Subprimal Purchase
- **Sirloin**: 11 steaks vs buying 4-5 pre-cut = 50% savings
- **Ribeye**: Half price for same yield
- **Rump**: Best value - multiple products from one purchase

### Hidden Value
1. Rendered tallow (would cost extra to buy)
2. Stir fry meat (expensive if purchased separately)
3. Roast beef prep (deli-quality at home)
4. Dog food (high-quality, free)
5. Learning experience (priceless skill)

---

## Equipment Investment

### Minimum Required
- Good chef's knife: $50-150
- Boning knife: $30-80
- Large cutting board: $40-100
- **Total**: ~$120-330 one-time investment

### Advanced Addition
- Meat saw: $20-50 (only for short loin)

### Returns
- Pay for itself after 2-3 subprimals
- Lifetime skill development
- Better quality control

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Surface moisture** - "If it's sliding around, it's dangerous. Dry it really well."
2. **Cutting with saw through meat** - "Makes horrible job, no one likes that"
3. **Over-trimming fillet head** - "Don't dig in there, you'll ruin it"
4. **Pulling cap off ribeye** - "Don't be tempted"
5. **Supermarket thickness** - Too thin for proper cuisson
6. **Too much "good thing"** - Even fat needs balance

---

## Integration with Self-Sufficiency

### Food Preparedness Value
- Buy in bulk when prices low
- Portion and freeze
- Control quality
- Reduce dependence on retail
- Valuable barter skill
- Teaches animal anatomy

### Economic Resilience
