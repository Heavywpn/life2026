## Overview: Three Critical Off-Grid Systems

When starting an off-grid homestead, these three systems should be your top priority:
1. **Power** (Off-grid solar)
2. **Food** (Garden/orchard with long onramp)
3. **Water** (Collection, storage, and distribution)

While shelter, community, security, and resources are important, these three were the first focus areas and are considered the most critical.

## SYSTEM 1: OFF-GRID SOLAR POWER

### Why Power is Critical
- Most people equate "off-grid" with being off the electricity grid
- One of the most significant systems you'll implement
- Saves money long-term
- Reduces dependency on energy monopolies
- Gives control and responsibility over a large aspect of off-grid living
- For this property: nearest power line is 1km away

### Positioning Considerations

**Solar Panel Placement:**
- Balance between best sun exposure and proximity to home
- Don't skimp on either placement consideration
- Home should be in best position for outlook, warmth, view
- Solar should capture maximum solar energy

**Cable Run Costs:**
- 50m run from solar to home = $1,000 just for cable alone
- This property has two 50m runs (one to each family)
- Budget for mains electrical run costs upfront

### Housing the Components

**Initial Setup (Don't Do This):**
- Started with a "wheelie bin shed" from Bunnings (~$350)
- Too small, cramped to work in
- Overheated in spring/summer (despite working fine in winter)

**Current Setup:**
- Added carport over the small shed
- Solved heat problems
- Still not ideal

**Future Upgrade Plans:**
- Skin the carport outside with Colorbond
- Insulate walls
- Plywood paneling inside for mounting gear
- Possibly add AC unit to maintain 20-25°C
- **Lesson: Think bigger than you think you need - you want room to move**

**Climate Control:**
- Optimal temperature: 20-25°C
- Batteries rated to 50°C, but 20-25°C preserves gear longer
- Plan for climate control from the start

**Vermin Proofing (Critical!):**
- Seal every gap with gap filler/expander foam
- Add fly screen mesh in ventilation areas
- **Lesson Learned:** A frog crawled into a component and shorted it out = $2,000 replacement cost
- Whatever space you build, climate control AND vermin-proof it

### Component Specifications

#### BATTERIES (Biggest Mistake)

**Their Setup:**
- 48V system
- 200 amp hour, 24V batteries (actually 25.6V)
- Two sets of two batteries = 400 amp total
- Calculation: 400 amp × 50V = 20 kWh storage
- Cost at time: ~$2,000 each = $8,000 for four batteries
- Current cost: ~$1,600 each

**The Problem:**
- Calculated for 4-5 people, now have 7 people on site
- Can only go about one day without supplementary power (generator)
- **Should have gone with 600 amp (six batteries instead of four)**
- Additional cost would have been ~$3,000 more

**Lesson: Always go MORE than you think on batteries**

**Backup Power Solution:**
- Replaced generator with Blue Eddy Apex 300 + expansion battery
- Sits with own solar panels trickle charging
- Can dump power back into main system when needed

#### INVERTER (Smart Decision - Oversized)

**Their Setup:**
- Maximum load calculated: 3-4 KVA
- Installed: 10 KVA inverter
- **Doubled their calculated need**

**Why This Was Smart:**
- Never seen system go above 4-4.5 kW even with everything running
  - All pumps on
  - Showers running
  - Heaters on
  - Everything simultaneously
- Leaves capacity for future expansion:
  - Big shed
  - Sawmill
  - Welders
  - Large power tools

**Lesson: Double your calculated max load for future expansion**

#### SOLAR CHARGE CONTROLLER (Smart Decision - Oversized)

**Their Setup:**
- MPPT 450/100 model
- Can handle 450 volts × 2 (two strings/arrays)
- Can output 100 amps
- "Just huge" capacity

**Why This Was Smart:**
- Started with 20 secondhand 190W solar panels
- Doubled to 40 panels already
- Can still add many more panels
- Future upgrade: Replace 190W panels with 270W panels as they become available cheap

**Solar Panel Strategy:**
- Started with cheap/free secondhand panels
- This is where you CAN afford to skimp
- Got panels "for free or next to free"
- Find old panels on Gum Tree, Facebook Marketplace
- People rip old systems off roofs - panels available cheap or free
- 270W panels "coming right down" in price

**Lesson: Oversize your solar charge controller for massive future expansion**

### Key Power System Principles

1. **Think Future Expansion** - Spec up for what you might need in 5-10 years
2. **Most gear lasts 10+ years** - Investment pays off over time
3. **Oversize inverter and charge controller** - Worth the extra cost
4. **Batteries: Go bigger than calculated** - Account for life changes
5. **Solar panels: Buy cheap/secondhand** - They work fine and save money
6. **Housing: Build bigger than you think** - You need room to work
7. **Climate control from day one** - Preserves equipment life
8. **Vermin-proof everything** - One frog = $2,000 lesson

### Regulations Warning

- Rules changed significantly even since their installation
- Always needed electrician for mains electrical work
- Now certifications/compliance required for solar side too
- **Check rules for your specific area before starting**

## SYSTEM 2: FOOD SECURITY

### Why Food Belongs in Top 3

**Longest Onramp of All Systems:**
- 12-24 months before meaningful harvest from your property
- The sooner you start, the sooner first harvest comes
- Not about getting plants in ground first
- It's about soil preparation

### Soil First, Plants Second

**Day One Priority: COMPOST**
- Don't shape garden beds yet
- Don't clear areas yet
- Don't even plant yet
- **Start composting immediately**

**Why Compost First:**
- Best way to improve soil productivity
- Increases overall nutrition for plants
- Gather natural resources, green waste
- Begin composting process from day one

### The Learning Curve

**What You Can Grow vs. What You Like to Eat:**
- May have to change your diet
- What you can grow depends on:
  1. Your skills (changeable)
  2. Your climate (not easily changeable)

**Climate Reality Check:**
- Their experience: Gardened for 10 years in subtropical region
- Moved to temperate semi-arid region
- Everything they could grow previously changed
- **Learning what grows in YOUR area is critically important**

**Learning to Eat from Your Garden:**
- Huge challenge beyond just growing
- You eat what grows, when it grows
- Requires menu/diet adaptation

### Water Dependency

**Gardens Depend on Water System:**
- Must address water issues for gardens immediately
- Their challenges:
  - Water salinity problems
  - Evaporation issues
  - Irrigation systems from subtropical climate don't work in semi-arid
- Still tweaking and changing setup after 2 years

### Key Food System Principles

1. **Start composting on day one** - Before anything else
2. **Soil health = plant health** - Invest in soil first
3. **Climate dictates crops** - Research what grows in your region
4. **12-24 month timeline** - Plan for long onramp
5. **Adapt your diet** - Eat what grows locally
6. **Water is essential** - Garden success depends on water access

## SYSTEM 3: WATER

### Why Water is Critical

**Water is the Lifeblood:**
- Humans need it: drinking, bathing, washing
- Animals need it
- Livestock needs it
- Gardens need it
- Landscape needs it
- "All-important resource"

### Three Ways to Collect Water

#### 1. Rooftop Rainwater Collection

**Pros:**
- Quick and easy if you have sloped roof
- Very efficient collection
- Straight into tank

**Their Situation:**
- Not currently using (infrastructure based on shipping containers)
- Upcoming project: Add roof to tiny home this spring
- Will implement then

**Best For:** Properties with existing roofed structures

#### 2. Dams (Catchment Ponds)

**Their Setup:**
- 150-acre property came with two massive dams
- Total capacity: ~5 million liters
- Currently holding: ~2 million liters (low rainfall year)

**Pros:**
- Massive water storage capacity
- If property already has dams, water collection is sorted

**Cons:**
- At mercy of rainfall to fill
- At mercy of evaporation stealing water

**Evaporation Reality:**
- Height of summer: Lost ~40,000L/day to evaporation
- That's 8mm off surface every single day
- With lily coverage: Now losing ~10,000L/day
- **Still huge loss**

**Usage vs. Loss:**
- Use ~2,000L/day (7 people + gardens + animals)
- At current levels: ~1,000 days of water
- But losing 10,000L/day to evaporation
- "Really hoping for rain"

**Evaporation Mitigation:**
- Lily coverage helps significantly
- As dam volume decreased, lilies spread toward center
- Reduced evaporation from 40,000L to 10,000L per day

#### 3. Bore Water (Well Water)

**The Critical Lesson: TALK TO NEIGHBORS FIRST**

**Their Expensive Mistake:**
- Drilled to 40m, found water
- Went to 100m "to be safe"
- Cost: $100/meter = $10,000 for bore
- **Result: High salinity - largely unusable**

**Impact of Salinity:**
- Can drink it (unusual - they can filter most salt out)
- **Cannot use for gardening** (salt kills plants)
- Won't give to livestock (health concerns)
- Relying entirely on dam/rain water now

**What They Should Have Done:**
- Neighbor 400m away has bore at 150m depth
- Totally drinkable, non-salty water
- **If they'd asked neighbors first, would have known about salt issues**

**The Dilemma:**
- Can't easily re-drill a bore
- Options:
  1. Drill second bore at 150m+ depth = $15,000+
  2. Expensive reverse osmosis filtration
  3. Weighing costs of both options

**Reverse Osmosis Considerations:**
- Costly equipment
- Wastes significant water
- Might still be cheaper than second bore

**Lesson: Talk to locals and neighbors with bores BEFORE drilling**

### Two Ways to Manage Water

#### 1. Water Storage

**Dams:**
- Can hold millions of liters
- Battle evaporation
- Need constant rain supply
- Dry years = noticeable depletion

**Tanks:**
- Their setup: Two tanks = 40,000L total
- Limited compared to dams (5 million vs 40,000)
- For them: ~2-3 weeks of water

**Strategic Tank Placement:**
- Positioned up the hill
- Allows gravity feed to systems
- Benefits:
  1. Not always using electric pump
  2. Not draining solar power to move water
  3. Gravity feeds pumps that supply sheds, home, gardens

#### 2. Moving Water Around Property

**Requirements:**
- Pipe work
- Pumps

**Their Implementation:**
- 150m pipe run to bring water up to poly tanks
- Two 5,000-gallon (20,000L) tanks
- Total cost: ~$6,000 for pipe work and tanks

**Critical Advice: Talk to Local Experts**
- Local rural store
- Local pump and irrigation specialist
- "Talked their ears off"
- Experts helped design the system
- Purchased tanks and pipe work through them
- **Prevented costly mistakes**

**DIY vs. Professional Work:**
- **Allowed to DIY:** Rural water systems
  - Dam to tanks
  - Tanks to water troughs
  - Tanks to gardens
  - Any non-domestic water work
- **Must Be Certified:** Domestic supply
  - Your home
  - Tiny home
  - Cottage
  - Anything connected to human habitation

**Note:** Check local regulations - he's "not a legal expert" but this is general rural water rule

### Key Water System Principles

1. **Three collection methods:** Rooftop, dams, bore/well
2. **Talk to neighbors before drilling bore** - Critical to avoid salinity issues
3. **Dams = massive storage but evaporation loss is real** - 10,000-40,000L/day
4. **Tank placement matters** - Gravity feed saves power and complexity
5. **Budget for pipe work** - $6,000 for 150m run + tanks
6. **Consult local experts** - Rural stores and irrigation specialists
7. **DIY what you legally can** - Rural water allowed, domestic requires certified plumber
8. **Lily coverage reduces evaporation** - Natural solution to water loss
