## STRUCTURED SUMMARY

### Main Topics & Key Points

#### I. Visceral Fat & Insulin Resistance
- Belly fat (visceral fat) indicates hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance
- Visceral fat is highly inflammatory, producing interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, and elevated CRP
- This fat accumulates around organs (liver, pancreas, heart) and is called "ectopic fat"
- Different from subcutaneous fat (e.g., buttocks) which is less inflammatory
- Can be detected via CT scans showing inflammation around coronary arteries

#### II. Fasting vs. Calorie Restriction
**Fasting:**
- Lowers insulin levels
- Preserves muscle mass
- Targets visceral fat first
- Maintains metabolic rate

**Calorie Restriction:**
- Slows metabolism
- Breaks down both muscle and fat
- Body senses deficit and adapts negatively

**Key Difference:** Fasting triggers different physiology designed for fat mobilization from storage (using "deposit account")

#### III. Fasting Physiology Timeline
- **First 12 hours:** Body uses glycogen from muscles and liver
- **After 12 hours:** Fat burning begins, visceral fat targeted first
- Insulin levels drop significantly, allowing fat mobilization
- Ketone production begins

#### IV. Ketosis & Ketones
- **What are ketones?** Energy molecules produced by the liver from fat
- **Process:** Low insulin → fat release → free fatty acids → liver converts to ketones
- **Benefits:**
  - Cleaner fuel source than glucose (produces less reactive oxygen species)
  - Increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
  - Better cognition, reflexes, and visual acuity
  - Enhanced mental clarity
- **Important:** Not meant to stay in ketosis permanently - cycling is essential

#### V. Additional Benefits of Fasting

**Stem Cell Mobilization:**
- Surge upon breaking fast
- Improves immunity (less infections, colds, viruses)
- Progenitor cells repair blood vessel lining
- Particularly important for vascular health

**Growth Hormone Increase:**
- Peaks during fasting
- Best time to exercise is near end of fast
- Fastest way to increase natural GH production
- Helps retain and build muscle

**Autophagy (Cellular Recycling):**
- Cells sense no new nutrients coming in
- Breaks down redundant organelles
- Packages and exports cellular waste
- Creates new, efficient mitochondria
- Results in improved energy and reduced fatigue
- Toxin removal from cells

**Improved Mitochondrial Function:**
- More ATP production
- Less oxidative stress
- Better cellular signaling
- New protein and molecule production

## ACTIONABLE ADVICE

### Fasting Protocols (Progressive Approach)

#### Beginners / General Weight Loss
1. **Start with 12:12**
   - 12 hours eating, 12 hours fasting
   - Duration: 2-3 weeks

2. **Progress to 18:6**
   - 6-hour eating window
   - 18-hour fast
   - Most sustainable long-term

**Allowed during fasting:**
- Water
- Black coffee
- Black tea
- Green tea
- NO CALORIES

#### Significant Weight Loss / Diabetes Reversal
- **OMAD (One Meal A Day)** for 9 consecutive days
- Followed by **72-hour water fast**
- Repeat cycle
- Alternative: **48-hour fast** once per week

#### Maintenance (Healthy Individuals)
- **18:6** time-restricted feeding regularly
- **36-hour fast** at least once per month
- This should be standard practice for normal healthy people

#### Extended Fasting (Medical Supervision REQUIRED)
- 72+ day fasts for severe obesity, diabetes, hypertension
- **Required supplements:**
  - Daily electrolytes (Element brand or Celtic salt - ½ teaspoon in water once daily)
  - MCT oil for cravings (1 teaspoon in water as needed)

### Exercise Timing & Strategy

**Optimal Timing:**
- Exercise near the **peak of your fast**
- Example: If breaking fast at 6 PM, exercise at 4 PM
- Growth hormone peaks during fasting
- Optimal for muscle building and retention

**Best Exercise Types While Fasted:**
- Resistance training (weights)
- HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)
- Brief, intense muscle work with rest periods

**Avoid While Fasted:**
- Long aerobic sessions (40+ minutes)
- Extended cardio, especially for women
- May lead to muscle breakdown and glucose depletion

### Diet Cycling Strategy

1. **Weight Loss Phase:**
   - Use ketogenic diet (<50g carbs/day)
   - Continue until reaching goal weight

2. **Maintenance Phase:**
   - Shift to 18:6 time-restricted feeding
   - Don't stay in ketosis permanently
   - Cycle in and out of ketogenic states

3. **Long-term Health:**
   - Continue intermittent monthly 36-hour fasts
   - Maintain fasting as normal part of physiology

### Early Intervention

- Insulin resistance begins around **age 30**
- Start fasting protocols early to prevent metabolic damage
- Monitor for visceral fat accumulation (protruding belly)
- People with belly fat will gain 5-10 lbs on cruise (high insulin = storage mode)
- Harder to lose weight with hyperinsulinemia

## DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Fasting Protocols - Complete Breakdown

| Protocol | Eating Window | Fasting Period | Best For | Duration | Notes |
|----------|---------------|----------------|----------|----------|-------|
| **12:12** | 12 hours | 12 hours | Beginners, adaptation | 2-3 weeks | Starter phase |
| **18:6** | 6 hours | 18 hours | General health, maintenance | Indefinite | Most sustainable |
| **OMAD** | ~1 hour | 23 hours | Moderate weight loss | Daily or cycling | Can be done continuously |
| **36-hour** | None | 36 hours | Monthly maintenance | Once monthly minimum | Recommended for all healthy people |
| **48-hour** | None | 48 hours | Diabetes reversal | Weekly | For severe metabolic issues |
| **72-hour** | None | 72 hours | Obesity, metabolic disease | Every 9 days | Cycle with OMAD |
| **72+ days** | None | Extended (months) | Severe cases ONLY | As needed | **Requires medical supervision** |

### Women's Health - Detailed Considerations

#### Areas of General Agreement
- Fasting protocols work for most women
- Resistance training and HIIT are well-tolerated during fasting
- Avoid long aerobic sessions (40+ min) while fasted
- Same basic protocols can be applied to both genders

#### Conflicting Expert Perspectives

**Dr. in Video Position:**
- "Women are not that different when it comes to fasting programs"
- Successfully fasted female patients with same protocols as men
- Observes similar results across genders
- Has supervised 72-day female fasts with excellent outcomes

**Dr. Stacy Sims Position (Referenced in discussion):**
- Women's hypothalamus is more glucose-sensitive
- Will break down muscle if insufficient glucose during workouts
- Body defends pregnancy potential
- May shut down menstrual cycle if energy-stressed
- Recommends eating before workouts for women

#### Exceptions - Who Should NOT Fast
Both sources agree these women should avoid fasting:
- Women trying to conceive
- Pregnant women
- (Implied: Breastfeeding women)

#### Practical Resolution Strategy
1. **Start conservatively:** Begin with 12:12 or 18:6
2. **Monitor carefully:** Track menstrual cycle regularity
3. **Exercise choice:** Prefer resistance/HIIT over long cardio while fasted
4. **Individual adjustment:** Consider eating small amount before workouts if experiencing issues
5. **Listen to your body:** Individual response varies significantly
6. **Medical guidance:** Seek supervision for extended fasts

## SCIENTIFIC MECHANISMS EXPLAINED

### Why Fasting Works Differently Than Calorie Restriction

**Hormonal Response:**
- **Fasting:** Insulin drops → fat mobilization increases → metabolic rate maintained
- **Calorie Restriction:** Body senses deficit → metabolic rate slows → muscle breakdown occurs

**Metabolic State:**
- **Fasting:** "Withdrawal from deposit account" (using stored fat)
- **Calorie Restriction:** General breakdown of available tissues

### The Feast-Fast Cycle (Evolutionary Design)

**Historical Context:**
- Modern humans only feast (industrialized living)
- Lost the fasting physiology
- Genetics and physiology haven't adapted to constant feeding
- Fasting-feasting cycle is our natural design
- Modern lifestyle is a "fraction of a millisecond" in human evolution

**Why We Still Have Fasting Physiology:**
- Supposed to serve essential purpose
- Normal part of human existence
- Provides survival advantages when activated
- Explains why it produces beneficial effects

### Ketone Production & Utilization

**Process:**
1. Fasting reduces insulin
2. Fat cells release free fatty acids
3. Free fatty acids travel to liver
4. Liver converts them to ketones
5. Ketones become alternative fuel to glucose

**Two Energy Systems:**
- **Glucose metabolism** - Primary in fed state
- **Ketone metabolism** - Primary in fasted state
- Body designed to use both ("current account and deposit account")

### Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)

**What it does:**
- Promotes growth of new brain cells
- Improves reflexes
- Enhances visual acuity
- Increases cognitive function

**Why it increases during fasting:**
- Evolutionary advantage
- "Nature wants you to become a better specimen"
- Helps you "go out and get your next kill"
- Survival mechanism activation

### Autophagy Process

**Cellular Level Events:**
1. Cell senses no new nutrients
2. Identifies redundant/damaged organelles
3. Breaks down old components
4. Packages waste into packets
5. Exports waste from cells
6. Creates new, efficient organelles

**Mitochondrial Autophagy:**
- Old mitochondria replaced
- New mitochondria more efficient
- Increased ATP production
- Reduced reactive oxygen species
- Less oxidative damage

**Result:**
- All cells function more efficiently
- Improved energy levels
- Reduced fatigue
- Better cellular signaling
- Enhanced protein production

### Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)

**What they are:**
- Byproducts of metabolism
- Produced by mitochondria
- Can damage cellular components

**Ketone advantage:**
- Ketone metabolism produces less ROS
- Cleaner fuel source
- Less cellular damage
- Better long-term health

**Mitochondrial signaling:**
- ROS aren't just waste products
- Send signals to chromosomes
- Influence protein and molecule production
- Affect overall metabolism

## FULL TRANSCRIPT

[Complete transcript follows below]

in someone like me. I'm 33 years old
now. When does the damage begin?
>> It starts right now. It starts right
now. As soon as you around 30, you're
already starting to have trouble. You
have to But you know, this is what I do.
I look at that patient walking into my
room and if I see that he's got a belly
sticking out, I already know he's
probably got insulin resistance because
all the fat is in here. Because the fat
that's in the stomach sideways, he looks
terrible. From the back, he looks great.
His waist is increased.
>> He doesn't have all the fat everywhere
else in his body. That's the phenotype
of somebody who has hyperinsulinemia.
That same person goes on a cruise, he'll
come back 5 to 10 pounds more because
he's got so much insulin in his body.
Insulin is a storage molecule. Puts
everything away. And it's very hard for
him to lose weight.
>> Why is it harder?
>> You The only thing that will make you
lose that fat very quickly is to change
your diet, of course, but you have to do
fasting because fasting brings your
insulin level. See, this is where
fasting comes in. So, what does fasting
do?
>> Do you mean fasting or a calorie
deficit? Is it or is it the same thing
in your view? No, they're not the same
thing. They are not the same thing. You
see, when you don't eat, your insulin
levels come down because you not
stimulating your pancreas anymore. So,
you want to bring your insulin levels
down, the best thing you can do in the
world is to do fasting because there's
no look, if I just simply cut down on my
calories,
then there's a different physiology
that's going to take place in the body.
And when you fast, there's a totally
different physiology. When you cut down
on calories, the body senses that this
caloric deficit, your metabolic rate
changes, actually slows down. And the
body will start breaking down
everything, muscles included. So you
lose fat and you also lose muscles. On
the other hand, when you're fasting,
it's a different physiology. Fasting is
I've put on fat. Now I'm going to take
it out of the bank. Now the bank is
going to be available for me to pull out
my calories and use it now. And you
start burning the fat. So in the first
12 hours of a fast, you take out all the
glucose in the form of glycogen from
your muscles and your liver. After 12
hours, you start pulling the fat out.
And the first place the fat comes out of
is going to be visceral fat. That is why
fasting benefits you so much because it
gets rid of that worst fat, the fat that
is very inflammatory. You see if I did a
biopsy of your visceral fat versus a
biopsy of let's say a fat form on your
buttock.
>> Mhm.
>> Two different types of fat. One is full
of inflammatory molecules. The other one
is not full of inflammatory molecules.
One is producing interlucan 6 and tumor
necrosis factor and this other fat is
not. These are two different fat
stoages.
Visceral fat is very toxic. It's very
inflammatory.
And that is why patients who have
visceral fat make all these molecules.
So when I do the blood test I see that
oh you've got so much inflammation.
You've got interlucan 6 is high tumor
necrosis factor is high your CRP is
running high. And one of the reasons for
this is not just leaky gut and other
things that I look at. But in your case
it is also because you have a lot of
ectopic fat. Ectopic fat. Ectopic fat is
now we're realizing is not just only
around the liver and around your
pancreas, it's also around your heart.
So when we look at the coronary arteries
and we see all those fat around the
coronary arteries, you had a very nice
diagram right there and you can see that
around each artery
there's that yellowess that yellow is
all plaque
fat. That's fat around that and it's
plaque forming. It's plaque forming. It
stimulates plaque. It's inflammatory.
And now we can do CT scans that will
actually detect how much inflammation is
in the fat around the arteries as well.
Ectopic fat is in the around the
coronary arteries. It's in your liver
and in your pancreas. And it is very
inflammatory. On this point of fasting,
so if you have someone come to you and
that, you know, they have that physique
where there's a bit more of that
protruding belly fat. You said that
fasting is a much better approach than
just sort of a calorie restriction. I
was looking at some studies that said
research shows that calorie deficits of
any kind can reduce visual fat, but
fasting will give it an edge because of
the insulin sensitivity stuff that you
talked about as well. What kind of fast
should one be doing? Because there's so
many different names for these fasts.
People do these 40-day water fasts and
they do intermittent fasting.
>> It's a great question. So, there are
many many different types of fasting
depending on your goal on what do you
want for that particular patient. So, if
a patient is just simply looking to
reduce his visceral fat, then I start
with 1212, which means 12 hours you
don't eat anything. You just drink
liquids with no calories in it. And then
12 hours is your feeding period. We
start with that and we do that for about
2 to 3 weeks. Then we quickly move to
186.
186 means 6 hours you get to eat. 18
hours it's only
water, black tea, black coffee, green
tea, no calories. 186.
186. And then that's one type of
fasting. Now if a patient is very
overweight, a patient has diabetes and
your goal is to reverse the diabetes,
the patient needs to lose 60 pounds,
then those patients have a special type
of need for them. I will take them to a
48 hour fast once a week. Sometimes I'll
go to a 3-day water fast every nine
days.
Every nine days you will do OMAD. OMAD
means one meal a day only every day for
9 days and then you're going to give me
a 3-day water fast.
>> Is the same advice applicable to women?
Because obviously they're contending
with a variety of hormone fluctuations
and estrogen and I know that the the
female body responds differently to
these kinds of stresses like fasts.
>> I've been asked that question so many
times from patients as well. Most of the
women can actually handle it. The only
women that cannot are those who are
trying to become pregnant or or they
have um or they already pregnant. I I
think that women are not that different
when it comes to the fasting programs.
So, in my experience, I've been able to
get women to fast. I just finished a
fast on one lady just now for 72 days.
72 days. She was terribly overweight.
She had diabetes. She had hypertension.
She had hypademia.
She was having hip replacements, knee
replacements, joint problems. She had
skin problems and we fasted her for 72
days.
>> What did she have in those 702 days in
terms of drinks, electrolytes, coffee,
what was she?
>> Great question. So, she would have black
tea, black coffee, water, and in the
water once a day I tell her to put some
electrolytes in there. So there's a
electrolyte called element or sometimes
I just tell to go buy some Celtic salt
and put half a teaspoon in there and
once a day you take that. If you get
cravings and you feel really really
hungry take some MCT oil, a teaspoon and
put it in your water and you can drink
that as well. I think it's worth saying
that probably you shouldn't try this at
home, ladies and gentlemen, because
obviously medical supervision is
critical here. But in the case of that
lady, what was the before and after of
that 72-day fast?
>> So, diabetes gone, blood pressure
normalized,
weight loss, tremendous weight loss. I
think she lost about 55 60 lbs. Wow.
>> Okay. And not only did she lose all that
weight, yes, all that weight from her
belly was gone, but even her face under
the arms. So when you lose weight in a
fasting program, it's very different
from losing weight when you are
restricting calories. You actually
retract your your skin. So you get real
changes in your entire body. these
patient I had one patient that fasted
for 183 days under supervision. Okay. So
he went from 400 lb to 210 lb. And when
he walked into the office you would not
recognize that he's just lost all this
weight because he did not look like skin
on top of bones and then having to have
surgery to remove all that excess skin.
Fasting is a totally different
physiology.
In fasting, you you you you the body is
doing a whole lot of things that are
very different. And we can go into the
physiology of fasting because that's
fascinating. It's a physiology that has
not been used by us. We've lost it. So,
one of the things about modern living,
modern living, we have lost this
physiology of fasting. First of all, why
do we still have that physiology in us?
It's because it's supposed to serve a
purpose. Cuz we're supposed to be
fasting and feasting. But now we only
feasting all the time and we're not
fasting
in order to go back to normal. You
should be fasting. Fasting is supposed
to be a normal part of your existence.
That's the way you were designed, not
this modern industrialized living that
we've been doing in the last fraction of
a millisecond in the total existence of
the human race. We've changed our
lifestyle so much. Modern man has. But
our genetics and our physiology has
lagged behind. We were supposed to use
fasting and feasting as part of our
normal program as our normal physiology.
That's why we still have it. That is why
after 12 hours you start making some
more ketones in your body and the
ketones come from fat. You're moving
that fat out of storage.
>> What is a ketone?
>> Ah ketones. So ketones are a energy
molecule produced by the liver. How does
it make it? it makes it from fat. So the
fat gets liberalized. And by the way,
the fats only start moving when your
insulin levels are down. So because of
fasting, your insulin levels are really
low now, okay? Because you've been
fasting, right? So now the fats start
dissolving. So you get free fatty acids.
The free fatty acids float into the
bloodstream. Free fatty acids are fat
products. They float into the
bloodstream. They go to your liver. Your
liver converts those into ketones. Now
ketones are an energy source of the
body. an alternative source to glucose.
So in general terms, you are either
going to be running on glucose and
glucose metabolism or you're running on
ketones.
Okay.
>> And so ketones basically show up in the
when glucose isn't around.
>> That's absolutely right. So ketones and
ketones are actually a cleaner fuel for
the body and in terms of producing
reactive oxygen species in the
metabolism. the way your mitochondria
work, you actually produce less reactive
oxygen species, which is damaging to
your physiology when you're in ketones.
And ketones are signaling molecules that
also change your physiology in a number
of ways. Number one, it causes the
production of brain derived neurotropic
factor that occurs under ketogenesis.
brain derived neurotropic factor which
means that you become smarter. You're
growing new cells. Your reflexes are
better. Your visual acuity is better.
Why? Because nature wants you to become
a better specimen so you can go out and
get your next kill.
>> So why don't we all just stay in a state
of ketosis then if it's so miraculous?
>> Well, that's a great question. You don't
want to be in ketosis all the time cuz
that's not what ketosis what what our
physiology was made for. because then
you'll just be burning fats, burning
fats, burning fats all the time and
that's not a good state to be in
constantly either. So you want to be
able to do both. You're supposed to get
your current account and your deposit
account. You're supposed to work with
both of them. That's the normal
physiology. So not only brain derived
neurotropic factor increases, but also
stem cells. Stem cells are amazing.
And in my patients, of course, I see
that
>> what what is a stem cell?
>> Stem cells. So stem cells are we all
have stem cells and we all still make
stem cells and they are produced by the
bone marrow. These are pur potent cells.
Cells made that will then go out and
become whatever they need to become. So
they can go out into your circulation,
become a muscle cell, they can become a
retinal cell, a skin cell. They can
transform into anything. So what happens
is that when you break your fast
you get a surge of stem cells coming out
of your bone marrow. Some of them become
immunosytes. That is why we know that
fasting also boosts your immunity.
People who fast get less infections, get
less sore throats and coughs and colds
and the viruses that are going around.
The immunity is better. The stem cells
are not I'm particularly interested in
the stem cells because of a thing called
the progentor cells endothelial
progentor cells. Progentor cells are you
see you're always hurting your blood
vessels the lining of the blood vessels
and the lining of your blood vessels
have to be constantly repaired and they
they are repaired by the progenitor
cells. When you do intermittent fasting
and timerestricted feeding, you will
produce more and this has been shown in
numerous studies, more progenitor cells.
And these progenitor cells go and repair
your blood vessels. So I do what? Why am
I interested in this? Because I'm a
vascular doctor. I want my blood vessels
to constantly be repairing themselves
from the damage that we do in day-to-day
life. So stem cell mobilization, brain
derived neurotropic factor. Growth
hormone, you make more growth hormone in
fasting.
So when should you exercise when you're
fasting? At the peak of your fast. So if
I'm going to break my fast at 6:00 p.m.,
I tell patients to go out to the gym at
4:00 in the afternoon.
But I said, "But doc, how can I do
that?" you will find that you will put
on more muscle and you'll retain more
muscle as well because you have higher
growth hormone. The fastest way and the
best way to actually increase your
growth hormone production is to do
intermittent fasting.
>> When I sat with um Dr. Stacy Sims who
does a lot lot of um work on women's
physiology and women's performance. One
of the things she said to me is that if
a woman in particular
tries to do a workout fasted, the body
will break down the muscle in a woman
because she said a woman's body is much
more the hippalamus is much more
sensitive to changes in a woman's
glucose levels because it's trying to
defend against you know pregnancy and
you know all these kinds of things. So
it shuts down the menstrual cycle if
there's not enough glucose in the blood
and and so she said for women in
particular you do you do want to have
eat something before you work out or it
will your body will take from the muscle
and it will definitely won't the body's
very sensitive. It won't want to help
you build muscle if there's not enough
glucose energy in the body. She said for
men it's slightly different because
we're a little bit more robust and we
were meant to hunt. So if we were
fasted, our body is, you know, designed
to kind of keep up its normal processes
to help us complete a hunt per se. So I
guess I throw this question out to you
about about women exercise and fasting.
>> Yeah, I think that's a great
observation. So again is what kind of
exercise is the woman doing? You see now
there's two kinds of basic exercises.
One is aerobic activity
>> and one is uh resistance exercises and
you can also throw into that
highintensity interval training. Mhm. So
when it comes to the training that I'm
talking about in a fasting state, I like
resistance training. So in resistance
training, that glucose issue is not
going to become a problem. Now, if
you're going to put that female patient
on a treadmill and make her run for a
long period of time, let's say you're
going to make a run for 40 minutes on
the treadmill, I think that yes, you're
absolutely right. You are going to
deplete her glucose and you may cause
some problems and then the muscle will
start breaking down. But I do believe
from all the experience that I've had
with my patients that when I tell them
to do HIT, which is high intensity
intel training, all the women do just as
well as the men because all you're doing
is you intensely working the muscles and
you're doing some resistance exercise
and then you're totally resting as well.
And I see fantastic results with that.
>> In terms of ketosis,
do you cycle in and out of a ketogenic
diet? And just for anyone that doesn't
know what know, a ketogenic diet is a
diet that's very very low in
carbohydrates. So less than 50 grams of
carbohydrates a day typically. Do you
cycle in and out of that diet?
>> Yes. Yes, you have to because I don't
want them to stay in a ketogenic state
all the time. So I do I do I do I tell
them look look what is your goal here?
What is your goal? If your goal is that
okay I need to lose 70 lbs then you're
going to do this till you get to your
goal. Once you get to your goal, then
you're going to go back to
timerestricted feeding, which means 186.
So, you'll still make some ketones. And
then intermittently, you can still do a
36-hour fast. That means normal healthy
people, you and me, we should still be
doing one 36-hour fast at least once a
month. So, we'll go to that. We'll go to
that. Fasting must still become part of
your pro, but you don't need to stay in
ketogenesis all the time. Remember also
that when you are in ketogenesis you are
you are also in autophagy.
How much autophagy can you do? That
means you recycling all your your partic
all your organels inside your cells.
>> What does that mean in simple terms for
someone that doesn't know the term or
>> so bottom line is the cell senses that
there is no new parts coming in here. So
it takes the redundant
organels inside the cells and breaks
them down, packages them up into these
little packets and exports them out of
the cells. So these cells, all your
cells in the body now are functioning at
a much more efficient level. So
mitochondria
also have autophagy. So you're getting
new mitochondria. You're repairing your
mitochondria. And you know it's all
about mitochondria, right? Your energy
mitochondria are those organs organels
inside each cell. And we just think of
them as only an energy source that oh
yeah my mitochondria they make ATP.
That's not the whole story. Yes, they
produce ATP, but they also produce this
thing called reactive oxygen species
and thereby they influence
the metabolism of your of your cell as
well. They send signals they send
signals to your to your chromosomes so
you start producing new proteins. You
start producing new molecules. So your
mitochondria are very important. If you
have old mitochondria, you're going to
have fatigue. tiredness. But when you
get mphagy, one reason why you feel so
good after a fast because you have new
mitochondria, they are much more
efficient in producing ATP and less
reactive oxygen species. So you have
mphagy, recycling of your parts,
cellular function improves, toxins get
out of your cells as well, toxins.
