# Home & Lifestyle Management

## Overview

This document tracks the transition to intentional, simplified living in the current home as empty nesters. The focus is on minimalism, automation, and quality over quantity.

**Decision (December 2025):** Staying in current home despite it being larger than needed for two people. Strategy: minimize possessions and automate maintenance to make the space manageable.

## Core Philosophy

### Guiding Principles

1. **Less stuff, always quality** - "Buy nice or buy twice"
2. **The process of doing simple things makes a better life** - Manual tasks done with intention
3. **Automate the mundane, engage with the meaningful** - Use technology for repetitive tasks
4. **Home Assistant integration required** - All automation must integrate with HA

### Creator Influences

| Creator | Philosophy Applied |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Christina Mychas** | 10 Minimalist Rules - intentional spending, "hell yes or no", declutter before organizing |
| **Gabe Bult** | 9 Minimalist Habits - clutter-free zones, 5-minute reset, 77% rule, phone-free zones |
| **Ben Vallack** | Unix philosophy - tools that do one thing well, quality over convergence |

---

## Current Status

### Living Situation
- **Home**: Large house, fully carpeted (white carpet)
- **Occupants**: 2 (empty nesters - boys no longer at home)
- **Challenge**: House too large for two people
- **Solution**: Minimalism + automation

## Minimalism Framework

## Decluttering Plan

### Priority Zones

| Zone | Priority | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Boys' old rooms | High | Pending | No longer occupied |
| Kitchen | High | Pending | Daily use, high visibility |
| Garage | Medium | Pending | Tool consolidation |
| Closets | Medium | Pending | Clothing audit |
| Storage areas | Low | Pending | After main areas done |

### Decluttering Process

1. **Choose zone** - One area at a time
2. **Remove everything** - Empty completely
3. **Joy/Use/Value test** - Each item must pass
4. **"Hell yes or no"** - Lukewarm = out
5. **Assign homes** - Everything has a place
6. **Maintain** - 5-minute daily reset

---

## Home Automation

### Requirements
- **All devices must integrate with Home Assistant**
- **Local control preferred** (privacy, reliability)
- **Reduce manual cleaning/maintenance effort**

### Automation Priorities

| Area | Priority | Solution | HA Integration | Status |
|------|----------|----------|----------------|--------|
| **Floor cleaning** | Critical | Robot vacuum | Required | Researching |
| Climate control | High | Smart thermostat | Required | TBD |
| Lighting | Medium | Smart switches/bulbs | Required | TBD |
| Security | Medium | Cameras, sensors | Required | TBD |
| Maintenance reminders | Low | HA automations | Native | TBD |

### Robot Vacuum Research

**Requirement:** Large home, fully carpeted (white), daily cleaning needed

**Top Candidates (HA Compatible):**

| Model | Suction | HA Integration | Price Range | Notes |
|-------|---------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| **Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra** | 10,000 Pa | Official integration | $$$$ | Best HA support |
| **Roborock Qrevo Curv** | 22,000 Pa | Official integration | $$$$ | Highest suction |
| **Dreame L40 Ultra** | 11,000 Pa | HACS custom | $$$ | Good for large homes |

**Decision:** Pending - researching best HA integration

**Note:** No robot vacuum supports true local-only control. All require cloud for initial setup.

## Quality Purchases Tracker

### Philosophy
- **Wishlist and wait** - Add to list, don't impulse buy
- **Research before buying** - Understand what "quality" means for this item
- **Buy nice or buy twice** - Invest in items that last
- **One in, one out** - Maintain equilibrium

### Purchases Log

| Item | Category | Status | Price | Quality Justification | Date |
|------|----------|--------|-------|----------------------|------|
| **Shapton Professional 1000 Grit Whetstone** | Tools | Ordered | ~$46 AUD | Japanese quality, splash-and-go, lifetime tool | Dec 2025 |
| Robot vacuum (TBD) | Automation | Researching | TBD | HA integration, daily use, white carpet | - |

### Wishlist (Waiting Period)

| Item | Category | Added | Why I Want It | Honest Assessment | Decision Date |
|------|----------|-------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| | | | | | |

### Future Considerations

| Item | Category | Purpose | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| Shapton 5000 grit | Tools | Polish stone for whetstone setup | Low | After learning 1000 grit |
| Leather strop | Tools | Final edge finishing | Low | After learning basics |
| Robot vacuum | Automation | Daily floor cleaning | High | Pending HA research |

## Skills to Develop

### Manual/Intentional Skills

| Skill | Status | Equipment | Guide Location |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Whetstone knife sharpening** | Equipment ordered (Mar 2026) | Shapton Pro 1000 | `skills/tools/whetstone-knife-sharpening.md` |

### Automation Skills

| Skill | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Home Assistant configuration | Existing | Expand for new devices |
| Robot vacuum integration | Pending | After purchase |
| Automation routines | Pending | Cleaning schedules, reminders |

---

## Maintenance Schedules

### Daily
- [ ] 5-minute reset (clutter-free zones)
- [ ] Robot vacuum run (when implemented)
- [ ] Kitchen cleanup

### Weekly
- [ ] Strop knives (when skill learned)
- [ ] Deep clean one zone
- [ ] Review automation logs

### Monthly
- [ ] Touch-up sharpen knives (3000 → 8000 → strop)
- [ ] Declutter audit (one area)
- [ ] HA system check

### Quarterly
- [ ] Full knife sharpening (1000 → progression)
- [ ] Major declutter session
- [ ] Quality purchase review (wishlist)

## Integration with Survival Project

### How This Supports Preparedness

1. **Financial resilience** - Quality purchases last, reduce long-term costs
2. **Skill development** - Manual skills (sharpening) work off-grid
3. **Simplified logistics** - Less stuff = easier to manage in any scenario
4. **Automation redundancy** - HA integration allows monitoring/control
5. **Mental clarity** - Decluttered space = clearer thinking

### Cross-References

- **Minimalism creators**: `creators/profiles/christina-mychas.md`, `creators/profiles/gabe-bult.md`
- **Tool skills**: `skills/tools/whetstone-knife-sharpening.md`
- **Anti-consumerism philosophy**: `creators/profiles/ben-vallack.md`
- **Quality purchasing**: Applies "buy nice or buy twice" principle

## Quick Reference

**Philosophy:** Less stuff, always quality. The process of doing simple things makes a better life.

**Key Frameworks:**
- Christina Mychas: 10 Minimalist Rules
- Gabe Bult: 9 Minimalist Habits
- Ben Vallack: Unix philosophy (quality, single-purpose tools)

**Current Focus:**
1. Decluttering (boys' rooms, kitchen first)
2. Automation research (robot vacuum with HA)
3. Skill development (whetstone sharpening - March 2026)

**Decision Framework for Purchases:**
1. Is it a "hell yes"? → If no, stop
2. Can I pay in full today? → If no, save first
3. Does it create more problems? → If yes, stop
4. Will it last? → Buy nice or buy twice
5. Does it integrate with HA? (if automation) → Required
