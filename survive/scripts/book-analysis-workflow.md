# Book Analysis Workflow

## Reading Strategy

### Pre-Reading Assessment
- [ ] Check table of contents - what topics are covered?
- [ ] Read author bio - what's their background/credibility?
- [ ] Skim introduction/conclusion - what's the main thesis?
- [ ] Review index - what specific skills are taught?
- [ ] Set reading goals - what do you want to learn?

### Active Reading Techniques
1. **First Pass (Skim)**
   - Read chapter titles and headings
   - Look at diagrams, charts, photos
   - Identify high-value sections
   - Note page numbers for techniques of interest

2. **Second Pass (Active Reading)**
   - Read with notebook/markdown file open
   - Extract specific techniques
   - Note questions and uncertainties
   - Flag pages for photo/diagram reference
   - Cross-reference with existing knowledge

3. **Third Pass (Integration)**
   - Review notes and consolidate
   - Create skill files from techniques
   - Add to cross-reference database
   - Identify field testing opportunities

## Note-Taking System

### Page Reference Format
```
p.47 - Fire Starting: Bow Drill
- Technique uses friction to create ember
- Requires: spindle, fireboard, bow, cordage, bearing block
- Key: downward pressure + speed
- Common mistake: wrong wood selection
- Military note: Similar to survival school method but emphasizes efficiency over speed
```

### Technique Extraction Template

```

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Initial Documentation
```bash
# Create book file from template
cp books/TEMPLATE.md "books/in-progress/[book-title].md"

# Add to reading log
# Edit resources/reading-log.md
```

### Step 2: Reading Sessions
**During each session:**
- [ ] Note page range covered
- [ ] Extract 3-5 key techniques
- [ ] List any questions/confusions
- [ ] Identify cross-reference opportunities
- [ ] Update progress in reading log

### Step 3: Skill Extraction
**After completing each chapter:**
- [ ] Review notes for actionable skills
- [ ] Create/update skill files
- [ ] Add techniques to skills/INDEX.md
- [ ] Link back to book source

### Step 4: Completion Review
**When finishing book:**
- [ ] Write overall summary
- [ ] Rate book (usefulness, readability, accuracy)
- [ ] List top 5 takeaways
- [ ] Identify must-practice skills
- [ ] Move file to books/completed/
- [ ] Update reading log

### Step 5: Integration
**Within 1 week of completion:**
- [ ] Cross-reference with other sources
- [ ] Create analysis document if warranted
- [ ] Schedule field tests for key techniques
- [ ] Add to recommended reading if valuable

## Comparative Reading

### When reading multiple books on same topic:

**Create comparison matrix:**
```markdown
# Analysis: [Topic] Across Multiple Sources

## Sources
- Book A: [Title] by [Author]
- Book B: [Title] by [Author]
- Field Manual: [Reference]

## Technique Comparison

### [Specific Technique]
| Source | Approach | Steps | Equipment | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------|-------|-----------|------|------|
| Book A |          |       |           |      |      |
| Book B |          |       |           |      |      |
| FM     |          |       |           |      |      |

## Priority Tagging System

Use tags in your notes:

- `#PRIORITY-HIGH` - Essential survival skill, practice ASAP
- `#PRIORITY-MED` - Useful skill, schedule for practice
- `#PRIORITY-LOW` - Good to know, archive for later
- `#FIELD-TEST` - Needs practical validation
- `#QUESTION` - Unclear or needs more research
- `#MILITARY-DIFF` - Differs from military training
- `#GEAR-NEEDED` - Requires equipment acquisition
- `#CROSS-REF` - Check against other sources

## Red Flag Indicators

**Be skeptical when you see:**
- Overly complex techniques for basic tasks
- "Secret" or "lost" knowledge claims
- Dismissal of established methods without evidence
- Dangerous practices without adequate warnings
- Unrealistic timelines (e.g., "master in 1 day")
- Heavy product/gear recommendations
- Survival myths (sucking venom, moss=north, etc.)

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] Does this align with military training?
- [ ] Can I find corroboration in other sources?
- [ ] Does the physics/biology make sense?
- [ ] Has the author actually done this?
- [ ] Are there documented cases of success?

## Quarterly Reading Goals

### Balanced Reading Plan
- 1 Wilderness survival book
- 1 Homesteading/self-sufficiency book
- 1 Tactical/security book
- 1 Medical/first aid reference
- 1 Historical/mindset book

### Tracking Metrics
- Books completed: [X]/quarter goal
- Techniques extracted: [X]
- Skills practiced: [X]
- Field tests conducted: [X]
- Analysis documents created: [X]

## Integration with Podcast Content

**When book and podcast cover same topic:**
1. Create unified analysis document
2. Compare approaches from each medium
3. Note which medium explained better
4. Synthesize best practices from both
5. Document in cross-reference section

**Cross-reference format:**
```
Book: [Title] - p.X
Podcast: [Show] - Episode Y @ timestamp

Topic: [Name]

Book approach:
[Summary]

Podcast approach:
[Summary]

Synthesis:
[Combined best practice]

Field test results:
[What actually worked]
```
