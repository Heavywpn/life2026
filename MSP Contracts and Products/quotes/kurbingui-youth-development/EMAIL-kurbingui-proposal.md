**Subject:** Technology Partnership Proposal for Kurbingui - Venturer Technology

---

Hi,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us about Kurbingui's technology needs. It was great to learn more about the work you're doing across Zillmere, Caboolture, and Inala - supporting young people and families in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community is meaningful work, and we'd be honoured to support it.

I've put together a proposal based on our conversation. I've attached:

- **Technology Partnership Proposal** - outlines what we'd provide and the investment involved
- **Service Schedule** - the detailed breakdown of services, response times, and what's included
- **Master Service Agreement** - our standard terms (happy to walk through anything that needs clarification)

**What's in the proposal:**

Based on your size, the three sites, and the compliance requirements that come with government funding, we've put together a Premium partnership that includes a dedicated Technical Account Manager, 24/7 critical support, and the security and compliance framework you need. The proposal breaks down exactly what's included and what it costs.

I know one of your main concerns was getting clarity on where you actually stand - the onboarding process addresses that directly. We do a full environment assessment and Essential 8 audit across all three sites before we start making changes. You'll have a clear picture of your current state and a roadmap for where to go next.

**Why I think this could work well for both of us:**

Kurbingui is exactly the kind of organisation we want to work with. You're mission-driven, you're growing, and you need a partner who actually invests in the relationship - not one who disappears after the contract is signed. We've built our business around community-minded clients, and your values around accountability and teamwork line up with how we try to operate.

From our side, working with an established organisation across multiple sites gives us the opportunity to really demonstrate what a proper technology partnership looks like. We'd want Kurbingui to be a client we can point to and say "that's how it's supposed to work."

**Next steps:**

Happy to jump on a call to talk through any questions, or if it's easier, I can come out to Zillmere to go through the proposal in person. The documents are valid for 30 days, so no rush - take the time you need to review everything and loop in whoever else needs to be involved.

Let me know what works for you.

Cheers,
