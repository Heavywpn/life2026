## PROPOSAL FOR: Kurbingui Youth Development Limited

**Prepared by:** Venturer Technology
**Date:** [INSERT DATE]
**Valid until:** [INSERT DATE + 30 DAYS]
**Proposal reference:** VT-2024-KURBINGUI

---

## About This Proposal

This proposal outlines how Venturer Technology will partner with Kurbingui Youth Development to provide comprehensive technology leadership, support, and protection. Based on our understanding of your organisation, we've designed a solution that addresses your specific needs as a multi-site Aboriginal community organisation serving youth and families across South East Queensland.

---

## Executive Summary

### Your Situation

Kurbingui Youth Development Limited is a respected Aboriginal community organisation providing vital services to youth and families across Greater Brisbane and South East Queensland. With 70 staff across three locations (Zillmere, Caboolture, and Inala), and plans to grow to 90+ staff, you've reached a point where your current IT arrangements are no longer meeting your needs.

**Why you're looking for a new partner:**

You've told us that service from your current provider has fallen away. Response times have slipped, proactive guidance has disappeared, and you're left uncertain about the true state of your IT environment. For an organisation handling sensitive data about children, families, and community members, this uncertainty is unacceptable.

**What matters most to you:**

1. **Compliance and cyber security** - As a government-funded organisation, you need confidence that your systems meet funder requirements and protect the sacred data your community entrusts to you
2. **Understanding your current state** - You need clarity on where you stand today before you can plan for tomorrow
3. **A true technology partnership** - Not just a vendor who fixes things when they break, but a partner who builds a relationship with Kurbingui and understands your mission

### Our Recommendation

**Premium Technology Partnership**

Based on your organisation size (70+ staff), multi-site operations, government funding compliance requirements, and the sensitive nature of the data you handle, we recommend our Premium tier partnership. This provides the dedicated account management, 24/7 critical support, and comprehensive security monitoring that an organisation of your significance requires.

### What Matters Most

Based on our conversations with you:

1. **Compliance and cyber security** - Government funders increasingly require evidence of security practices; you need confidence your systems are protected and audit-ready
2. **Understanding where you stand** - Your current provider has left you uncertain about the state of your IT; you need a clear baseline assessment before moving forward
3. **A genuine technology partnership** - You've experienced what happens when service falls away; you want a partner who invests in the relationship, not just responds to tickets
4. **Protecting your community's data** - The information you hold about children, families, and community is sacred; a breach would harm the very people you serve

### Values Alignment

At Venturer Technology, we believe in partnerships built on shared values:

| Our Value | How It Benefits Kurbingui |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Fiercely Protect Our Clients** | We treat your community's data with the same care you do - as sacred trust |

## Why Venturer Technology?

### How We Address Your Concerns

**1. We Won't Let Service Fall Away**
You've experienced what happens when a provider stops investing in the relationship. Our Premium partnership includes a dedicated Technical Account Manager (TAM) - a named person who knows Kurbingui, visits your sites quarterly, and is accountable for your experience. Fortnightly strategic meetings and monthly business reviews mean we're always engaged, not just waiting for something to break.

**2. We'll Show You Where You Stand**
Your onboarding begins with a comprehensive environment assessment across all three sites. We document everything, assess your security posture, identify compliance gaps, and give you a clear picture of your current state. No more uncertainty - you'll know exactly where you are and what needs attention.

**3. Compliance and Security Are Built In**
Essential 8 compliance mapping, quarterly vulnerability scanning, 24/7 security monitoring - these aren't add-ons, they're included. We provide the evidence and reporting your funders require, so you can demonstrate your security posture with confidence.

**4. We Understand Mission-Driven Work**
We don't just serve community organisations - we operate like one. Through our community hiring mission, we create employment pathways for veterans, people with disabilities, and survivors. When you partner with us, you're working with people who understand what it means to serve community and protect sacred trust.

**5. A True Partnership, Not Just a Vendor**
We become your technology leadership team. Budget planning, strategic roadmaps, board presentations, vendor management - we're invested in Kurbingui's success, not just your monthly payment. When you grow to 90+ staff, we scale with you seamlessly.
