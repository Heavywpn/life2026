# Technology Partnership Proposal

## PROPOSAL FOR: Brisbane Community Housing Ltd

**Prepared by:** Venturer Technology
**Date:** 29 November 2024
**Valid until:** 29 December 2024
**Proposal reference:** VT-2024-047

---

## About This Proposal

This proposal outlines how Venturer Technology will partner with Brisbane Community Housing Ltd to provide comprehensive technology leadership, support, and protection. Based on our discovery conversations, we've designed a solution that addresses your specific needs and positions your organisation for success.

---

## Executive Summary

### Your Situation

Brisbane Community Housing is a registered NDIS provider with 12 staff delivering vital housing support services to people with disabilities in the Brisbane region. Currently, IT support is provided on a break/fix basis, which has led to slow response times when issues arise, uncertainty about your security posture, and concerns about meeting NDIS Practice Standards for information management. You're seeking a technology partner who understands your mission, can provide reliable support, and helps you meet your compliance obligations.

### Our Recommendation

**Professional Technology Partnership**

Based on your NDIS registration, government funding requirements, and the sensitive participant data you handle, we recommend our Professional tier partnership. This provides the 24/7 security monitoring, compliance documentation, and strategic guidance that registered NDIS providers require.

### Your Investment

| Component | Investment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Monthly Partnership** | **$1,740 + GST** |
| One-Time Onboarding | $4,000 + GST |

*12 users at $145/user per month (includes NDIS compliance support)*

---

## Understanding Your Organisation

### What We Heard

During our discovery conversation, we learned:

**About your organisation:**
- You provide housing support services to NDIS participants across Brisbane
- You're a registered NDIS provider subject to Practice Standards audits
- You receive government funding and need to demonstrate appropriate controls

**Your current technology:**
- Break/fix IT support with no ongoing relationship
- Microsoft 365 for email and basic file sharing
- Mix of laptops for case workers and desktops in the office
- No formal security monitoring or compliance documentation

**What's important to you:**
- Reliable support when things go wrong
- Meeting NDIS Practice Standards requirements
- Protecting participant data
- Predictable IT costs for budgeting

**What's not working:**
- Slow response from current break/fix provider
- No visibility into security posture
- Uncertainty about compliance status
- Staff onboarding/offboarding is manual and slow

### Values Alignment

| Our Value | How It Benefits Brisbane Community Housing |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Fiercely Protect Our Clients** | We protect your participant data like it's our own family's information |
