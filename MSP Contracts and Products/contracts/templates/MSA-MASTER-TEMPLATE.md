## AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and legal sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

---

## 1. SERVICES

### 1.1 Provision of Services

Provider will provide, as an independent contractor, its services (the "Services") and any related products, goods and/or equipment (the "Products") to Client to complete the projects or tasks described and attached to this Agreement in:

(a) the statement of work attached as Schedule 1;
(b) any subsequent statements of work approved in writing by both Parties; and
(c) any Change Orders, as defined below

(collectively, the "SOWs" and, each a "SOW"). The Services provided pursuant to each SOW will be subject to this Agreement and each applicable SOW.

### 1.2 Change Orders

Any material modifications to a SOW shall be made by written change order, executed by both Parties (a "Change Order").

### 1.3 Service Standards

Provider will perform the Services with due care and skill, in accordance with generally accepted industry standards and practices for managed IT service providers in Australia.

---

## 2. TERM

### 2.1 Initial Term

This Agreement shall continue for an initial term of **[12/24/36]** months commencing on the Effective Date (the "Initial Term").

### 2.2 Renewal

At the end of the Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically renew for successive periods of twelve (12) months each (each a "Renewal Term") unless either Party provides the other Party with written notice of its intent not to renew at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term. The Initial Term and any Renewal Terms are collectively referred to as the "Term".

### 2.3 Termination by Provider

Provider may terminate this Agreement:

(a) upon sixty (60) days' written notice to Client; or

(b) immediately upon written notice if Client fails to pay the Fees (as defined below) within thirty (30) days of receiving any invoice and such failure continues for a further fourteen (14) days after written notice of non-payment.

### 2.4 Termination by Client

Client may terminate this Agreement:

(a) upon sixty (60) days' written notice to Provider, subject to payment of the Early Termination Fee (if applicable); or

(b) immediately without penalty if Provider Cause (as defined below) occurs.

### 2.5 Early Termination Fee

If Client terminates this Agreement during the Initial Term without Provider Cause, Client shall pay Provider an early termination fee (the "Early Termination Fee") equal to fifty percent (50%) of the monthly recurring charges multiplied by the remaining months in the Initial Term. The Parties agree that this Early Termination Fee represents a genuine pre-estimate of the loss that Provider will suffer and is not a penalty. No Early Termination Fee applies to termination during any Renewal Term.

### 2.6 Provider Cause

For purposes of this Agreement, "Provider Cause" means Provider's material breach of this Agreement which remains unremedied for more than thirty (30) days after written notice specifying the breach is given by Client to Provider.

### 2.7 Transition Assistance

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Provider will provide reasonable transition assistance to Client for a period of up to thirty (30) days to facilitate the orderly transfer of Services to Client or a replacement provider. Such transition assistance will be provided at Provider's then-current hourly rates.

---

## 3. FEES AND PAYMENT

### 3.1 Fees

Client agrees to pay Provider for the Services and the Products according to the base fee (the "Base Fee") and other pricing terms, fee schedule, rates, fees, and incidental charges set forth in the SOWs (collectively, the "Fees"). All Fees are stated in Australian Dollars (AUD) and are exclusive of GST unless otherwise specified.

### 3.2 GST

If GST is payable on any supply made under this Agreement, the recipient of the supply must pay to the supplier an additional amount equal to the GST payable on the supply. Payment of the additional amount will be made at the same time as payment for the supply is required to be made. The supplier must provide a valid tax invoice to the recipient before the recipient is required to pay the additional amount.

### 3.3 Billing and Invoice

The Base Fee will be invoiced monthly in advance on the first business day of each month. Provider may invoice by direct debit, electronic funds transfer (EFT), or other agreed payment method. Client will pay Provider within fourteen (14) days of the invoice date (or by direct debit on the date specified in the invoice).

### 3.4 Late Payment

If payment for any Fees is not received by Provider by the due date, interest shall accrue on the outstanding amount at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the date due until paid in full. This interest rate is the maximum permitted under applicable Queensland law.

### 3.5 Disputed Invoices

If Client disputes any invoice in good faith, Client must notify Provider in writing within fourteen (14) days of the invoice date, specifying the nature of the dispute. The Parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. Client must pay any undisputed portion of the invoice by the due date.

---

## 4. PRICE ADJUSTMENTS

### 4.1 Annual CPI Adjustment

On each anniversary of the Effective Date during the Term, the Base Fee may be increased by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (All Groups) for Brisbane, as published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, for the preceding twelve (12) month period, capped at a maximum increase of five percent (5%) per annum.

### 4.2 User/Device Changes

Client agrees to promptly inform Provider whenever there are changes to the number of users, devices, or systems covered by the Services. Provider may adjust the monthly Fees to accurately reflect all current users and devices in accordance with the per-user or per-device pricing set out in the applicable SOW.

### 4.3 Price Increase Notice

Provider will provide Client with at least thirty (30) days' written notice of any Fee increase (other than increases due to user/device changes). Client may terminate this Agreement without penalty within fourteen (14) days of receiving notice of a Fee increase that exceeds the CPI cap.
