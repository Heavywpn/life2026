## Understanding NFP Technology Challenges

### Common Pain Points

| Challenge | Impact | How We Address It |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Limited IT budget | Stretched resources, deferred security | Predictable monthly pricing, no surprise bills |
| Staff wearing multiple hats | No dedicated IT expertise | We become your IT department |
| Volunteer/rotating workforce | Training gaps, security risks | Streamlined onboarding, security awareness |
| Donor data protection | Regulatory and reputational risk | Comprehensive security stack, compliance support |
| Board reporting requirements | Lack of technology visibility | Quarterly business reviews, executive reporting |
| Government funding compliance | Audit requirements, data handling | Essential 8 compliance, documentation |
| Legacy systems | Integration challenges, security gaps | Gradual modernisation, strategic roadmap |
| Growth uncertainty | Scaling technology up/down | Flexible per-user pricing |

### NFP-Specific Regulatory Considerations

**ACNC (Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission):**
- Governance standards require appropriate data protection
- Annual reporting obligations may include IT security posture
- DGR status brings additional scrutiny on data handling

**Government Funding Requirements:**
- Many grants now require Essential 8 compliance
- Data sovereignty requirements (Australian-hosted)
- Audit trails for funded activities

**Privacy Act 1988:**
- Applies to organisations with >$3M annual turnover, OR
- Applies to any organisation providing health services
- Many NFPs handling sensitive data voluntarily comply

**NDIS Providers:**
- NDIS Practice Standards require data protection
- Quality and Safeguarding Framework compliance
- Participant privacy and consent requirements

## Recommended Tier: Usually Professional

Most NFPs should be on **Professional tier** ($130/user) because:

| NFP Reality | Why Professional Fits |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Handle donor/beneficiary data | 24/7 SOC monitoring protects sensitive information |
| May receive government funding | Essential 8 compliance mapping included |
| Often NDIS providers | Security stack meets Practice Standards |
| Volunteers access systems | MDM and security awareness training essential |
| Board needs visibility | Quarterly business reviews with executive reporting |
| Staff turnover higher | Streamlined MACs process (5/month included) |
| Budget predictability critical | Fixed monthly fee, no surprise charges |

### When Essential Tier Works

**Essential ($85/user)** is appropriate for very small charities when ALL of the following apply:
- 1-3 staff only (truly micro organisation)
- No sensitive beneficiary data (advocacy, awareness-only charities)
- No government funding or grants
- No compliance requirements
- Simple technology stack (email, basic cloud apps)
- Business hours support is sufficient

### When Premium Tier Is Needed

**Premium ($175-220/user)** for larger NFPs with:
- 50+ staff
- Multiple locations or national presence
- Significant compliance burden (government contracts, high-risk services)
- Board/committee requiring executive technology reporting
- 24/7 critical support needs (crisis services, accommodation providers)
- Dedicated account manager relationship required
