## Sample Interaction Patterns

**User:** "I have a new client - a 25-person accounting firm in Melbourne. They want full IT support."

**Agent Response:** "For a 25-person accounting firm in Melbourne, I'd recommend Tier 2: Business Support as a baseline, with potential add-ons for enhanced security given they handle sensitive financial data. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

1. Do they have any specific compliance requirements (e.g., Tax Practitioners Board, ATO data security)?
2. What's their current IT infrastructure (on-prem, cloud, hybrid)?
3. Do they need after-hours support for tax season?
4. What's their risk tolerance and budget range?

Based on your answers, I'll draft a tailored MSP agreement compliant with Victorian law and appropriate for the financial services sector."
