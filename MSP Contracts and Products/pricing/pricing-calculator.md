[[]]# Venturer Technology Pricing Calculator

## Pricing Philosophy

Based on TruMethods Picanomics principles, our pricing focuses on two key levers:

1. **Average All-In Seat Price (AISP)** - Average monthly fee per user
2. **Average Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** - Average monthly contract value

When both levers work together in the right direction, margins improve significantly.

## Target Metrics

### Target Average MRR by Client Size

| Client Size | Target Avg MRR | Minimum MRR | Typical Tier |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Micro (1-3 users) | $255-300 | $85 | Essential |
| Small (4-10 users) | $520-1,300 | $520 | Professional |
| Growing (11-25 users) | $1,430-3,250 | $1,430 | Professional |
| Medium (26-50 users) | $3,380-6,500 | $3,380 | Professional |
| Large (50-100 users) | $8,750-22,000 | $8,750 | Premium |
| Enterprise (100+ users) | $17,500+ | $17,500 | Premium |

**Critical Threshold:** Below $1,500/month average MRR, margins decrease due to fixed vCIO and alignment costs. Target Professional tier clients with 12+ users.

## Pricing Calculator

### Step 1: Count Users

| User Type | Count | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Full-time staff | [___] | All staff requiring IT support |
| Part-time staff | [___] | Count as full user if using IT regularly |
| Contractors | [___] | Regular contractors needing access |
| **Total Users** | [___] | |

### Step 2: Determine Tier

**Tier Selection Decision Tree:**

```
Is the organisation 50+ users AND needs dedicated TAM/24/7 critical?
  └─ YES → PREMIUM ($175-220/user)
  └─ NO ↓

Does the organisation have ANY of these?
  • 4+ staff
  • Financial services, legal, healthcare, NDIS
  • Government funding
  • Compliance requirements (Essential 8, industry regs)
  • Need for 24/7 security monitoring
  • Multiple locations
  └─ YES → PROFESSIONAL ($130/user)
  └─ NO ↓

Simple business, 1-3 staff, no compliance needs?
  └─ YES → ESSENTIAL ($85/user)
```

**Selected Tier:** [_______________]
**Base Price per User:** $[___]

### Step 3: Adjust for Complexity (Optional)

## Picanomics Reference

### Understanding the Metrics

```
Average AISP = Total MRR ÷ Total Seats Supported
Average MRR = Total MRR ÷ Number of MSA Clients
```

### Example Portfolio Analysis

| Scenario | Clients | Total Seats | Total MRR | Avg AISP | Avg MRR |
|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Target State** | 40 | 800 | $104,000 | $130 | $2,600 |
| Low AISP Problem | 40 | 800 | $72,000 | $90 | $1,800 |
| Small Client Problem | 40 | 400 | $52,000 | $130 | $1,300 |
| Both Problems | 40 | 400 | $36,000 | $90 | $900 |

**Impact:** Portfolio with both problems earns 65% less than target state.

### Venturer Transformation Targets

| Metric | Legacy State | Year 1 Target | Year 3 Target |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Average AISP | $45 | $100 | $130 |
| Minimum new client AISP | N/A | $85 (Essential) | $130 (Professional) |
| Average MRR | ~$800 | $1,800 | $2,600 |
| Minimum new client MRR | None | $520 | $1,000 |
| Target tier mix | All legacy | 30% E / 60% P / 10% Pr | 20% E / 60% P / 20% Pr |

## Proposal Pricing Format

When presenting to clients, focus on **outcomes not ingredients**:

### Recommended Format

> **Your Monthly Investment: $2,340 + GST**
>
> Complete technology partnership for your 18 team members, including:
> - 24/7 security monitoring and threat response
> - Help desk support during extended business hours
> - Monthly strategic technology guidance
> - Quarterly business reviews with your leadership team
> - Essential 8 compliance mapping and improvement
> - All the technology leadership you need to focus on your mission

### Avoid This

Don't present as a menu of line items:
- RMM per device: $X
- Patching per server: $X
- AV per endpoint: $X
- SOC monitoring: $X

This invites comparison shopping and commoditizes your service.

---

## Price Increase Process

### Annual Increases (Existing Clients)

1. Review CPI (Brisbane All Groups) - typically 2-4%
2. Review vendor cost changes
3. Determine increase (typically CPI or 5%, contractual terms apply)
4. Send 30-day written notice
5. Apply from next billing cycle after notice period

### Legacy Client Transformation

For existing $45/seat legacy clients:

| Year | Target AISP | Approach |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Year 1 | $60-75/seat | Value conversation + modest increase |
| Year 2 | $85-100/seat | Transition to Essential tier |
| Year 3 | $100-130/seat | Upgrade to Professional or exit |

**Approach:**
1. Lead with value delivered and service improvements
2. Explain security enhancements (SOC, compliance)
3. Offer tier selection (some may choose Essential)
4. Be prepared to transition clients who can't/won't pay fair value

## Onboarding Fees (Quoted Separately)

| Tier | Typical Onboarding Range | Includes |
|------|--------------------------|----------|
| Essential | $500-1,500 | Basic assessment, tool deployment, documentation |
| Professional | $2,500-7,500 | Full assessment, security baseline, compliance gap analysis |
| Premium | $15,000-35,000 | Deep-dive discovery, TAM assignment, executive alignment, 10-12 week transition |

*Always quote onboarding separately—never roll into monthly fee.*
