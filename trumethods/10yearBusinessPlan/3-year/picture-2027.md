## Why This Matters

**To reach the 10-year vision (16 staff, $5-10M, foundation model, freedom), we need to be HERE by 2027.**

This is halfway to the vision - proving the model scales before the final push.

## Business Picture 2027

### Staff & Scale

**Team Size:**
- **8-10 revenue-producing staff** (halfway to 16)
- All mission-aligned: veterans, disabilities, life-changers
- Team culture established and documented
- New hires thriving (proof model works)

**Revenue:**
- **$2-3 million turnover annually**
- On track to double in next 3 years (to $5-10M by 2034)

**Recurring Revenue:**
- **60-70% from MRR/ARR** (up from current %)
- Transition away from project-based work mostly complete
- Client retention high (service-first model proven)

### Geographic Expansion

**Office Locations:**
- **Brisbane (HQ):** Solid, established, running smoothly
- **North Queensland:** Opened and operational
  - Staff hired locally or relocated
  - Serving regional clients
  - Community presence established
- **Third location:** Planned and scouted
  - Staff member identified with community connection
  - Rollout timeline set for 2028-2029

### Foundation Model

**Status by 2027:**
- **Designed:** Legal structure determined (not-for-profit framework)
- **Piloting:** Small-scale test of training + placement model
  - 2-3 trainees through program
  - Outcomes documented
  - Proof of concept validated

**Not Yet:**
- Full foundation launch (that's 2028-2030)
- But structure proven and ready to scale

### Leadership Transition (Critical)

**Manager:**
- **Identified and training** (not running everything yet, but growing into role)
- Taking on increasing responsibilities
- Learning Ricky's decision-making frameworks
- Building relationships with key clients and staff

**Ricky's Role:**
- Still heavily involved but **30-40% less** day-to-day than now
- Strategic focus increasing
- Documenting processes for transition
- Mentoring manager

**Kristyn:**
- **Planning her exit** to own projects
- Transitioning responsibilities
- Exploring what she wants to build/pursue
- Still involved but path to freedom visible

## Quarterly Rocks Leading to 2027

**To get there, we need ~12 quarters of focused execution.**

Each quarter (90 days) needs 3-7 "Rocks" - critical priorities that move us toward this picture.

**Example Q1 2025 Rocks:**
- Hire 1 mission-aligned staff member
- Increase MRR by $X
- Scout North QLD office locations
- Identify manager candidate
- Maintain ice bath routine 90%+ days
- Complete Telos foundation files

**These will be detailed in `/quarterly-rocks/` folder.**

## Risks & Challenges to Monitor

**Business Risks:**
- Hiring quality mission-aligned staff (can't compromise on values)
- Scaling while maintaining integrity (greed temptations)
- Manager transition (finding right person, training them)
- Market changes (MSP industry evolving)

**Personal Risks:**
- Health deterioration (pain, tinnitus worsening)
- Drinking relapse (vigilance required)
- Family needs (Parker, Ronin, Kristyn situations)
- Burnout (trying to do too much)

**Mitigation:**
- Weekly reviews catch early warning signs
- Support systems (Kristyn, Rotary, veteran welfare community)
- Documented processes reduce dependency on Ricky
- Health tracking (ice baths, journaling, KPIs)

## Connection to 10-Year Vision

**2027 is the validation point:**

If we hit this 3-year picture, we've proven:
- Model scales (doubled staff, revenue)
- Manager transition possible (reducing Ricky's load)
- Foundation model viable (pilot successful)
- Personal sustainability (healthy coping, travel starting)

**If we're NOT at this picture by 2027:**
- 10-year vision needs adjustment
- Strategy needs rethinking
- Resources or approach reconsidered

**3-year checkpoints are critical course-corrections.**

## What Has to Be True

**For this 2027 picture to be real:**

1. **Current business stays healthy** while growing
2. **Right people found** (8-10 mission-aligned staff is specific, hard)
3. **Ricky starts letting go** (manager transition begins)
4. **Kristyn starts exploring** (her own future beyond operations)
5. **Healthy habits maintained** (ice baths, controlled drinking, Telos practice)
6. **Revenue grows ~30% YoY** (aggressive but achievable)
7. **MRR model adopted by clients** (shift from projects to ongoing service)
