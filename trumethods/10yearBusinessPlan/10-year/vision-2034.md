## Business Vision: Venturer Technology + Foundation

### Scale & Structure

**Staff:**
- **16+ revenue-producing staff** (all mission-aligned: veterans, disabilities, life-changers)
- Multiple teams across 3 locations

**Revenue:**
- **$5-10 million turnover annually**
- **Majority from MRR/ARR** (Monthly/Annual Recurring Revenue)
  - Predictable, sustainable revenue model
  - Away from project-based/one-time sales
  - Client retention focus

**Geographic Footprint:**
- **Brisbane** (HQ) - Core operations
- **North Queensland** - Regional presence
- **Third location** - Staff member-driven (someone with community connection expands there)

### Mission Evolution: Foundation Model

**Why This Matters:**
- Current: Hiring mission-aligned people directly in business
- 2034: **Separate not-for-profit foundation**
  - Provides training and opportunity
  - Proves the model at scale
  - Replicable by other companies
  - Separates mission work from commercial operations (sustainability)

**Impact:**
- Other companies can adopt this model
- Veterans, people with disabilities, life-changers get structured pathway to employment
- Venturer proves it works commercially while foundation scales the social impact

### Leadership & Operations

**Management Structure:**
- **Manager running day-to-day operations**
  - Most of Ricky's current responsibilities transitioned
  - Allows Ricky to focus on strategic, legacy work

**Ricky's Role:**
- Strategic vision and leadership
- Legacy documentation (proving the model works)
- Industry influence (speaking, teaching, replicating model)
- Travel and experiences (not tied to daily operations)

**Kristyn's Role:**
- **Exited operational business** (by choice)
- Running her own projects/passions
- Freedom to pursue what matters to her

### Legacy & Documentation

**The Proof:**
- **Mission hiring works** - documented results over 10 years
- **Service beats greed** - client retention, profitability, employee thriving
- **Disability isn't disqualifying** - careers built, lives transformed

**Documentation:**
- Numbers: retention rates, employee outcomes, business growth
- Stories: individual transformations (like Peter's success)
- Model: replicable framework for other companies
- Industry impact: what changed because of what we proved

## Personal Vision: Family, Travel, Legacy

### Family

**Grandchildren (If They Exist):**
- **Strong relationship** - being to them what grandfather was to Ricky
- Teaching practical skills, encouraging adventure
- "Don't be held back" passed to next generation

**Parker (Son - will be ~32):**
- Following and supporting his career path
- Relationship with Liam (partner)
- Their foster/family situation
- Regular connection despite Melbourne distance

**Ronin (Son - will be ~30):**
- Supporting his career (AI/Robotics field)
- His adventures and goals
- Regular time together

**Kristyn (Wife):**
- **Lots of travel and experiences together**
- Finally living the "don't be held back" lesson
- Freedom from business operations
- Her own projects and passions pursued

### Lifestyle

**Work:**
- Not tied to daily operations
- Strategic only
- Freedom to travel
- Time with family prioritized

**Health:**
- Managing ongoing pain (leg, ribs, arm) - will always be reality
- Tinnitus management strategies working
- Healthy coping mechanisms established (10 years of ice baths/alternatives)
- Staying active despite limitations

**Travel:**
- Regular trips with Kristyn
- Experiencing cultures and people (not just cities)
- Boat rebuild completed? (If that dream pursued)
- Adventure and exploration priority

### Legacy Left Behind

**What's Been Proven:**
1. People with disabilities can build successful careers with opportunity
2. Veterans can transition successfully when given real support
3. Service-first business IS more profitable than greed-first
4. Integrity-based pricing works at scale
5. Mission-aligned hiring creates thriving employees, not charity cases

**For the Boys:**
- Watched parents build something meaningful through service
- Saw that showing up despite pain/difficulty is what matters
- Learned that breaking cycles (abuse → service) is possible
- Understanding that success = impact, not comfort

## Key Themes (Aligned with Telos Mission)

### Problem P1: People Left Behind by Systems
- **10-year impact:** Foundation model providing systematic opportunities
- **Proof:** 16+ lives transformed through employment
- **Scale:** Model replicated by others

### Problem P2: Integrity vs Greed in Business
- **10-year impact:** $5-10M business proving service-first sustainability
- **Proof:** Client retention, employee thriving, profitable integrity
- **Industry:** Other MSPs questioning their greed-based models

### Problem P3: Cyber Vulnerability
- **10-year impact:** Hundreds of businesses and charities protected
- **Proof:** MRR/ARR model = ongoing protection, not one-time fixes
- **Community:** Vulnerable organizations defended from predators

## Connection to Telos Mission

**2034 = Living Proof:**
- 10 years of daily proof compiled

- Family legacy established
