- No established competitors in Brisbane
- Industry standards don't exist yet
- Early mover advantage massive

**Strategic Value:**
- Positions Core Computers/Venturer Technology as AI security experts
- Differentiates from commodity IT services
- High-margin consulting (60-70%+ margins)
- Recurring revenue opportunity (quarterly assessments)
- Expands cybersecurity practice
- Aligns with P3 mission (protect vulnerable businesses)

## Problem This Solves (Telos Alignment)

### P3: People & Businesses Vulnerable to Cyber Threats

**Current Reality (2025):**
- 80%+ of enterprise AI chatbots leak system prompts (contains trade secrets, business logic)
- Companies unknowingly sending Salesforce data to OpenAI
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) has no security built in
- Sam Altman admits: "Can only get to 95% on prompt injection prevention"
- Over-logging exposing customer PII and confidential data
- Executives mandating "build AI" without security planning
- Engineers rushing implementations without threat modeling

**Brisbane Business Impact:**
- Local businesses implementing AI without understanding risks
- No local experts to guide them
- Big consultancies too expensive for SMBs
- MSPs don't have AI security expertise
- Charities implementing AI with zero security budget

**Core Computers Can Protect Them:**
We have the technical foundation (cybersecurity, network security, Microsoft expertise) and can rapidly build AI security capability through focused training and certification.

### P2: Service-First Business Model

**Differentiation:**
- Not selling fear, selling protection
- Education-first approach (workshops, demonstrations)
- Transparent pricing (fixed packages, no hidden fees)
- Build long-term relationships, not one-off sales
- Help clients implement AI SAFELY, not block innovation

**Proof of Service-First:**
Could charge $10,000+ for AI pentests (market would bear it)
Pricing at $500-$3,500 makes accessible to Brisbane SMBs
Focus on prevention, not remediation gouging

---

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Knowledge Gap (High Priority)

**Risk:**
Team doesn't have AI security expertise yet

**Mitigation:**
- Structured 90-day training plan (see separate document)
- Start with Bronze packages (lower complexity)
- Partner with Hidden Layer for complex cases (if needed)
- Build expertise iteratively (learn by doing)
- Document everything (create internal playbook)

**Timeline to Competency:**
- Week 4: Can deliver Bronze assessments
- Week 8: Can deliver Silver assessments
- Week 12: Can deliver Gold assessments

### Risk 2: Market Education Required

**Risk:**
Brisbane businesses don't know they need this yet

**Mitigation:**
- Education-first marketing (workshops, blog posts)
- Free assessments for first 5 clients (case studies)
- Local media coverage ("Brisbane IT company warns...")
- Demonstrate attacks (show, don't tell)
- Leverage existing client relationships (warm intros)

**Marketing Budget:**
Year 1: $3,000 (workshops, materials, media outreach)

### Risk 3: Rapid Technology Change

**Risk:**
AI security landscape evolving quickly (techniques obsolete fast)

**Mitigation:**
- Continuous learning commitment (4 hours/week reading)
- Follow researchers (@JohnnyXmas, Hidden Layer, etc.)
- Join AI security communities (Discord, forums)
- Update methodology quarterly
- Attend conferences (RSA, local security meetups)

**Ongoing Investment:**
$2,000/year in training and tools

### Risk 4: Pricing Too Low

**Risk:**
Undervaluing services (could charge more)

**Mitigation:**
- Start conservative, raise prices after proof
- Year 1: Build portfolio and testimonials
- Year 2: Raise prices 20-30% based on demand
- Gold package designed for growth (recurring)
- Add premium tiers as expertise grows

**Pricing Evolution:**
- Year 1: $500/$1,500/$3,500
- Year 2: $750/$2,000/$5,000
- Year 3: $1,000/$2,500/$7,500

### Risk 5: Time Allocation (Ricky's Capacity)

**Risk:**
Ricky already stretched thin (daily operations, BNI VP, Rotary, family)

**Mitigation:**
- Year 1: Ricky leads, invests 10 hours/week
- Leverage Dean for technical execution (train him first)
- Peter interested? (cerebral work, can learn remotely)
- Build SOPs so others can deliver (systematize early)
- Year 2: Hire dedicated AI security analyst

**Capacity Check:**
- 10 hours/week = 40 hours/month
- Bronze: 5 hours each = 8 assessments/month capacity
- Silver: 15 hours each = 2-3 assessments/month capacity
- Gold: 35 hours each = 1 assessment/month capacity
- Year 1 target: 50 total clients = ~4 clients/month average = ACHIEVABLE
