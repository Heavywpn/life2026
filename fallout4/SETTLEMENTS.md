## Settlement Build Priority

## Supply Line Network

Recommended hub-and-spoke layout:

```
                    Sanctuary (HUB)
                         |
    -------------------- + --------------------
    |         |          |          |         |
   Red     Starlight  Graygarden  Tenpines  Abernathy
  Rocket   Drive-In
    |
 Hangman's
  Alley
    |
  Castle ---- Warwick ---- Nordhagen
```

Connect all settlements to one hub (Sanctuary recommended). Resources will be shared across all connected settlements.

## Settlement Attack Defense Guide

### Defense Rating Needed
- Total defense should equal: Food + Water production
- Higher defense = fewer attacks

### Best Defenses
1. **Heavy Machinegun Turrets** - Best DPS
2. **Missile Turrets** - High damage
3. **Laser Turrets** - Energy damage

### Reduce Attack Chance
- High defense rating
- Low food/water stored (attackers want resources)
- Active defense = faster resolution
