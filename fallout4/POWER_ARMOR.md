## Power Armor Tips

### Conservation
1. Don't sprint constantly - drains cores fast
2. Exit armor near workbenches - enemies can steal it
3. Remove core when storing - NPCs will take your armor!
4. Fast travel doesn't drain cores

### Combat
1. Power armor reduces fall damage significantly
2. Jetpack + Explosive Vent = landing bomb
3. Companions can use power armor (give them a core)
4. Radiation damage nearly eliminated

### Collection
1. Store PA at settlements on power armor stations
2. Each frame can hold one full suit
3. You can mix and match pieces from different types
4. Legendary PA pieces exist from enemies/drops
