- [ ] Clear Concord and get Power Armor + Minigun
- [ ] Establish Sanctuary as your main base
- [ ] Start collecting adhesive ingredients (corn, mutfruit, tato, purified water)

## Recommended Early Perks

**Priority perks for power:**
1. **Scrounger** (LCK 2) - More ammo everywhere

## S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Book Location

There's a "You're SPECIAL!" book under Shaun's crib in your Sanctuary home that gives +1 to any stat. Don't miss it!

## Critical Tips

1. **Don't rush the main quest** - Side content becomes unavailable after certain points

3. **Collect everything** - Junk is valuable for crafting
4. **Companion affinity** - Keep companions happy for their unique perks
5. **Sleep in beds** - Well Rested bonus = 10% more XP
