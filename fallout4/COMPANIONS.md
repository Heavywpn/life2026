## Affinity Tips

### How Affinity Works
- Companions gain/lose affinity based on your actions while they're with you
- Affinity ranges from -1000 (hatred) to +1000 (max)
- You get perk at max affinity (+1000)
- Romance requires max affinity + correct dialogue choices

### Fastest Ways to Gain Affinity

| Companion | Fast Method |
|-----------|-------------|
| Piper | Pick locks (non-owned) while she watches |
| Nick Valentine | Hack terminals |
| Cait | Pick locks, then take chems (before her quest) |
| MacCready | Steal items, pick owned locks |
| Curie | Donate items, be generous in dialogue |
| Danse | Modify weapons at workbench (with him watching) |
| Preston | Help settlements, be generous |
| Hancock | Use chems, be generous |
| Deacon | Pick locks, hack terminals |

### Speech Options

When you reach certain affinity thresholds, companions initiate conversations:
- **250 affinity:** First conversation
- **500 affinity:** Second conversation
- **750 affinity:** Third conversation (relationship talk for romanceable)
- **1000 affinity:** Final talk + perk granted

For romance, choose "Flirt" options during relationship talks (requires Charisma checks).
