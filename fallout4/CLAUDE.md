# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **Fallout 4 playthrough tracker** - a collection of markdown files to help track game progress, collectibles, quests, and provide gameplay guidance. There is no code to build or test.

## File Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| README.md | Overview and quick start checklist |
| EARLY_GAME_POWER.md | Phased power progression guide |
| QUESTS.md | All quests by faction with completion warnings |
| BOBBLEHEADS.md | 20 bobblehead locations and effects |
| MAGAZINES.md | 100+ magazine locations by series |
| COMPANIONS.md | 13 companions with perks and affinity tips |
| UNIQUE_ITEMS.md | Unique weapons/armor with tier ratings |
| SETTLEMENTS.md | 30+ settlements with requirements |
| POWER_ARMOR.md | Power armor locations, mods, fusion cores |

## Conventions

- **Checkboxes:** Use `- [ ]` for incomplete, `- [x]` for complete
- **Tables:** Used for structured data (locations, stats, comparisons)
- **Tier ratings:** S/A/B/C for item quality rankings
- **Warnings:** Faction point-of-no-return quests are clearly marked in QUESTS.md

## Common Tasks

When the user asks gameplay questions, reference the appropriate file. When they report progress, help them update checkboxes in the relevant tracker file.
