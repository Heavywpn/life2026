## Tips

- Bobbleheads can increase S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats beyond 10
- Collect S.P.E.C.I.A.L. bobbleheads AFTER reaching 10 in that stat for max benefit
- All bobbleheads can be displayed on a special stand (build at settlements)
- The Perception bobblehead is easily missed if you leave Concord too quickly
