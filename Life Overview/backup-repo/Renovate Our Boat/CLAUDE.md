This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **boat renovation project** for a Bayliner 195 located in Queensland, Australia. The project is managed by Rick & Kristyn with dual goals: restore the boat to operational condition for weekly use and/or prepare it for sale.

**Critical Context:** All work must comply with Australian and Queensland maritime and road safety regulations.

## Repository Structure

This is a **documentation-only project** - no code or software. The structure is:

```

├── docs/           # Technical specs, manuals, service history
├── compliance/     # Australian/QLD regulatory requirements
├── tasks/          # Work planning and task tracking
├── journal/        # Personal reflections and memories
└── photos/         # Visual documentation
```

## Core Documents

### Compliance Documents
- **`compliance/COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md`** - Complete Australian and Queensland maritime safety requirements including safety equipment, navigation lights, registration, and environmental compliance
- **`tasks/TRAILER_COMPLIANCE.md`** - Queensland road safety requirements for boat trailers including registration, lights, brakes, tyres, and towing requirements

### Task Tracking
- **`tasks/BOAT_REPAIRS.md`** - 10-phase boat restoration checklist covering hull work, engine/mechanical, electrical, plumbing, interior, safety equipment, registration, testing, and ongoing maintenance

### Personal Documentation
- **`journal/PROJECT_JOURNAL.md`** - Personal reflections, emotions, memories, and the meaning of the project to Rick & Kristyn. Includes sections about freedom on the water and Kristyn's enjoyment of going topless while boating.

## Working with This Project

### Understanding the Dual Nature
This project balances two perspectives:
1. **Technical/Compliance:** Detailed checklists ensuring legal and safe boat operation
2. **Personal/Emotional:** The meaning, joy, and freedom the boat represents to the owners

When adding content:
- Technical sections should be factual, detailed, and compliance-focused
- Journal sections should be authentic, personal, and emotion-focused
- Maintain this balance - neither should overshadow the other

### Regulatory Context
**Always verify** that suggestions comply with:
- Queensland Maritime Safety regulations (Maritime Safety Queensland - MSQ)
- Australian maritime safety standards
- Queensland road rules for trailers (ATM/GTM requirements)
- Current registration and licensing requirements

When uncertain about compliance, note that regulations should be verified with official sources.

### Document Updates
- Checklists use `[ ]` for unchecked items and `[x]` for completed items
- Journal entries should maintain the personal, reflective tone
- Dates should use format: `___________` (underscores) for user to fill in
- Budget tracking uses: `$___________` format

### Key Regulatory Notes
- **Boat Safety Equipment:** USL 1D (Smooth/Partially Smooth Waters) requirements apply
- **Trailer Brakes:** Required when ATM (Aggregate Trailer Mass) > 750kg
- **Breakaway System:** Required when ATM > 2000kg
- **Marine Driver Licence:** Required for boat operation in Queensland

## Project Philosophy

This project is about **reclaiming freedom** through boat restoration. When working on this project:
- Respect the personal nature of the journal content
- Maintain the balance between practical tasks and emotional significance
- Understand that this boat represents more than transportation - it's about adventure, escape, and connection to nature
- The journal explicitly includes personal topics like Kristyn's love of going topless on the boat as an expression of freedom

## File Naming Conventions
- Use ALL_CAPS for major documents (e.g., `COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md`, `BOAT_REPAIRS.md`)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate content
- Maintain consistency with existing naming patterns
