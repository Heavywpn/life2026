## EOS Rock Criteria

A well-defined Rock must be:
- **Specific**: Clearly defined outcome, not a vague goal
- **Measurable**: Can definitively say "done" or "not done" at 90 days
- **Achievable**: Realistic to complete in 90 days with current resources
- **Impactful**: Moves the company meaningfully toward annual goals
- **Single Owner**: One person accountable (even for company-wide rocks)

## Rock Review Cadence

**Weekly (Level 10 Meetings):**
- Update status for each rock (on track / at risk)
- Add weekly progress entry
- Identify blockers and get help

**Monthly Deep Dive:**
- Review trajectory toward completion
- Adjust tactics if needed (don't change the rock itself)
- Reallocate resources if at risk

**Quarterly (Planning Sessions):**
- Final completion assessment (done vs. not done)
- Celebrate completions
- Analyze incomplete rocks (why?)
- Set next quarter's rocks

## Notes

**Company Rocks vs. Individual Rocks:**
- Company rocks benefit the entire business and typically require cross-functional effort
- Individual rocks are owned by one person and may support company rocks or departmental goals
- Typically 3-7 company rocks per quarter maximum
- Each person typically has 3-7 individual rocks per quarter

**Ownership:**
- Each company rock has ONE owner accountable for completion
- Owner doesn't do all the work but ensures it gets done
- Owner reports status in weekly Level 10 meetings

**Status Definitions:**
- **Not Started:** Rock defined but work hasn't begun
- **In Progress:** Active work happening, on track for 90-day completion
- **At Risk:** Behind schedule, blockers present, or unlikely to complete on time
- **Complete:** Success criteria fully met, rock done
