## How to Use This System

### Quarterly Planning (Start of Each Quarter)

**1. Review Previous Quarter**
- Archive completed rocks
- Analyze completion rate and learnings
- Identify what worked and what didn't

**2. Set New Rocks (Team Planning Session)**
- Start with annual goals - what must happen this quarter to stay on track?
- Identify 3-7 company rocks that benefit the entire business
- Assign ONE owner to each company rock
- Each person sets 3-7 individual rocks aligned with company priorities
- Ensure rocks meet all EOS criteria (specific, measurable, achievable, 90 days, one owner)

**3. Document in System**
- Add new rocks to appropriate files using the template
- Set start/due dates (typically quarter boundaries)
- Define clear success criteria
- Initial status: "Not Started"

### Weekly Updates (Level 10 Meetings)

**Every Week:**
1. Review each active rock
2. Update status (Not Started / In Progress / At Risk / Complete)
3. Add dated progress entry
4. Identify blockers and get help
5. Confirm next week's actions

**Time Investment:** 5-10 minutes per person to prepare, discuss in meeting

### Monthly Deep Dives

**Once Per Month:**
- Review trajectory for each rock
- Assess if on track for 90-day completion
- Reallocate resources if rocks are at risk
- Don't change the rock itself - adjust tactics

### End of Quarter Review

**Final Assessment:**
- Mark each rock Complete or Not Complete (binary, no partial credit)
- Calculate completion rate (target: 80%+ completion)
- Document why incomplete rocks missed
- Celebrate completions
- Move completed rocks to archive section

## What Makes a Good Rock?

### The 5 Criteria

1. **Specific**: "Launch new vCIO service tier with documented process" NOT "Improve vCIO services"
2. **Measurable**: Can definitively answer "Is this done?" at end of quarter
3. **Achievable**: Realistic given 90 days and current resources/capacity
4. **Impactful**: Meaningfully moves toward annual goals
5. **One Owner**: Single person accountable (even if others help)

### Good Rock Examples

- "Complete MSP pricing restructure: new pricing tiers documented, approved, and communicated to team by March 31"
- "Onboard 5 new managed services customers at $150/seat minimum pricing"
- "Document and implement customer business review process: template, schedule, completed QBRs with 10 customers"
- "Achieve $50K MRR by March 31 through new customer acquisition and service tier upgrades"

### Bad Rock Examples (Too Vague)

- "Improve sales" - Not specific or measurable
- "Work on customer relationships" - No clear outcome
- "Better processes" - Not measurable
- "Grow the business" - Too broad, not achievable in 90 days

---

## Rock Ownership

### Company Rocks
- Benefit the entire organization
- One owner accountable for completion
- Owner reports in weekly Level 10 meetings
- Often require cross-functional collaboration

### Individual Rocks
- Owned by one person
- May support company rocks or departmental goals
- Represent that person's top 90-day priorities
- Should be things only that person can do (or lead)

---

## Status Definitions

- **Not Started**: Rock defined but work hasn't begun yet
- **In Progress**: Active work happening, on track for completion
- **At Risk**: Behind schedule, blockers present, completion in jeopardy
- **Complete**: All success criteria met, rock is done

---

## Tips for Success

### For Rock Owners

1. **Review rocks daily** - Keep them top of mind
2. **Block time for rocks** - They're priorities, schedule them first
3. **Ask for help early** - Don't wait until end of quarter
4. **Update weekly** - Even if progress is small, document it
5. **Binary completion** - Done or not done, no partial credit

### For the Team

1. **Limit rocks** - 3-7 per person/company is ideal, more dilutes focus
2. **Connect rocks to vision** - Should ladder up to annual goals
3. **Make them visible** - Review in every Level 10 meeting
4. **Hold accountable** - Owners must report status weekly
5. **Celebrate wins** - Recognize rock completions publicly

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Setting too many rocks (spreading focus too thin)
- Vague rocks without clear success criteria
- Treating rocks like task lists (rocks are outcomes, not to-dos)
- Changing rocks mid-quarter (adjust tactics, not the rock)
- Accepting "mostly done" (rocks are binary: done or not)
- Forgetting about rocks between meetings
