## Quarterly Reflection Questions

Use these at the end of each quarter:

1. **Completion Rate:** What percentage of rocks did I complete?
2. **Quality:** Did completed rocks meet all success criteria or just "sort of done"?
3. **Capacity:** Did I take on too many or too few rocks?
4. **Focus:** Did I stay focused or get distracted by urgent non-rock work?
5. **Impact:** Did these rocks improve operations and support the team?
6. **Learning:** What will I do differently next quarter?
