# TruMethods Framework Implementation Roadmap for Venturer Technology

## DOCUMENT OVERVIEW

**Title:** Step 01 Guide - The TruMethods Framework
**Core Methodology:** Five Delivery Areas Framework with Technology Success Culture
**Key Insight:** Breaking free from the Reactive Spiral of Death requires implementing five distinct delivery areas (Professional Services, Centralized Services, TAM, vCIO, Support) with proper leverage ratios and achieving 70% gross margins through strategic pricing.
**Impact on Venturer Technology:** This framework directly addresses your transformation from $45/seat to $150/seat pricing by establishing the operational foundation needed to command premium prices while reducing reactive support time.

## 10-YEAR PLAN INTEGRATION

### Current Plan Alignment:
- ✓ Five Delivery Areas directly support transformation from hybrid to pure MSP model
- ✓ RHEM reduction enables scaling without proportional staff increase
- ✓ Technology Success culture aligns with "Fiercely Protect Our Clients" value
- ✓ Leverage ratios validate 6-person team can support $3M revenue
- ✓ 70% margin target aligns with pricing transformation goals

### Identified Gaps:
- ⚠️ Current discovery session doesn't explicitly reference TruMethods methodology
- ⚠️ Missing specific RHEM targets in Scorecard metrics
- ⚠️ No defined Technology Alignment Manager role in current structure
- ⚠️ vCIO service offering not explicitly planned in revenue projections
- ⚠️ Centralized Services automation not detailed in operational plan

### Potential Conflicts:
- ⚠️ First hire timing (Q1 2026) may need acceleration to implement five areas
- ⚠️ Current 3-person team cannot properly cover all five delivery areas
- ⚠️ $45 to $150/seat jump may require intermediate pricing tiers
- ⚠️ Social mission hiring may conflict with technical skill requirements

### Recommended Plan Updates:
1. Add RHEM metric to L10 Scorecard (target: <60 min by end of 2026)
2. Create Q1 2026 Rock: "Implement TruMethods Five Delivery Areas"
3. Update VTO Page 2 to include TAM and vCIO roles explicitly
4. Add Technology Success standards to operational processes
5. Include Macro/Micro Picanomics in financial planning models
6. Define leverage targets for each delivery area in hiring plan
7. Create pricing transformation roadmap with three tiers ($95/$130/$150)

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Critical Dependencies:
1. **First hire must be technical** to enable delivery area separation (Q1 2026)
2. **PSA/RMM standardization** required before Centralized Services launch
3. **RHEM baseline** must be established before improvement targets
4. **Technology standards** must exist before TAM role activation
5. **Gross margin validation** required before pricing changes

### Resource Requirements:
- **People:** First hire ($65-75k) focused on Centralized Services/Support
- **Tools:** Enhanced RMM licensing (~$2k/month additional)
- **Training:** TruMethods certification for Rick ($5-10k)
- **Time:** 20-30% of Rick's time for first 90 days on framework
- **Capital:** None beyond normal operations

### Risk Factors:
- **Client pushback** on price increases without demonstrable value improvement
- **Team resistance** to structured delivery model vs. current "everyone does everything"
- **Skill gaps** in current team for specialized roles (especially vCIO)
- **Market acceptance** of premium pricing in charity/not-for-profit sector
- **Capacity constraints** during transition with only 3 team members

### Quick Wins:
1. **RHEM calculation** - Immediate visibility into biggest problem (1 day effort)
2. **Top 5 reactive issues** - Quick standardization targets (2-3 days)
3. **Centralized patching** - Immediate time savings (1 week implementation)
4. **Onboarding checklist** - Reduce new client setup by 30% (1 week)
5. **Price new contracts at $95** - Immediate margin improvement (next new client)

### Team Capacity:
- **Rick:** 30% on framework, 70% on business operations/sales
- **Kristyn:** 20% on financial modeling, 80% on current operations
- **Dean:** 40% on standardization, 60% on support delivery
- **New Hire (Q1):** 100% on Centralized Services and Support overflow

## Key Metrics to Track

- RHEM (target: reduce 5% monthly)
- Tickets per endpoint (target: <0.5/month)
- Centralized Services uptime (target: 99.9%)
- Professional Services utilization (target: 80%)

### Monthly:
- AISP for new contracts (target: $95+ in 2026, $130+ in 2027)
- Gross margin per delivery area
- Endpoint standardization percentage
- Technology Success alignment score

### Quarterly (Rocks):

- Revenue per employee
- MRR growth rate

## Conclusion

The TruMethods Framework provides the exact operational blueprint Venturer Technology needs to transform from a reactive $45/seat provider to a proactive $150/seat Technology Success partner. By implementing the Five Delivery Areas with proper leverage ratios and achieving 70% gross margins, you'll escape the Reactive Spiral of Death and build a World Class MSP.

The framework validates that your 10-year vision is not only achievable but follows a proven path used by hundreds of successful MSPs. Your immediate focus should be on measuring RHEM, establishing Centralized Services, and beginning the pricing transformation with new clients.

Most critically, this framework shows that your planned transformation from 30% to 80% recurring revenue is directly tied to reducing reactive work through Technology Success - making the TruMethods Framework not just helpful, but essential to achieving your 10-year target of becoming Queensland's most trusted MSP partner for charities.
