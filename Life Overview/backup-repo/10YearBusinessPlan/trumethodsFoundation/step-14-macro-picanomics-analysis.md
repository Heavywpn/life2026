# TruMethods Step 14: Macro Picanomics - Implementation Roadmap for Venturer Technology

## DOCUMENT OVERVIEW

**Title:** Step 14 Guide - Macro Picanomics (TruMethods Framework Foundations)

**Core Methodology:** Macro Picanomics - A framework for achieving operational efficiency by understanding the relationship between service delivery roles, revenue leverage, and cost structures across five delivery areas (Professional Services, Centralized Services, Technology Alignment, vCIO, Support)

**Key Insight:** MSPs fail to achieve profitability targets because they don't understand the leverage ratios between resources and revenue. By implementing proper role-to-revenue ratios and reducing reactive support noise (RHEM), MSPs can transform from 15% to 50%+ margins.

**Impact on Venturer Technology:** This framework directly addresses Venturer's critical challenge of increasing pricing from $45/seat to $150/seat while improving margins from 15% to 25-50% without adding staff. The methodology provides the exact blueprint for restructuring service delivery to achieve these targets.

## 10-YEAR PLAN INTEGRATION

### Current Plan Alignment:
- ✓ Pricing transformation goal ($45→$150) directly supported by Picanomics model
- ✓ Margin improvement target (15%→50%) achievable through leverage ratios
- ✓ Focus on recurring revenue aligns with MRR-centric measurements
- ✓ Small team constraint addressed through efficiency focus
- ✓ Social mission compatible with operational excellence

### Identified Gaps:
- ⚠️ Current discovery session lacks specific RHEM targets
- ⚠️ No mention of five delivery areas in strategic planning
- ⚠️ Missing leverage ratio tracking in current scorecard plans
- ⚠️ Professional services revenue not separated from MRR planning
- ⚠️ Centralized services function not defined in current structure

### Potential Conflicts:
- ⚠️ Current $45/seat pricing is below sustainable cost structure
- ⚠️ 30% recurring revenue means 70% is variable/unpredictable
- ⚠️ Reactive support model conflicts with scalability goals
- ⚠️ Current margins don't support planned investments

### Recommended Plan Updates:
1. Add "Reduce RHEM to 0.25 hours" as Q2 2026 Company Rock
2. Include five delivery areas in organizational structure planning
3. Add leverage metrics to weekly L10 Scorecard (revenue/employee, MRR/resource)
4. Separate NRR from MRR in all financial projections
5. Create dedicated Rocks for each delivery area implementation
6. Update pricing strategy to include micro/macro Picanomics validation
7. Add "Unrealized Profitability" as monthly executive metric
8. Include support desk efficiency in Issues List for immediate focus

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Critical Dependencies:
1. **Accurate data collection** - Must have clean ticket, time, and financial data
2. **Team buy-in** - All three owners must understand and commit to model
3. **Client communication** - Pricing changes require careful positioning
4. **Technology stack** - Tools must support centralized services model
5. **Process documentation** - Standardization required before optimization

### Resource Requirements:
- **People:** No new hires for first 6 months (focus on efficiency first)
- **Budget:** $15-20K for dashboard/reporting tools
- **Tools:** PSA optimization, RMM consolidation, documentation platform
- **Training:** 40 hours TruMethods methodology training for team
- **Time:** 20% capacity dedicated to transformation initiatives

### Risk Factors:
- **Client resistance** to price increases if value not demonstrated
- **Team overwhelm** during transition period
- **Data quality** issues preventing accurate measurements
- **Market conditions** affecting growth targets
- **Competitive pressure** on pricing during transformation

### Quick Wins:
1. **RHEM calculation** - Immediate visibility into biggest problem
2. **Cost per seat analysis** - Validates pricing requirements
3. **Leverage dashboard** - Simple spreadsheet version in Week 1
4. **Role clarity session** - 3-hour meeting eliminates confusion
5. **First TAM schedule** - Pick top 5 clients for monthly rhythms

### Team Capacity:
- **Rick:** Focus on strategy, pricing, client communication (30% capacity)
- **Kristyn:** Lead financial analysis, dashboard creation (25% capacity)
- **Dean:** Own technical efficiency, RHEM reduction (40% capacity)
- **Combined:** Weekly 1-hour Picanomics review in L10 meetings

## KEY FORMULAS AND TARGETS

### Unrealized Profitability Calculation
```
(Number of employees × $150,000) - Annual service revenue = Unrealized profitability
Current: (3 × $150,000) - $1,000,000 = -$550,000 (negative = overperforming)
Target Year 3: (6 × $150,000) - $3,000,000 = -$2,100,000 (3.3x improvement)
```

### RHEM Calculation
```
RHEM = Tickets per end user per month × Average resolution time
Current: Needs measurement (estimate: 0.75-1.0 hours)
Year 1 Target: 0.5 hours
Year 3 Target: 0.25 hours
```

### Leverage Targets by Delivery Area
- **Professional Services:** 1 per $22K+ monthly NRR (85% utilization at $175/hour)
- **Centralized Services:** 1 per 5,000+ endpoints
- **Technology Alignment:** 1 per $70K+ MRR
- **vCIO:** 1 per $140K+ MRR
- **Support:** 1 per $60K+ MRR

### Cost per Seat Breakdown (Target)
- Support: $15/seat
- Centralized Services: $20/seat
- Technology Alignment: $11/seat
- vCIO: $6/seat
- **Total:** $52/seat (30% margin at $74/seat, 70% margin at $174/seat)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Macro Picanomics framework provides Venturer Technology with a mathematical model proving that their transformation goals are not only achievable but inevitable when proper leverage ratios are implemented. The framework reveals that Venturer is currently operating at approximately 30% of potential efficiency, with an unrealized profitability gap that can be closed through systematic improvements.

The path forward requires:
1. **Immediate focus on RHEM reduction** from an estimated 0.5+ hours to 0.25 hours per user per month
2. **Implementation of five delivery areas** with proper leverage ratios
3. **Systematic pricing increases** justified by operational improvements
4. **Continuous measurement and optimization** using SMART numbers

Most critically, this framework demonstrates that Venturer can achieve their 3-year revenue target of $3M with just 6 employees if they reach industry-standard leverage ratios of $150K revenue per employee and $250K per technical resource. The 10-year vision of financial freedom becomes a mathematical certainty rather than an aspirational goal.

The implementation requires no additional investment beyond time and discipline. By following the TruMethods framework progressively over 36 months, Venturer Technology will transform from a break-even retail/repair shop into a world-class managed services provider with 50%+ margins, premium pricing, and the capacity to serve their social mission at scale.
