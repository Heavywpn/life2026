# TruMethods Step 10: Packaging & Pricing Workshop - Implementation Roadmap

## DOCUMENT OVERVIEW
**Title:** TruMethods Framework Foundations - Step 10: Packaging & Pricing Workshop

## 10-YEAR PLAN INTEGRATION

### Current Plan Alignment:
- ✓ Pricing transformation goal ($45 → $150/seat) directly addressed
- ✓ Standardization approach supports scaling without proportional staff growth
- ✓ Focus on reducing complexity aligns with 3-person team constraints
- ✓ Bundle approach matches charity/non-profit buyer preferences
- ✓ Monthly payment options reduce barriers for target verticals

### Identified Gaps:
- ⚠️ Current V/TO lacks specific packaging standardization milestones
- ⚠️ Discovery session missing detailed pricing migration timeline
- ⚠️ No documented plan for handling client resistance to price increases
- ⚠️ Scorecard needs AISP and bundle adoption rate metrics
- ⚠️ Sales process documentation not detailed enough for "staying on track"

### Potential Conflicts:
- ⚠️ Current customer-first approach may resist standardization initially
- ⚠️ Existing client expectations of customization need careful management
- ⚠️ Team capacity for simultaneous standardization and growth
- ⚠️ Risk of client loss during aggressive pricing increases

### Recommended Plan Updates:
1. Add "Service Standardization" as Q1 2026 Company Rock
2. Include AISP tracking in weekly L10 Scorecard (target: $45→$75→$100→$130→$150)
3. Create quarterly pricing review checkpoints in strategic calendar
4. Add "Bundle Adoption Rate" metric to Scorecard (target: 80% by end of Year 1)
5. Document "Staying on Track" checklist for sales conversations
6. Include contract simplification in Q1 2026 operational priorities
7. Add "Variable Cost Ratio" to monthly financial reviews (target: <50% by Year 3)

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
