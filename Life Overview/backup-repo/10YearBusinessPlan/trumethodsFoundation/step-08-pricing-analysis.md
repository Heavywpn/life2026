# TruMethods Step 8: Pricing Your Service Offering - Implementation Roadmap

## DOCUMENT OVERVIEW

**Title:** Pricing Your Service Offering (Step 8 - TruMethods Framework Foundations)

**Core Methodology:** Picanomics - A systematic approach to MSP pricing that maximizes Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) through strategic All-In Seat Price (AISP) optimization

**Key Insight:** The two most critical levers for MSP success are maximizing average AISP and average MRR. When these work together correctly, you can achieve 2x industry best-in-class performance.

**Impact on Venturer Technology:** This directly addresses Venturer's core transformation goal of moving from $45/seat to $150/seat pricing while improving margins from 15% to 25-50%. The methodology provides the exact framework needed to justify and implement this pricing transformation.

## 10-YEAR PLAN INTEGRATION

### Current Plan Alignment:
- ✓ Directly addresses $45→$150/seat transformation goal
- ✓ Provides framework for 30%→80% recurring revenue shift
- ✓ Aligns with values-based approach (Fiercely Protect = comprehensive service)
- ✓ Supports financial freedom objective through higher margins
- ✓ Compatible with EOS implementation (metrics, accountability)

### Identified Gaps:
- ⚠️ Current V/TO lacks specific pricing strategy details
- ⚠️ No documented plan for managing client resistance to price increases
- ⚠️ Missing competitive analysis for Queensland charity MSP market
- ⚠️ Need clearer connection between pricing and social mission
- ⚠️ Scorecard needs AISP and average MRR metrics added

### Potential Conflicts:
- ⚠️ Charity clients may resist higher pricing - need value justification
- ⚠️ Team capacity during transition period (only 3 people)
- ⚠️ Risk of client churn during pricing transitions
- ⚠️ Current 15% margins may not support transition investments

### Recommended Plan Updates:
1. **VTO-venturer-technology.md**: Add specific pricing targets to 1-Year Plan ($130-150 AISP)
2. **strategic-overview-1-page.md**: Include Picanomics metrics in success measures
3. **rocks/company-rocks.md**: Add Q1 2026 Rock: "Implement new pricing model"
4. **meetings/l10-meeting-notes.md**: Add weekly AISP and MRR tracking to Scorecard
5. **discovery-session.md**: Document pricing strategy decisions in Section 5

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Critical Dependencies:
1. **Must complete cost analysis before setting prices** - without understanding true delivery costs, pricing will be guesswork
2. **Value proposition must be clear before price increases** - clients need to understand what they're paying for
3. **New clients first, then transitions** - prove model before risking existing revenue
4. **Team buy-in essential** - all three partners must believe in value to sell it
5. **First hire critical for capacity** - cannot execute transition with current team size

### Resource Requirements:
- **People**: First hire Q1 2026 ($60K budgeted), pricing consultant consideration ($5K)
- **Technology**: CRM/PSA upgrade to track AISP metrics ($200/month)
- **Training**: TruMethods advanced pricing workshop for team ($3K)
- **Time**: 200+ hours over first 90 days for full implementation
- **Capital**: Working capital for potential revenue dip during transitions ($50K reserve)

### Risk Factors:
- **Client churn**: 10-20% potential loss during transition (plan for it)
- **Cash flow gap**: Higher prices may mean longer sales cycles initially
- **Team confidence**: Asking for 3x current prices requires conviction
- **Market resistance**: Charity sector particularly price-sensitive
- **Competitive response**: Competitors may undercut during transition

### Quick Wins:
1. **Raise prices for all new clients immediately** - no legacy expectations
2. **Add base fee to smallest clients** - quick AISP improvement
3. **Bundle current add-ons into base price** - instant value perception increase
4. **Stop discounting immediately** - every discount undermines transformation
5. **Focus on financial services vertical first** - less price sensitive

### Team Capacity:
- **Rick**: Lead pricing strategy and client communications (40% time)
- **Kristyn**: Financial analysis and tracking (30% time)
- **Dean**: Technical delivery optimization (30% time)
- **Note**: May need to pause some activities until Q1 hire arrives

## PICANOMICS FRAMEWORK SUMMARY

### The Two Critical Levers:
1. **Average AISP** (All-In Seat Price): Target $150-250 for FFF model
2. **Average MRR** (Monthly Recurring Revenue): Minimum $1,800 per client

### Pricing Model Decision Tree:
- **Full Fixed Fee (FFF)**: $150-250 AISP - Best for full-service commitment
- **Partial Fixed Fee (PFF)**: $125-200 AISP - Good transition model
- **Co-Managed Services (CMS)**: $90+ AISP - Only for large orgs with internal IT

### Key Success Principles:
1. **Never compete on price** - Charging less doesn't save clients money
2. **Price on value, not components** - Avoid device-based pricing
3. **Protect margins with minimums** - Set $1,800 minimum MRR
4. **Focus on averages** - Some clients higher, some lower, aim for target average
5. **Don't share pricing complexity** - Keep calculations internal

### Implementation Sequence:
1. Understand your costs
2. Define your value
3. Choose your model
4. Set your minimums
5. Build your calculator
6. Test your assumptions
7. Launch with new clients
8. Transition existing clients
9. Optimize continuously
10. Lead the market

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Must-Do Actions:
1. **Complete financial analysis before any pricing changes**
2. **Get full team alignment on new pricing strategy**
3. **Document and practice value conversation**
4. **Start with new clients to build confidence**
5. **Track metrics weekly without exception**

### Warning Signs to Monitor:
- Sales cycle lengthening beyond 60 days
- Win rate dropping below 30%
- Client satisfaction scores declining
- Team reluctance to quote new prices
- Excessive customization requests

### Success Indicators:
- New client AISP consistently above $130
- Existing client transitions proceeding smoothly
- Margins improving quarterly
- Team confidence in value proposition
- Pipeline growing despite higher prices
