## 10-YEAR PLAN INTEGRATION

### Current Plan Alignment:
- ✓ Technology Success Practice directly enables $45→$150/seat transformation
- ✓ vCIO/TAM roles align with planned hiring roadmap
- ✓ Standards focus supports "Fiercely Protect Our Clients" core value
- ✓ Strategic advisory model drives recurring revenue from 30% to 45-50%
- ✓ Charity compliance expertise differentiates in target vertical

### Identified Gaps:
- ⚠️ No current standards documentation (critical for premium pricing)
- ⚠️ Missing formal TAM/vCIO role definitions and training
- ⚠️ Lack of strategic business profiles for existing clients
- ⚠️ No systematic alignment review process
- ⚠️ Absence of technology roadmaps justifying value

### Potential Conflicts:
- ⚠️ Time investment in strategic relationships vs. current reactive workload
- ⚠️ Need to say "no" to break/fix work to focus on Technology Success
- ⚠️ Risk of losing low-value clients during transition
- ⚠️ Training investment required before revenue improvement

### Recommended Plan Updates:
1. Add "Technology Success Practice Implementation" as Q1 2026 Company Rock
2. Include TAM certification/training budget in financial projections
3. Update service offerings in VTO to include Standards, Alignment, Impact, Strategy
4. Add "% of clients on Technology Success model" to Scorecard
5. Revise pricing strategy timeline to align with practice maturity
6. Include vCIO/TAM roles in organizational chart planning
7. Add "Strategic Client Relationships" as measurable in V/TO

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Critical Dependencies:
1. Standards must be documented before alignment assessments (Q1 2026)
2. TAM role must be defined before first hire (Q1 2026)
3. Pilot clients must succeed before broader rollout (Q2 2026)
4. Strategic business profiles required before roadmaps (Q1 2026)
5. Team buy-in essential before client communication (Immediate)

### Resource Requirements:
- **People:** 1 FTE TAM by Q1 2026, 2nd vCIO by 2027
- **Budget:** $15-20K for TruMethods training/certification
- **Tools:** Alignment assessment platform ($500/month)
- **Training:** 40 hours per team member in Year 1
- **Time:** 20% of Rick's time shifting to vCIO role immediately

### Risk Factors:
- Client resistance to strategic conversations (mitigate with pilot program)
- Team capacity during transition (hire TAM early)
- Pricing pushback from existing clients (grandfather rates temporarily)
- Complexity overwhelming small team (phase implementation)
- Loss of break/fix revenue before strategic revenue replaces it

### Quick Wins:
1. Document standards (immediate credibility boost)
2. 5 pilot clients at higher pricing (proof of concept)
3. First strategic roadmap delivered (tangible value demonstration)
4. Security assessment for charities (immediate differentiation)
5. First successful QBR (relationship transformation)

### Team Capacity:
- Rick: 30% time to vCIO role immediately, 50% by Q2 2026
- Dean: Lead standards development while maintaining operations
- Kristyn: Own client communication about service evolution
- New TAM: Critical hire to prevent team overload
