# TruMethods Step 5: Inventory of Time - Implementation Roadmap

## DOCUMENT OVERVIEW

**Title:** Step 5 Guide - Inventory of Time (TruMethods Framework Foundations)
**Core Methodology:** RHEM (Reactive Hours per End User per Month) optimization through systematic time inventory management and delivery area segmentation
**Key Insight:** Technical time is finite inventory with no shelf life - reducing reactive noise from 1.0 to 0.25 RHEM enables 3.3x pricing leverage and 70% gross margins
**Impact on Venturer Technology:** Direct path from current $45/seat to target $150/seat pricing by reducing RHEM and implementing structured delivery areas

## 10-YEAR PLAN INTEGRATION

### Current Plan Alignment:
✓ Pricing transformation goal ($45→$150) directly supported by RHEM framework
✓ Focus on operational efficiency aligns with margin improvement targets
✓ Charity vertical focus benefits from demonstrable service quality metrics
✓ Team growth plan (3→6 people) matches delivery area requirements

### Identified Gaps:
⚠️ Current discovery-session.md lacks specific RHEM targets and timeline
⚠️ V/TO missing Technology Success process milestones
⚠️ No current tracking of tickets per user per month
⚠️ Delivery area definitions not formalized in strategic documents
⚠️ Cost per seat calculations not integrated into financial planning

### Potential Conflicts:
⚠️ Current 30% recurring revenue may indicate reactive-heavy client base
⚠️ Veterans/disability hiring may require extended training for technical roles
⚠️ Referral-based growth model may conflict with firing high-RHEM clients

### Recommended Plan Updates:
1. Add RHEM targets to VTO-venturer-technology.md 1-Year Plan: "Achieve 0.25 RHEM"
2. Update strategic-overview-1-page.md with delivery area structure diagram
3. Create Q1 2026 Rock: "Implement RHEM tracking and reduce to 0.5 hours"
4. Add weekly Scorecard metrics: RHEM, Tickets/User/Month, Same-Day Close %
5. Revise pricing timeline to align with RHEM milestones rather than arbitrary dates

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Critical Dependencies:
1. **Ticket system data accuracy** - Without clean historical data, RHEM calculations will be flawed
2. **Team buy-in on role separation** - Everyone must respect delivery area boundaries
3. **Client cooperation** - High-RHEM clients must improve or be transitioned out
4. **Financial cushion** - May need to fire unprofitable clients before adding new ones
5. **PSA/RMM tool capabilities** - May require tool upgrades for proper tracking

### Resource Requirements:
- **People:** First hire must be dedicated support (not hybrid role) - $45-50K
- **Tools:** Enhanced PSA reporting capabilities - $200-500/month
- **Training:** TruMethods Framework certification - $5,000
- **Time:** 20% of team capacity for first 90 days on implementation
- **Budget:** $15,000 for tools, training, and implementation support

### Risk Factors:
- **Client resistance** to proactive service model (mitigation: education and proof of value)
- **Team burnout** during transition (mitigation: phase implementation over quarters)
- **Cash flow impact** from firing bad clients (mitigation: overlap with new client acquisition)
- **Skill gaps** in proactive delivery areas (mitigation: training budget and timeline)
- **Market acceptance** of higher pricing (mitigation: demonstrate value through metrics)

### Quick Wins:
1. **Immediate RHEM calculation** - Know your starting point within 1 week
2. **Stop noise permeation** - Route all reactive tickets to support queue immediately
3. **Fire worst RHEM client** - Send strong message about new standards
4. **Implement same-day close metric** - Quick morale boost and client satisfaction
5. **Calculate true cost per seat** - Often shocking revelation drives urgency

### Team Capacity:
- Current 3-person constraint requires phased approach
- Rick: 20% time on RHEM initiative (strategy and client management)
- Kristyn: 15% time on financial modeling and metrics
- Dean: 40% time on operational implementation and tracking
- First hire critical to relieve reactive pressure and enable transformation

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Must-Have Metrics:
1. **RHEM** - Track weekly, report monthly, target quarterly improvements
2. **Tickets per End User per Month** - Industry benchmark: 0.5 or less
3. **Average Resolution Time** - Target: 30 minutes or less
4. **Same-Day Close Percentage** - Target: 80% or higher
5. **Proactive vs Reactive Time Split** - Target: 75% proactive minimum

### Key Frameworks to Implement:
1. **Delivery Area Model:**
   - Support (Reactive) - 25% of technical time
   - Centralized Services - 25% of technical time
   - Technology Alignment - 30% of technical time
   - vCIO - 15% of technical time
   - Professional Services - 5% of technical time

2. **Micro Picanomics Formula:**
   - Total Cost per Seat × 3.33 = Minimum AISP for 70% margin
   - Current: $52 cost requires $174 AISP
   - Target: Reduce cost to $45 for $150 AISP at 70% margin

3. **Support Leverage Calculation:**
   - Seats Managed per Resource × AISP = Support Desk Leverage
   - Current estimate: 160 seats × $45 = $7,200 (poor)
   - Target: 640 seats × $150 = $96,000 (excellent)

### Technology Success Integration:
- RHEM reduction enables Technology Success delivery
- Technology Success delivery further reduces RHEM (virtuous cycle)
- Lower RHEM justifies premium pricing
- Premium pricing funds better tools and people
- Better tools and people drive RHEM even lower

This framework provides Venturer Technology with a clear, measurable path from reactive chaos to proactive excellence, directly enabling the transformation from $1M to $3M revenue and 15% to 30% profit margins.
