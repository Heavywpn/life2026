# PAGE 1: VISION

## 1. CORE VALUES

### FIERCELY PROTECT OUR CLIENTS

We don't just fix technology—we actively protect clients from threats both external and internal. We provide honest advice even when it doesn't generate immediate revenue. We say "no" to clients when something isn't in their best interest. We stand between clients and problems as advocates, not just service providers.

**Why It Matters:** Creates deep trust that justifies premium pricing, differentiates us from transactional MSPs, and aligns perfectly with our NFP/charity and financial services verticals who need trusted partners.

### GROW WITH OUR CLIENTS

We view customer relationships as true partnerships where their success is our success. We actively seek ways to grow our business alongside our clients' growth. We measure success by customer outcomes, not just tickets closed. We invest in long-term relationships over short-term transactions.

**Why It Matters:** Creates stickiness and reduces churn, generates organic expansion revenue, positions us as trusted advisors embedded in their strategic planning, and enables premium pricing through value-based services.

### COMMUNITY AND SACRIFICE MINDSET

We hire team members who demonstrate community service and willingness to sacrifice for something greater than themselves. We actively employ veterans, people with disabilities, and survivors. We contribute to our community through Core Computers and plan to formalize this through a foundation.

**Why It Matters:** Creates authentic culture that attracts mission-aligned customers and team members, differentiates us in a commoditized market, builds deep community relationships that generate referrals, and aligns with customers' values (especially NFP/charity sector).

## 2. CORE FOCUS

### Purpose/Cause/Passion

**Empowering mission-driven organizations to focus on their purpose by providing technology leadership they can trust completely.**

We exist to free charities, nonprofits, and values-aligned businesses from technology worry so they can maximize their mission impact. We believe technology should enable mission work, not distract from it.

### Niche

**Premium managed services and strategic technology advisory (vCIO) for charities, nonprofits, and financial services organizations (5-300 seats) in Queensland, Australia, who value partnership over transactions.**

We specialize in organizations that need both technical excellence and values alignment—where protecting sensitive data, maintaining mission focus, and partnering with a trusted advisor matters more than finding the lowest price.

---

## 3. 10-YEAR TARGET

**By 2035:**

Queensland's most trusted MSP partner for charities and mission-driven organizations, operating as a self-sustaining business no longer dependent on any single person or customer, generating profits that fund Rick and Kristyn's freedom and create enduring financial security for their sons, Ronin and Parker.

---

## 4. MARKETING STRATEGY

### Target Market

**Primary:** Charities, nonprofits, and mission-driven organizations (5-50 seats sweet spot, capable of serving up to 300 seats) in Queensland, Australia

**Secondary:** Financial services firms requiring high trust, data security, and relationship-focused IT partnership

**Ideal Customer Profile:**
- Values partnership and mission alignment over lowest price
- Recognizes IT as strategic business enabler, not overhead
- Willing to invest in proactive protection and planning
- Seeks long-term relationship with trusted advisor
- 5-300 employees (sweet spot: 5-50 seats)

### Three Uniques

**1. Mission-Aligned Partnership:**
We share your values through our community hiring mission (veterans, people with disabilities, survivors). We don't just serve charities—we operate like one, creating employment pathways and community impact.

**2. Bundled vCIO Strategic Advisory:**
Unlike competitors who charge separately for vCIO services, we include strategic technology planning, quarterly business reviews, and proactive roadmapping in our managed services—making us your technology leadership team, not just your IT vendor.

**3. Fierce Protection Philosophy:**
We're measured by how well we protect you from both external threats (security, downtime) and internal staff technology issues—our success is your peace of mind, enabling you to focus entirely on your mission.

### Proven Process

**DEFERRED:** Marketing process and messaging refinement scheduled for future team development session. Year 1 focus is relationship-based selling through networking and referrals while building service documentation.

### Guarantee

**DEFERRED:** Guarantee framework to be developed alongside marketing strategy refinement in future planning session.
