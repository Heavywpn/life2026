## SESSION GROUND RULES

### Effective Collaboration Principles

1. **No rank in the room**: All voices are equal during this session. The best idea wins, regardless of who suggests it.
2. **Start on time, end on time**: Respect everyone's time by maintaining the schedule.
3. **One conversation at a time**: No side discussions or devices (laptops closed except for note-taking).
4. **Disagree and commit**: Healthy debate is encouraged, but once a decision is made, everyone commits fully.
5. **Focus on the business**: Leave personal frustrations at the door; focus on what's best for Venturer Technology.
6. **Action-oriented mindset**: We're here to make decisions and create accountability, not just discuss.

### Decision-Making Protocol

**When the team disagrees:**
1. **First**: Discuss pros/cons openly (5 minutes max per issue)
2. **Second**: If no consensus, Rick makes the call (Visionary has final say on strategic priorities)
3. **Third**: Everyone commits to the decision, even if it wasn't their preference
4. **Fourth**: Track the decision as an experiment; revisit in 30-60 days if needed

**Parking Lot for Off-Topic Items:**
- Kristyn maintains a "Parking Lot" list for important topics that arise but are outside this session's scope
- These items will be added to the Issues List or scheduled for future discussion

## MEETING AGENDA

### PART 1: SESSION OPENING (15 minutes)
**Timing**: 9:00am - 9:15am

#### Welcome & Context Setting (5 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick

**Script for Rick:**
> "Thank you both for investing this time today. Over the past few weeks, I've been working through a comprehensive discovery process that has crystallized our vision and strategy. The V/TO document you reviewed captures where we've been, where we are, and where we're going.
>
> Today is about translating that vision into TRACTION - the practical, week-by-week execution that will make it real. We're going to set our first quarter's priorities (Rocks), identify what's blocking us (Issues List), define how we'll measure progress (Scorecard), and establish our meeting rhythm (L10 Meetings).
>
> This isn't me telling you what to do. This is us building our execution plan TOGETHER. Your insights, your priorities, your obstacles - they all matter equally in this room."

#### Review V/TO Vision (Page 1) (8 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick

**Activity**: Quick review of foundational elements
- **Core Values** (2 minutes): Read aloud Fiercely Protect Our Clients, Grow With Our Clients, Community and Sacrifice Mindset
- **Core Focus** (2 minutes): Review Purpose ("Empowering mission-driven organizations...") and Niche (charities/NFP/financial services)
- **10-Year Target** (1 minute): Queensland's most trusted MSP for charities, self-sustaining business, freedom for family
- **3-Year Picture** (2 minutes): $3M revenue, 6 staff, new office, Rick exited help desk, 45-50% recurring revenue
- **1-Year Plan** (1 minute): $1.5M revenue, first hire Q1, pricing transformation, Profit First implementation

**Ask**: "Any questions or concerns about the Vision before we move to Traction?"

#### Explain Session Purpose (2 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Today we complete Page 2 of the V/TO (Traction)
- Four distinct activities: Rocks → Issues List → Scorecard → Meeting Pulse
- Each activity builds on the previous one
- By end of session, we'll be ready to start L10 meetings in January
- This is the foundation for the entire Year 1 transformation

---

### PART 2: SET Q1 2026 ROCKS (60 minutes)
**Timing**: 9:15am - 10:15am

#### What Are Rocks? (10 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick

**Explanation**:
> "Rocks are the 3-7 MOST IMPORTANT priorities for the next 90 days. They're called 'Rocks' because of Stephen Covey's analogy: if you fill a jar with sand first (small daily tasks), you can't fit the big rocks (important priorities). But if you put the big rocks in first, the sand fills in around them.
>
> In EOS, Rocks are our forcing function for prioritization. We can't do everything at once, but we CAN do 3-7 critical things every 90 days."

**Rock Criteria (MUST meet ALL of these):**
1. **90-Day Timeframe**: Completable within Q1 2026 (January 1 - March 31)
2. **Specific & Measurable**: Crystal clear when it's "done" (binary yes/no completion)
3. **Assigned Owner**: ONE person responsible (not shared ownership)
4. **Company or Individual**: Either supports company priorities OR supports role responsibilities
5. **High Impact**: Moves us meaningfully toward 1-Year Plan goals

**Examples of GOOD Rocks:**
- ✅ "Profit First Implementation Complete" (Owner: Kristyn, Done by: March 31)
- ✅ "First Hire Recruited and Offer Extended" (Owner: Rick, Done by: February 28)
- ✅ "5 Core Processes Documented Using Template" (Owner: Kristyn, Done by: March 31)
- ✅ "10 Consecutive Weekly L10 Meetings Completed" (Owner: Rick, Done by: March 31)

**Examples of BAD Rocks:**
- ❌ "Improve customer service" (Not measurable, no completion criteria)
- ❌ "Grow revenue" (Ongoing activity, not specific 90-day outcome)
- ❌ "Work on marketing" (Vague, no clear definition of "done")
- ❌ "Fix all our problems" (Too broad, unrealistic for 90 days)

#### Brainstorm Potential Rocks (20 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick
**Activity**: Open brainstorming session

**Process**:
1. **Silent brainstorming** (5 minutes): Everyone writes their top priority ideas on sticky notes (one Rock per note)
2. **Share and post** (10 minutes): Each person shares their ideas, posts on flip chart, explains why it matters
3. **Clarifying questions only** (5 minutes): Ask questions to understand, not debate yet

**Rick's Facilitation Prompts:**
- "What MUST be accomplished in Q1 to set up Year 1 success?"
- "What's blocking us right now that needs to be solved?"
- "What foundation needs to be built in Q1 for Q2-Q4 to work?"
- "If we could only accomplish 3-5 things in Q1, what would move the needle most?"

**Reference Point - Year 1 Priorities to Consider:**
- EOS implementation (L10 meetings, Rocks rhythm, Scorecard tracking)
- First hire (recruitment, onboarding, training)
- Profit First implementation (account structure, allocation percentages, discipline)
- Process documentation (templates, core workflows, knowledge transfer)
- Pricing strategy foundation (new customer pricing locked in, legacy increase planning)
- Break/fix conversion preparation (communication strategy, conversion offers)
- Revenue growth ($375k target for Q1 as part of $1.5M annual goal)

#### Prioritize to 3-7 Company Rocks (15 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick
**Activity**: Ruthless prioritization

**Process**:
1. **Group similar ideas** (3 minutes): Cluster related sticky notes together
2. **Eliminate low-priority items** (5 minutes): Move "nice to have" items to Issues List or future quarters
3. **Vote on top priorities** (5 minutes): Each person gets 5 votes (can stack on same item)
4. **Select 3-7 Company Rocks** (2 minutes): Choose top vote-getters that meet Rock criteria

**Decision Criteria Questions:**
- "Does this HAVE to happen in Q1, or could it wait until Q2?"
- "Will this directly support the 1-Year Plan goals?"
- "Is this achievable with our current capacity plus the first hire?"
- "Does this build foundation for later quarters?"

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Too many Rocks (more than 7 = diluted focus)
- Rocks that are really ongoing activities disguised as projects
- Rocks without clear completion criteria
- Rocks that depend on things outside our control

#### Assign Owners & Define "Done" (10 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick
**Activity**: Create accountability and clarity

**For Each Rock:**
1. **Assign ONE owner**: Who is responsible for ensuring this Rock gets done?
2. **Define completion criteria**: What does "done" look like specifically?
3. **Identify 1-2 key milestones**: How will we track progress in L10 meetings?

**Template for Each Rock:**

**Rock**: [Specific outcome to be achieved]
**Owner**: [Rick / Kristyn / Dean]
**Due Date**: March 31, 2026 (or earlier if Q1 milestone)
**Done Looks Like**: [Specific, measurable completion criteria]
**Weekly Check**: [How we'll track progress in L10s - percentage, milestones, binary status]

**Example - Fully Defined Rock:**

**Rock**: Profit First Implementation Complete
**Owner**: Kristyn
**Due Date**: March 31, 2026
**Done Looks Like**:
- 5 bank accounts set up (Income, Profit, Owner's Pay, Tax, Operating Expenses)
- Allocation percentages defined for each account
- First 3 months of distributions completed (January, February, March)
- Rick and Kristyn comfortable with process and discipline

**Weekly Check**: Report percentage complete (account setup, allocations defined, distributions executed)

#### Set Individual Rocks (5 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick
**Activity**: Each person commits to 1-3 personal Rocks

**Process**:
- Each leadership team member should have 1-3 Individual Rocks
- Individual Rocks support either Company Rocks OR role-specific priorities
- Apply same criteria: 90 days, measurable, high-impact

**Examples of Individual Rocks:**
- **Rick**: "Extend offer to qualified first hire by February 28" (supports First Hire Company Rock)
- **Kristyn**: "Document 5 core service processes using template by March 31" (supports Process Documentation Company Rock)
- **Dean**: "Reduce average ticket resolution time to <4 hours for L1 issues by March 31" (role-specific operational improvement)

**Capture in V/TO**: Record all Company Rocks + Individual Rocks in Section 7 of V/TO document

### BREAK (10 minutes)
**Timing**: 10:15am - 10:25am

Stand up, stretch, coffee refill. Clear your head before next activity.

---

### PART 3: BUILD ISSUES LIST (30 minutes)
**Timing**: 10:25am - 10:55am

#### What Is the Issues List? (5 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick

**Explanation**:
> "The Issues List is our centralized tracking tool for everything that's blocking us, frustrating us, or representing an opportunity. It's NOT the same as our task list or ticket queue - it's specifically for BUSINESS issues that need strategic discussion and resolution.
>
> In L10 Meetings, we'll spend 60 minutes every week using the IDS framework to solve Issues:
> - **I**dentify: Name the issue clearly
> - **D**iscuss: Get to root cause (not symptoms)
> - **S**olve: Create action items and assign ownership
>
> Issues can be obstacles (blocking progress), opportunities (ideas to pursue), or problems (things broken that need fixing)."

**Types of Issues:**
1. **Obstacles**: "We can't hire because we don't have job descriptions defined"
2. **Opportunities**: "TMT platform could automate our marketing if we invested time in setup"
3. **Problems**: "Customers are frustrated with slow after-hours response times"
4. **Strategic Questions**: "Should we exit retail/repair through Core Computers or transform it?"

**Issues vs. Rocks vs. To-Dos:**
- **Issues**: Require discussion and strategic decision-making → Goes on Issues List for IDS in L10
- **Rocks**: Major 90-day priorities → Tracked separately in Rock review section of L10
- **To-Dos**: Simple action items assigned in L10 meetings → Next week's accountability check

#### Brainstorm Current Issues (15 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick
**Activity**: Rapid-fire identification

**Process**:
1. **Silent brainstorming** (5 minutes): Write down anything blocking you, frustrating you, or representing opportunity
2. **Round-robin sharing** (10 minutes): Each person shares their list, no discussion yet, just capture

**Prompting Questions:**
- "What's frustrating you right now in operations/delivery/customer relationships?"
- "What opportunities are we missing because we don't have time/resources/clarity?"
- "What's broken that we keep working around instead of fixing?"
- "What decisions are we avoiding that need to be made?"
- "What's keeping you up at night about the business?"

**Seed Issues from Discovery Session** (Use These to Prime the Pump):
- Staff performance concerns (difficult conversations needed - from Q40)
- Office space constraints (future relocation planning)
- Marketing message clarity (how to articulate Three Uniques effectively)
- Break/fix customer conversion strategy execution (WHO, WHEN, HOW)
- Offshore team integration and workflow optimization (Robin and Peter)
- New hire training curriculum development (what will first hire need to learn?)
- Revenue tracking by brand (Venturer vs Core - measurement gap)
- Fortified partnership time drain (Is it strategic or distraction?)
- Customer service expectations vs. capacity (saying "no" constructively)
- Values-driven hiring finding candidates with right blend of character and capability

#### Categorize and Prioritize (10 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick
**Activity**: Organize for effective IDS

**Process**:
1. **Group similar Issues** (3 minutes): Cluster related items together
2. **Mark urgency** (3 minutes): Which Issues are blocking Q1 Rocks or causing immediate pain?
3. **Assign to Rocks or Issues List** (4 minutes):
   - If it's a 90-day project → Consider making it a Rock
   - If it needs discussion and decision → Issues List
   - If it's a simple task → Assign as To-Do, don't track on Issues List

**Priority Levels:**
- **🔴 Red (Urgent)**: Blocking current work or causing significant customer/team pain
- **🟡 Yellow (Important)**: Needs resolution in Q1 but not immediately blocking
- **🟢 Green (Future)**: Worth tracking but not Q1 priority

**Issues List Format:**

| Issue | Type | Priority | Owner (if assigned) |
|-------|------|----------|---------------------|
| Staff performance conversations needed | Problem | 🔴 Red | Rick |
| Break/fix conversion communication strategy | Opportunity | 🟡 Yellow | TBD |
| Office space relocation planning | Strategic | 🟢 Green | Kristyn |

**Capture in V/TO**: Record prioritized Issues List in Section 8 of V/TO document

**Note**: Issues List is LIVING - we'll add/remove items weekly in L10 meetings. This is just the starting point.

### PART 4: DEFINE SCORECARD (40 minutes)
**Timing**: 10:55am - 11:35am

#### What Is the Scorecard? (5 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick

**Explanation**:
> "The Scorecard is a short list of 5-15 numbers that tell us the story of our business health EVERY WEEK. These aren't just financial reports we review monthly - they're predictive, early-warning indicators that help us spot problems before they become crises.
>
> Good Scorecard metrics are:
> - **Predictive**: Leading indicators, not just lagging results (e.g., 'sales conversations held' predicts future revenue better than 'revenue this week')
> - **Weekly**: Must be measurable every single week (not quarterly or annual metrics)
> - **Owned**: Each metric has ONE person responsible for tracking and reporting it
> - **Actionable**: If the number goes red, we know what action to take
> - **Simple**: Easy to track, no complex calculations

**Examples of GOOD Scorecard Metrics:**
- ✅ Weekly revenue (leading indicator of monthly/annual performance)
- ✅ New customer conversations held (predicts future sales)
- ✅ % of tickets requiring Rick escalation (predicts when first hire is successfully trained)
- ✅ Aged AR >30 days (early warning for cash flow problems)

**Examples of BAD Scorecard Metrics:**
- ❌ Annual profit margin (too infrequent, lagging)
- ❌ Customer satisfaction (can't measure weekly without survey fatigue)
- ❌ "Everyone is working hard" (not measurable, subjective)
- ❌ Total lifetime customer value (too complex, not actionable weekly)

#### Identify Key Metrics by Category (20 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick
**Activity**: Brainstorm measurables across business functions

**Process**: Go through each category below, identify 2-3 potential metrics per category

---

---

#### Prioritize to 5-15 Metrics (10 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick
**Activity**: Select final Scorecard

**Process**:
1. **Review all brainstormed metrics** (2 minutes): Look at flip chart with all potential metrics
2. **Apply selection criteria** (5 minutes):
   - Can we track this WEEKLY without heroic effort?
   - Does this predict future performance (leading indicator)?
   - Will this number tell us to take specific action when it goes red?
   - Is this a "make or break" number for Year 1 success?
3. **Vote on top 5-15** (3 minutes): Each person picks their top 10, select highest vote-getters

**Target Mix:**
- 2-3 Revenue & Growth metrics
- 2-3 Customer Success metrics
- 2-3 Operations metrics
- 1-2 Financial Health metrics
- 1-2 Team & EOS Execution metrics
- **Total: 10-13 metrics** (sweet spot for weekly review)

#### Assign Owners & Set Goals (5 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick
**Activity**: Create accountability for tracking

**For Each Metric:**
1. **Assign Owner**: Who will track and report this number every week in L10?
2. **Set Weekly Goal**: What's the target we're aiming for?
3. **Define Red/Yellow/Green**: When is this metric concerning vs. healthy?

**Scorecard Template:**

| Metric | Owner | Goal | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 5 |

### BREAK (10 minutes)
**Timing**: 11:35am - 11:45am

Quick break before final activity.

---

### PART 5: ESTABLISH MEETING PULSE (20 minutes)
**Timing**: 11:45am - 12:05pm

#### What Is the Meeting Pulse? (3 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick

**Explanation**:
> "The Meeting Pulse is our commitment to WEEKLY accountability. In EOS, the Level 10 Meeting is the heartbeat that keeps everything else alive. It's 90 minutes, same day/time every week, with a strict agenda that ensures we review our numbers, track our Rocks, and solve our most important Issues.
>
> The name 'Level 10' comes from the goal: every participant should rate the meeting a 10 out of 10 for productivity and effectiveness. If meetings consistently score below 8, something needs to change about the agenda, attendance, or facilitation."

**Why Weekly Matters:**
- Monthly is too slow - problems compound for 4 weeks before discussion
- Daily is too frequent - no time for action between meetings
- Weekly creates rhythm: commit on Monday, execute all week, report next Monday

#### Define L10 Meeting Structure (7 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick
**Activity**: Review standard EOS L10 agenda

**Standard Level 10 Meeting Agenda** (90 minutes total):

**1. SEGUE (5 minutes)**
- Personal and professional good news
- Purpose: Start meeting on positive note, build team connection
- Each person shares one good thing from past week (personal or business)

**2. SCORECARD REVIEW (5 minutes)**
- Review each metric: on track (green), slight concern (yellow), or problem (red)
- Purpose: Spot trends and early warnings
- NO discussion or problem-solving here - just identify red/yellow items
- Red/yellow items get added to Issues List for IDS later

**3. ROCK REVIEW (5 minutes)**
- Each Rock owner reports: on track (green), at risk (yellow), or off track (red)
- Purpose: Ensure 90-day priorities stay visible and accountable
- NO discussion here - just status update
- Off-track Rocks get added to Issues List for IDS

**4. CUSTOMER/EMPLOYEE HEADLINES (5 minutes)**
- Share important updates: customer wins/losses, employee changes, key developments
- Purpose: Keep everyone informed on critical people issues
- Brief headlines only - detailed discussion goes to Issues List

**5. TO-DO LIST REVIEW (5 minutes)**
- Review last week's commitments: done or not done (binary)
- Purpose: Create accountability for commitments made in previous L10
- NOT the place for excuses - just report status
- Incomplete to-dos get added to Issues List if still relevant

**6. IDS - IDENTIFY, DISCUSS, SOLVE (60 minutes)**
- Work through Issues List using IDS framework
- Purpose: Solve the most important problems/opportunities facing the business
- **Identify**: Prioritize top 3-5 Issues for this week's meeting
- **Discuss**: Get to root cause (not just symptoms) - "What's the REAL issue here?"
- **Solve**: Create specific action items with ownership and deadlines → Next week's To-Do List

**7. CONCLUDE (5 minutes)**
- Recap To-Dos for next week (who owns what by when)
- Cascade messages: what needs to be communicated to broader team?
- Rate the meeting 1-10: "How effective was this meeting?"
- Purpose: Ensure clarity and commitment before leaving

**Total**: 90 minutes (use timer to stay on track!)

#### Schedule First L10 Meeting (5 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick
**Activity**: Lock in logistics

**Decisions to Make:**

1. **Day of Week**: [Team decision - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday?]
   - **Recommendation**: Monday or Tuesday morning (sets tone for week, ensures weekend issues are fresh)
   - **Avoid**: Friday afternoon (hard to take action over weekend)

2. **Time**: [Team decision - what time works for Rick, Kristyn, and Dean consistently?]
   - **Recommendation**: Early morning (8:00am-9:30am or 9:00am-10:30am) before daily chaos begins
   - **Avoid**: End of day when energy is low

3. **Location**: [In-person or virtual? Conference room or off-site?]
   - **Recommendation**: In-person if possible (better focus, less distraction)
   - **Virtual option**: Zoom with cameras ON, dedicated quiet space for each person

4. **First Meeting Date**: [Target: First or second week of January 2026]
   - Allows holiday break for rest and preparation
   - Starts Q1 with momentum and accountability

**Team Discussion**: What day/time works for everyone EVERY WEEK without exception?

**Decision**:
- **Day**: _______________
- **Time**: _______________
- **Location**: _______________
- **First L10 Date**: _______________

### PART 6: SESSION CLOSING (15 minutes)
**Timing**: 12:05pm - 12:20pm

#### Review What We Accomplished (5 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick

**Checklist - Did We Complete:**
- ✅ Q1 2026 Rocks defined (3-7 Company Rocks + individual Rocks)
- ✅ Issues List populated with current obstacles and opportunities
- ✅ Scorecard designed with 10-15 weekly metrics, owners, and goals
- ✅ Meeting Pulse established (L10 day/time/location/roles)

**Read Aloud**: Rick reads the final Rocks list and first L10 meeting date to confirm team alignment

**Question**: "Does everyone understand and commit to these priorities and this meeting rhythm?"

#### Confirm First L10 Meeting & Next Steps (5 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick

**Confirmed**:
- **First L10 Meeting**: [Date/Time/Location from Part 5]
- **What happens before then**:
  1. Rick will update V/TO document with today's decisions (Rocks, Issues List, Scorecard, Meeting Pulse)
  2. Kristyn will set up Scorecard tracking spreadsheet/template
  3. Each person will prepare their first Scorecard metrics for Week 1
  4. Everyone will review updated V/TO before first L10

**Pre-First-L10 To-Dos**:

| To-Do | Owner | Due Date |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Update V/TO with session decisions | Rick | [1 week from today] |
| Create Scorecard tracking template | Kristyn | [1 week from today] |
| Populate baseline Scorecard data | All owners | [Before first L10] |
| Read *Traction* Chapter 6 (IDS) | All | [Before first L10] |
| Calendar block for weekly L10s (next 12 weeks) | All | [This week] |

#### Assign Follow-Up Actions (3 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick

**Immediate Next Steps** (beyond L10 preparation):

1. **Parking Lot Items**: Review Kristyn's Parking Lot list - which items become:
   - Issues to add to Issues List?
   - Future discussion topics for L10 IDS?
   - Tasks to delegate immediately?

2. **Communication Plan**: Do we need to communicate any decisions from today to the broader team?
   - Example: "We're implementing weekly leadership meetings starting January"
   - Example: "Our Q1 priorities are X, Y, Z - here's how that affects your work"

3. **Documentation**: Who will ensure the V/TO is accessible to everyone?
   - Print copies for each leadership team member?
   - Share digital version in shared drive?

#### Closing Reflection (2 minutes)
**Facilitator**: Rick

**Questions for Team**:
- "On a scale of 1-10, how clear are you on what we're doing in Q1?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that these Rocks are achievable?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you to the weekly L10 meeting discipline?"

**Final Words from Rick**:
> "Thank you both for your engagement today. What we built here is the foundation for transforming Venturer Technology from owner-dependent to team-driven, from commodity provider to trusted advisor, from 30% recurring revenue to 80% over the next 10 years.
>
> This V/TO is our strategic compass. These Rocks are our next 90-day focus. This Scorecard is our early-warning system. These weekly L10 meetings are our accountability heartbeat.
>
> I'm excited to execute this plan WITH you, not dictate it TO you. Let's make Q1 2026 the quarter we look back on as the turning point."

## FACILITATION TIPS FOR RICK

### Managing Group Dynamics

**If discussion gets off-track:**
- "That's a great topic for the Parking Lot / Issues List. Let's capture it and keep moving."
- "We're spending a lot of time on this. Is it worth making this a Rock, or can we solve it quickly in IDS during an L10?"

**If someone dominates conversation:**
- "Thanks for that perspective. Let's hear from Kristyn/Dean on this."
- Use round-robin format: "Let's go around the table - Rick, then Kristyn, then Dean."

**If team is stuck deciding between options:**
- "Let's each vote on our top choice. If we're split, I'll make the call and we'll commit to trying it for one quarter."
- "What would need to be true for Option A to be the right choice? What about Option B?"

**If energy drops mid-session:**
- Take an unscheduled 5-minute break
- Do a quick physical activity (stand and stretch, walk outside for 2 minutes)
- Shift from analytical discussion to creative brainstorming

### Keeping Session on Schedule

**Use these time reminders:**
- "We have 10 minutes left for this activity. Let's focus on decisions."
- "We're running 5 minutes behind. We can either extend the session or move faster through the next section. Preferences?"
- "This is great discussion, but we need to move to the next topic to finish on time."

**If you're running significantly behind (>15 minutes):**
- Pause and ask team: "Do we extend by 30 minutes, or do we prioritize and cut something?"
- Option 1: Extend session if energy is high and we're making great progress
- Option 2: Cut Issues List to 15 minutes (we can add Issues during L10 meetings)
- Option 3: Simplify Scorecard to 5-7 metrics instead of 10-15 (can expand later)

### Encouraging Full Participation

**To draw out quieter participants:**
- "Kristyn, you've been quiet on this topic. What's your take?"
- "Dean, from your operational perspective, what would make the biggest difference?"
- Direct questions: "Kristyn, which of these financial metrics would give you the most peace of mind?"

**To ensure psychological safety:**
- "There are no bad ideas in brainstorming. Let's get everything on the table."
- "We're not committing to anything yet - just exploring options."
- When someone disagrees: "That's valuable dissent. Tell us more about your concerns."

### Handling Disagreement

**When Rick and Kristyn disagree (Visionary vs. Integrator tension):**
- Acknowledge both perspectives: "Rick's growth focus and Kristyn's profit discipline are BOTH right. How do we honor both?"
- Look for synthesis: "Is there a third option that achieves growth AND maintains margin?"
- Make it explicit: "This is healthy Visionary/Integrator tension. We need both viewpoints."

**When consensus isn't emerging:**
- "We've discussed this for 10 minutes. Let's use our decision protocol: I'll make the call, and we all commit to trying it for Q1. We can revisit at the quarterly review."

## SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR THIS SESSION

### We Will Know This Session Was Successful If:

1. **Complete V/TO Page 2 (Traction)**: All four sections filled in with team input and commitment
2. **Clear Q1 Priorities**: Everyone leaves knowing the 3-7 most important Rocks for next 90 days
3. **Accountability Established**: Owners assigned for every Rock and Scorecard metric
4. **Meeting Rhythm Locked**: First L10 meeting scheduled with 100% commitment to attend
5. **Team Alignment**: Unanimous agreement on priorities and execution plan
6. **Energy Level**: Team leaves energized (not exhausted) and confident about Q1

### Red Flags That Session Needs Adjustment:

- ❌ Team is confused about what Rocks are or why they matter
- ❌ Disagreements about priorities remain unresolved
- ❌ Scorecard feels like busywork rather than useful data
- ❌ Anyone expresses doubt about sustainability of weekly L10 meetings
- ❌ Rick is dictating rather than facilitating collaboration

**If any red flags appear**: PAUSE, address the concern directly, and don't move forward until alignment is restored.

## WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THIS SESSION

### January 2026 - First Month of L10 Meetings

**Week 1** (First L10):
- Expect the meeting to feel awkward and slow
- Focus on following the agenda, not perfection
- Rate the meeting at the end (likely 6-7 out of 10 for first few meetings)

**Week 2-4** (Building Rhythm):
- Meetings get faster as team learns the format
- IDS (Identify, Discuss, Solve) becomes more effective with practice
- Rock status becomes clearer as progress is made

**Week 5-8** (Hitting Stride):
- Meetings should start rating 8-9 out of 10
- Team begins to rely on L10 for decision-making and problem-solving
- Issues are getting SOLVED, not just discussed

**Week 9-12** (Quarterly Review Prep):
- Rock completion should be >80% on track
- Scorecard trends are clear (what's working, what's not)
- Issues List is a living tool being used actively

### March 2026 - First Quarterly Review

**Purpose**: Review Q1 results, celebrate wins, learn from misses, set Q2 2026 Rocks

**Agenda** (Half-day session, 4 hours):
1. **Q1 Rock Review**: Which Rocks got done? Which didn't? Why?
2. **Scorecard Analysis**: What trends did we see? What surprised us?
3. **V/TO Update**: Any adjustments to 1-Year Plan based on Q1 learnings?
4. **Q2 Rock Setting**: What are the next 90-day priorities (April-June 2026)?
5. **Process Improvements**: How can we make L10 meetings even more effective?

### Beyond Q1 - EOS Maturity

**Quarter 2-4 (2026)**: Refine processes, add sophistication to Scorecard, deepen IDS effectiveness
**Year 2 (2027)**: EOS becomes "how we operate" rather than "new thing we're trying"
**Year 3-10**: EOS discipline enables scale, geographic expansion, and mission fulfillment

## FINAL ENCOURAGEMENT

This session is where **Vision becomes Traction**.

The V/TO you've created through the discovery process is inspiring - it paints a clear picture of Venturer Technology transformed: premium pricing, trusted advisor positioning, recurring revenue dominance, Rick freed from help desk work, Kristyn empowered by systems and team, profitable growth funding your family's freedom and a mission-driven foundation.

But vision without execution is just daydreaming.

Today, you EXECUTE. You translate big dreams into 90-day priorities. You commit to weekly accountability. You build the muscle of disciplined decision-making and problem-solving.

**Three hours invested today will drive 90 days of focused execution.**

This is the difference between MSPs that talk about growth and MSPs that achieve it.

You've got this.
