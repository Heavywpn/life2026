## Guidelines for Effective L10 Participation

### Meeting Culture
✅ **DO:**
- Be on time (or early)
- Come prepared with your updates
- Stay focused on the 90-day priorities (Rocks)
- View issues as opportunities, not blame
- Commit to to-dos you can actually complete
- Rate the meeting honestly
- Keep phones/distractions away
- Bring solutions-oriented mindset

❌ **DON'T:**
- Show up unprepared
- Let discussions go off-track
- Debate solutions before identifying root issue
- Commit to to-dos you can't deliver
- Make it personal - attack ideas, not people
- Sugarcoat your meeting rating
- Multitask during the meeting
- Bring solutions instead of issues

### IDS Process Mindset
The IDS (Identify, Discuss, Solve) portion is where we solve problems. Here's how:

**IDENTIFY:**
- State the issue clearly and objectively
- Use data when possible (from TruMethods)
- No blame, no solutions yet - just identify the problem

**DISCUSS:**
- Get to the root cause
- Ask "Why?" multiple times
- Surface all perspectives
- Use TruMethods data to inform discussion

**SOLVE:**
- Solve it once and for all (not band-aid solutions)
- Create specific to-dos with owners
- Decide and move on

### Time Management
- SEGUE: Keep good news to 1 minute each
- SCORECARD: Only discuss red/yellow metrics, don't explain green
- ROCKS: 30-second updates max, save issues for IDS
- HEADLINES: Headlines only, deep dives go to IDS
- TO-DOs: Just status, no discussion
- IDS: This gets the bulk of time, stay focused

---

## Pre-Meeting Self-Check

Ask yourself:
- [ ] Have I reviewed all my metrics in TruMethods?
- [ ] Do I know my Rock status and percentage?
- [ ] Have I completed my to-dos or can I explain why not?
- [ ] Have I identified issues worth discussing?
- [ ] Am I bringing data, not just opinions?
- [ ] Am I prepared to contribute to solving team issues?
- [ ] Do I have access to TruMethods during the meeting?

**Time commitment:** 10-15 minutes of Sunday evening prep = productive 90-minute meeting
