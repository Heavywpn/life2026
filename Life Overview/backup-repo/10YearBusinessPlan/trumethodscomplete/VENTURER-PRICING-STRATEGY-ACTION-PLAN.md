## OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

### "We found someone at $85/user"

> "That's monitoring and basic helpdesk - what most Brisbane providers offer at that price point. Ask them what vCIO services, strategic planning, and onsite visits cost as extras. You'll typically end up at $160-180/user. We include everything for $150, and you'll never have a surprise bill. For a charity, that budget predictability is essential for your board reporting."

### "That's expensive for a charity"

> "I understand budget constraints - that's exactly why we bundle everything at a predictable rate. At $150/user, you're at the Brisbane market average for comprehensive managed services. The $85 providers will charge you separately for every project, every strategic meeting, every onsite visit. Your board can budget $[X]/month with us and know exactly what you're getting. No surprises, no scope creep discussions."

### "Can you match $100/user?"

> "We could reduce our price, but we'd need to remove strategic planning, reduce your onsite allocation, and limit vCIO services. You'd be buying a commodity service, not a trusted advisor partnership. If that's what your organization needs, we're honestly not the right fit. We're built to be your strategic IT partner, not your lowest-cost vendor."

### "We're happy with our current provider"

> "I'm glad to hear that. What strategic planning do they provide? How often do they meet with you to discuss your technology roadmap and budget? Do they include onsite visits in your monthly fee? [Listen] Those services are included in our $150/user. We're not just monitoring your systems - we're actively aligning your technology with your organizational goals."

### "We need to think about it"

> "Of course. While you're considering, I'd encourage you to get a detailed breakdown from other providers you're evaluating. Ask specifically what's included in their base price versus what costs extra. Compare apples to apples. Most find that our comprehensive $150/user is actually more cost-effective than the $85-100 providers once you add the strategic services you need."
