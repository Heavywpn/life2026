# Business Idea: Core Computers Password Logbook for Elderly Customers

**Date Added:** 2025-11-08
**Status:** Idea / Research Phase
**Alignment:** P3 (Cyber Vulnerability Protection), P2 (Service-First Business Model)
**Timeframe:** Could launch Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar)

---

## Executive Summary

Create and sell a branded password logbook specifically for elderly customers in the local Brisbane area, leveraging Core Computers' existing trust and customer relationships. This isn't just selling a book - it's creating a service entry point for cybersecurity education, ongoing support, and recurring revenue.

**Key Insight from 2025 Trends:**
- UK National Cyber Security Center recommending offline/paper contingency plans
- 204 nationally significant cyber attacks in 2025 (up 129% from 2024)
- Government guidance: Organizations should maintain paper copies of security plans
- Physical password books gaining legitimacy as security measure for non-technical users

---

## Problem This Solves (Telos Alignment)

### P3: People & Businesses Vulnerable to Cyber Threats
**Current Reality:**
- Elderly customers write passwords on sticky notes (visible, insecure)
- Store passwords in "Passwords.txt" files (unencrypted, easy target)
- Use same password everywhere (one breach = total compromise)
- Constantly locked out (can't remember, endless password resets)
- Family can't help during emergencies (no access to accounts)

**Core Computers Can Protect Them:**
- Organized, secure physical storage
- Education on password hygiene
- Setup support and ongoing consultation
- Emergency protocols for family access
- Scam awareness training included

### P2: Service-First Business Model
**Differentiation from Competition:**
- Big box stores (Best Buy, Geek Squad): Can't provide personalized local service
- Amazon generic books: No setup help, no ongoing support, no trust
- Other MSPs: Don't serve elderly residential customers, focus on business only

**Core Computers Advantage:**
- Existing trust relationships with elderly customers
- Local presence and reputation
- Technical expertise to teach proper use
- Service-first approach (not just selling product)

## Marketing Strategy

### Trust-Building Approach (Critical for Elderly Market)

**Phase 1: Existing Customers (Warm Leads)**
- Email/letter campaign: "We noticed many customers struggle with passwords..."
- In-person mention during service calls (show samples)
- Special "founding customer" discount ($10 off)
- Testimonials from early adopters

**Phase 2: Community Credibility**
- **Library Workshop:** "Cybersecurity for Seniors: Protecting Your Online Accounts"
  - 45-minute presentation, Q&A, free checklist
  - Soft sell: Books available, special workshop discount
  - Library partnership = credibility

- **Local Media:** Press release angle: "Local IT Company Helps Seniors Combat 2025 Cyber Threats"
  - 204 attacks in 2025, elderly vulnerable, local solution
  - Position as "cybersecurity expert"
  - Community newspaper, radio, newsletter

- **Senior Centers:** Quarterly free "tech help" sessions
  - Build relationships with activity directors
  - Referral agreement: They recommend, you donate percentage

**Phase 3: Word-of-Mouth Amplification**
- **Referral Program:** Elderly customers talk to friends (church, bingo, senior groups)
- **Family Marketing:** Target adult children (40-60 year olds)
  - Facebook ads: "Give them security, give yourself peace of mind"
  - Holiday gift certificates for Mom/Dad

- **Professional Network:**
  - Estate attorneys (digital legacy planning)
  - Financial advisors (protect client accounts)
  - Home healthcare agencies (caregivers see password chaos)
  - Insurance agents (cybersecurity = risk management)

### Key Messaging
- "We're local - we're here when you need us"
- "No question is too simple"
- "Your parents/grandparents deserve to feel safe online"
- "Recommended by [local library/senior center]"
- "As seen in [Brisbane Times/local newspaper]"
- "Australian-tested fireproof protection"

---

## Success Metrics

**Year 1 Targets:**
- [ ] 150-300 books sold (average 12-25/month)
- [ ] 50+ Tier 2 or Tier 3 sales (higher margin)
- [ ] 5+ monthly support contracts established ($250-500/month recurring)
- [ ] 3+ library/senior center workshops conducted
- [ ] 1+ local media feature (newspaper, radio, TV)
- [ ] 20+ customer testimonials collected
- [ ] 40%+ service add-on conversion rate

**Strategic Success Indicators:**

- Customer lifetime value increases 20%+ for book purchasers

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: "Amazon is cheaper"
**Mitigation:**
- Not competing on price, selling trust + service
- Amazon: $8 book, zero support
- Core Computers: $20-50, includes setup, local support, peace of mind
- Target customers prioritize trust over saving $10

### Risk 2: "Customers don't want physical books"
**Mitigation:**
- Specific demographic (65+, non-technical) prefers physical
- If they refuse book, offer password manager setup service instead
- Either way, we're solving their problem (service revenue)

### Risk 3: Liability if book stolen
**Mitigation:**
- Clear warnings in book, liability disclaimer
- Educate on secure storage (fireproof bag, hidden location)
- Same liability as generic Amazon books
- Insurance review (business liability covers educational materials)

### Risk 4: Time investment vs. return
**Mitigation:**
- Most time in initial setup (design, printing, workshop creation)
- After launch, passive income (display in shop, mention during calls)
- Service add-ons = high-margin time (your hourly rate)
- Test with 10 customers before full commitment

## Connection to Telos Mission

### Problem P3: People Vulnerable to Cyber Threats
**Direct Impact:**
- Protecting elderly from credential theft, account takeovers, scams
- Teaching proper password hygiene (different passwords per site)
- Creating emergency access for family (crisis support)
- Scam awareness education (reference cards, consultations)

**Mission Execution:**
> "Use my skills (cybersecurity) to protect those who can't defend themselves."

This product literally hands them the tool + teaches them how to use it.

### Problem P2: Service-First vs. Greed
**Proof of Concept:**
- Could charge $100+ for Tier 3 (market would bear it)
- Pricing at $149.99 includes 2 hours consultation (fair value)
- Free workshops at libraries (community service, not extraction)
- Referral discounts (build community, not maximize per-transaction)

**Mission Execution:**
> "Charge based on value delivered, prove service-first is more profitable"

This demonstrates integrity-based pricing while building customer lifetime value.

### Strategic Business Value
- **Differentiation:** Big box stores can't replicate personal local service
- **Recurring Revenue:** Entry point to monthly support contracts
- **Community Positioning:** Local expert, media coverage, reputation
- **Customer Lifetime Value:** Deeper relationships = more referrals, more services

   - Sell to other IT companies in different regions
   - Package: Design files + implementation guide
   - Recurring revenue from licensing

4. **Corporate Gifting:**
   - Companies buy bulk for employee parents (holiday gifts)
   - B2B sales opportunity

5. **Product Line Expansion:**

3. **Opportunity Cost:** What are we NOT doing if we pursue this?
4. **Pilot Scope:** Can we test with existing customers before full launch?
5. **Exit Strategy:** If it doesn't work, what have we learned and how do we pivot?
