## Why Venturer Technology for Healthcare

Healthcare providers hold the most sensitive personal information that exists—health records. A breach doesn't just expose data; it exposes diagnoses, mental health history, medications, and personal medical decisions. Your patients trust you with their most private information.

Venturer Technology's **Fierce Protection Philosophy** means we approach patient data protection as a sacred responsibility. We provide the security infrastructure and compliance support that healthcare demands.

## Understanding Healthcare Technology Challenges

### Common Pain Points

| Challenge | Impact | How We Address It |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Patient data sensitivity | Breach = devastating reputational damage | Comprehensive security stack, 24/7 SOC |
| My Health Record compliance | Legal obligations, integration complexity | Secure configuration, access controls |
| RACGP standards (GP practices) | Accreditation requirements | Compliance support, documentation |
| Medical device integration | Legacy systems, security gaps | Vendor coordination, network segmentation |
| Multi-location practices | Consistent security across sites | Centralised management, MDM |
| Staff turnover | Access control challenges | Streamlined onboarding/offboarding |
| After-hours access | Doctors accessing records remotely | Secure remote access, conditional access |
| Practice management systems | Integration with Medicare, pathology, imaging | Vendor liaison, holistic support |

### Healthcare Regulatory Landscape

#### Privacy Act 1988 & Australian Privacy Principles

**Health service providers are covered regardless of size** (no $3M threshold exemption).

- APP 11 requires reasonable security measures
- APP 6 restricts use and disclosure of health information
- Health information is "sensitive information" requiring extra protection

#### My Health Record Act 2012

**Registered healthcare providers must:**
- Have appropriate security arrangements
- Ensure only authorised staff access records
- Maintain audit logs of access
- Report security breaches
- Comply with My Health Record system operator requirements

#### Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) Scheme

**Healthcare providers must:**
- Assess suspected breaches within 30 days
- Notify OAIC and affected individuals of eligible breaches
- Have breach response procedures in place
- Maintain breach register

*Health information breaches are almost always "eligible" due to likely serious harm.*

#### RACGP Standards (General Practices)

**5th Edition Standards for General Practices** require:

| Standard Area | Key Requirements |
|--------------|------------------|
| Practice information systems | Secure clinical software, access controls |
| Information security | Backup, disaster recovery, breach response |
| Privacy | Compliance with Privacy Act, staff training |
| Staff training | Security awareness, privacy obligations |
| Business continuity | Documented plans, tested recovery |

#### AHPRA & National Law

**Health practitioners must:**
- Protect patient confidentiality
- Maintain adequate records
- Operate within scope of registration

*Technology failures can create professional conduct issues.*

---

## Recommended Tier: Professional (Minimum)

**All healthcare providers require Professional tier minimum** because:

| Healthcare Reality | Why Professional Required |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Health information = sensitive information | Full security stack mandatory |
| Privacy Act applies regardless of size | 24/7 SOC, encryption, access controls |
| My Health Record obligations | Audit logging, access management |
| RACGP accreditation (GPs) | Compliance documentation, security measures |
| Breach notification obligations | Incident response capability |
| Patient trust is paramount | Security awareness training for all staff |
| Clinical systems are mission-critical | SLA response times, business continuity |

### When Premium Tier Is Needed

**Premium ($175-220/user)** for healthcare organisations with:
- 50+ staff
- Hospital or large medical centre
- Multiple locations/practices
- Pathology or radiology with significant data volumes
- Aged care facilities with SIRS reporting
- 24/7 operations (hospitals, emergency services)
- Complex integrations (multiple clinical systems)
- Board governance requirements

## Onboarding Considerations: Healthcare

### Common Onboarding Discoveries

| Finding | Typical Response |
|---------|------------------|
| Shared clinical system logins | Individual accounts, proper licensing |
| No access logging enabled | Enable audit trails, may need vendor |
| Weak MHR security configuration | Configuration remediation |
| Medical devices on main network | Network segmentation project |
| No staff security training | Training platform deployment |
| Paper-based incident procedures | Documentation and digitisation |

### Healthcare Onboarding Package

| Tier | Typical Onboarding | Includes |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| Professional | $3,000-6,000 | Full assessment, security baseline, clinical system review, MHR configuration check |
| Premium | $12,000-25,000 | Comprehensive discovery, medical device assessment, multi-site coordination |

*Healthcare onboarding requires clinical system vendor coordination. Budget additional time.*

---

## Breach Response: Healthcare Specifics

Healthcare breaches have special considerations:

### Notification Obligations

| Requirement | Timeframe | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Assess whether breach is "eligible" | 30 days max | Health breaches almost always eligible |
| Notify OAIC | As soon as practicable | Health breaches are high priority |
| Notify affected individuals | As soon as practicable | Consider impact on vulnerable patients |
| My Health Record breach | Immediately | Separate notification to System Operator |
| RACGP incident reporting | Per accreditation | Document in QI register |

### Venturer Breach Support

## Quick Reference: Healthcare Tier Selection

```
Is the organisation 50+ staff OR hospital/large facility?
  └─ YES → PREMIUM ($175-220/user, typically $195-210)
  └─ NO ↓

Is the organisation a healthcare provider handling patient information?
  └─ YES → PROFESSIONAL ($130+$15-20/user = $145-150/user minimum)
  └─ NO → Not healthcare (refer to other vertical)
```

**Essential tier is NEVER appropriate for healthcare clients.**

---

## Risk Warning: Underselling Healthcare

**Do not quote Essential tier to healthcare clients.**

Even a solo practitioner with 1 staff member requires Professional tier because:
- Privacy Act applies to ALL health service providers regardless of size
- My Health Record obligations require security measures
- Health information is "sensitive information" under the Privacy Act
- Breaches cause serious harm to patients (identity theft, discrimination)
- Accreditation and registration depend on appropriate data protection

**Minimum engagement for any healthcare client: Professional tier at $520/month minimum.**
