## Onboarding Considerations: Financial Services

| No security awareness training | Platform deployment, baseline assessment |
| Outdated integration security | Vendor security review, configuration hardening |

### Financial Services Onboarding Package

| Tier | Typical Onboarding | Includes |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| Professional | $3,000-7,500 | Full assessment, security baseline, compliance gap analysis, platform review |

## Quick Reference: Financial Services Tier Selection

```
Is the organisation 50+ staff OR APRA-regulated (CPS 234)?
  └─ YES → PREMIUM ($175-220/user, typically $195-220)
  └─ NO ↓

Is the organisation in financial services (AFSL, ACL, TPB, AML)?
  └─ YES → PROFESSIONAL ($130+$15-25/user = $145-155/user minimum)
  └─ NO → Not financial services (refer to other vertical)
```

**Essential tier is NEVER appropriate for financial services clients.**

---

## Risk Warning: Underselling Financial Services

**Do not quote Essential tier to financial services clients.**

Even a solo financial advisor with 1 staff member requires Professional tier because:
- Regulatory expectations mandate appropriate cyber security
- Client data sensitivity requires comprehensive protection
- Cyber insurance requirements demand evidence of controls
- Reputational risk from breach is career-ending
- License conditions require technological adequacy

**Minimum engagement for any financial services client: Professional tier at $520/month minimum.**
