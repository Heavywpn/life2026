# Venturer Technology Service Edges

## What Are Edges?

Edges define the clear boundaries of what's included and excluded in our managed services. Clear edges:
- Set accurate client expectations
- Prevent scope creep
- Protect our margins
- Ensure consistent service delivery
- Make billing transparent

## The Three Questions

For every service area, we answer:

1. **What IS included?**
2. **What is NOT included?**
3. **What's the END RESULT for the client's business?**

### After-Hours Emergencies

**What qualifies as emergency:**
- Complete business stoppage affecting all users
- Critical security incident (active breach)
- Complete system failure (email, core apps)

**What does NOT qualify:**
- Individual user issues
- "Urgent" but not critical requests
- Issues that can wait until business hours
- Convenience requests

### User Training

**INCLUDED:**
- Basic "how do I..." questions (Professional/Premium for M365)

## Edge Communication Guidelines

### Setting Expectations

**During sales:**
- Walk through the Service Schedule
- Highlight key inclusions AND exclusions
- Discuss common scenarios
- No surprises after signing

**During onboarding:**
- Review edges again with primary contact
- Document specific agreements in client record
- Clarify any gray areas

**Ongoing:**
- When scope questions arise, refer to Service Schedule
- Be consistent in applying edges
- Communicate before work begins if it's billable

### When Something Falls Outside Edges

**Our approach:**
1. Acknowledge the request
2. Explain if/why it's outside scope
3. Offer options: billable work, project scope, upgrade tier
4. Document the decision
5. Follow through professionally

**Example script:**
> "That's a great request. It falls outside your current service tier because [reason]. We can absolutely help with this—I can quote it as a project, or if this is a regular need, we could discuss upgrading to Professional tier where it's included. What would work best for you?"
