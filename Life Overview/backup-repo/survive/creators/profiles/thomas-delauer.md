  - Fasted training (military often operates without ideal nutrition timing)
  - Mental toughness from dietary discipline
  - Reduced dependency on constant resupply
- **Moderate alignment**:
  - Performance optimization focus
  - Practical protocols for busy schedules
- **New/different**:
  - Deep dive into metabolic mechanisms
  - Keto-adaptation research
  - Fat oxidation as primary fuel
- **Conflicts**:
  - Military typically carb-loads for operations
  - Traditional sports nutrition contradicts some findings
