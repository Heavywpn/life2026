#### Recipe Details: Garlic Chilli Noodles
**Ingredients:**
- 2 tbsp Chilli flakes
- 2 tbsp Soy sauce
- 1 tbsp mirin or Chinese cooking wine (optional)
- 1 tbsp vinegar
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 5 cloves of garlic (finely diced)
- 4 spring onions (diced)
- 300g pork mince (fattier the better)
- 200g udon noodles
- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- Sesame seeds
- Optional: Chilli Crunch garnish

**Directions:**
1. In a cup, combine chilli flakes, soy sauce, mirin, vinegar, and sugar → stir well to create spicy sauce
2. Add pot of water to heat for noodles (start next step when boiling)
3. Fry garlic and whites of spring onion in 1 tbsp cooking oil for 2-3 minutes on high heat until fragrant
4. Add pork mince and fry 7-8 minutes, stirring every 1-2 minutes until it browns (watch for burnt sugar smell)
5. While mince cooks: Cook udon noodles per packet instructions (usually 3 minutes), then drain
6. Once mince is cooked: Add udon noodles and mix with sesame oil
7. Garnish with green parts of spring onion, sesame seeds, and chilli crunch

**Project Relevance:**
- Quick cooking (15 min total) → time efficiency for busy prep scenarios
- Simple ingredients → most are shelf-stable (soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, noodles, sesame oil)
- High calorie/protein → suitable for physically demanding days
- Scalable recipe (serves 4) → batch cooking potential
- Budget-conscious → affordable ingredients

**Preparedness Assessment:**
- **Shelf-Stable Ingredients**: ✅ Most ingredients (dried noodles, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, sesame oil, chili flakes)
- **Fresh Ingredients**: ⚠️ Garlic, spring onions, pork mince (could substitute with canned/dried alternatives)
- **Equipment Needed**: Stove/burner, pot, pan, basic utensils
- **Skill Level**: Beginner (basic frying and boiling)
- **Calories**: High (pork mince + noodles + oil = substantial energy)
- **Storage**: Noodles last months/years, sauces last months, fresh ingredients need rotation

**Field Test Ideas:**
- [ ] Make with fresh ingredients as written
- [ ] Test with shelf-stable substitutes (dried garlic, dehydrated green onions, canned pork)
- [ ] Try with alternative proteins (canned chicken, spam, dried meat)
- [ ] Test cooking on camp stove or outdoor burner
- [ ] Experiment with bulk batch cooking and storage
