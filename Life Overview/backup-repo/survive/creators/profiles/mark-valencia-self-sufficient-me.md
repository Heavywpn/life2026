### The Self-Sufficiency Philosophy
**Core Approach**: Living on a small 3-acre property, growing food to supplement grocery bills, focusing on practical self-sufficiency (not off-grid extremism)

**Key Principles**:
- **Supplement, don't replace**: Grow food to reduce grocery costs, not achieve 100% self-sufficiency
- **Mental health through gardening**: Gardening as therapy for PTSD and mental well-being
- **Family-centered**: Self-sufficiency decisions based on family needs, not ideology
- **Practical over perfect**: Real-world advice from actual experience (successes AND failures)
- **Accessible to all**: Focus on what average person can do, not just homesteading experts

### Property Details
- **Location**: Australia (specific region not disclosed for privacy)
- **Size**: 3 acres
- **Uses**: Vegetable gardens, fruit orchard, chickens, composting, permaculture design
- **Goal**: Produce enough food to significantly reduce grocery bills and provide fresh, healthy produce

## Credibility Assessment

- **Family stability**: Raised two well-balanced boys, maintained strong marriage through unconventional choices
- **Relatable**: Not preachy, shares failures as well as successes, approachable teaching style

### Perspective/Approach
- **Australian perspective**: Climate, seasons, pests, plants differ from Northern Hemisphere (but principles apply universally)

- **Practical self-sufficiency**: Supplement groceries, not total off-grid isolation
- **Mental health emphasis**: Gardening for well-being, not just food production
