### The Creation of Jack Reacher
**Origin Story**: When laid off from Granada Television in 1995, Child was 40, jobless, broke, with a family to feed. Rather than seek a new job, he sat down to write a novel in longhand. The book (Killing Floor) was an instant hit, selling strongly worldwide.

**The Name "Reacher"**: While grocery shopping with his wife Jane at a supermarket in Kendal, Cumbria, people would ask the tall Grant to reach items from high shelves. Jane joked: "Hey, if this writing thing doesn't pan out, you could always be a reacher in a supermarket." Child thought: "Reacher – good name."

**Transition to Andrew Child**: In January 2020, Lee Child announced he would retire from writing the Jack Reacher series and hand it to his brother Andrew Grant (who writes as Andrew Child). Lee intended to write the next few books with Andrew before passing the series entirely to him. The first co-authored book was The Sentinel (2020).
