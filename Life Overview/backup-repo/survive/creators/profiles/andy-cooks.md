## Cross-Reference with Experience

### Alignment with Military Training
- **High alignment**: None (not military/tactical content)
- **Moderate alignment**:
  - Efficiency focus (simple, repeatable systems)
  - Resource optimization (90% of meals = one framework)
  - Temperature precision (understanding food safety margins)
- **New/different**:
  - Home cooking techniques
  - Gas grill operation
  - Marinade chemistry
  - Vegetable texture optimization
- **Conflicts**:
  - Not survival-focused
  - Requires modern equipment
  - Fresh ingredient dependency

### Value-Add Beyond Existing Knowledge
- **Simple marinade frameworks**: Two-ingredient bases adaptable to different proteins
- **Texture focus**: Why people reject vegetables (mushiness) and how to prevent
- **Australian BBQ culture**: Gas grill techniques (different from US charcoal culture)
- **Temperature honesty**: Personal vs official recommendations (rare transparency)
- **Repeatability**: 90% of meals = variations on one framework (efficiency)
- **Home butchery economics**: 50% cost savings buying subprimals vs pre-cut steaks
- **Cuisson control**: Proper steak thickness (2+ fingers) for both crust and doneness
- **Zero-waste butchery**: Four-category system (steaks/fat/trim/waste) - everything has use
- **Seam butchery fundamentals**: Work with anatomy, not against it
- **Beginner-friendly progression**: Rump → Sirloin/Ribeye → Fillet → Short Loin
- **Multiple products from one purchase**: Rump yields picanha, steaks, roast beef, stir fry
- **Tallow rendering**: Best cooking fat for steaks, save all fat trimmings
- **Grain direction mastery**: Critical for tenderness across all cuts

## Personal Notes & Observations

### Initial Impressions
- Genuine, down-to-earth personality
- Strong emphasis on what he actually cooks (not aspirational content)
- Excellent community engagement (reads every comment, adjusts based on feedback)
- Self-aware humor and transparency
- Practical over perfectionist
- Kiwi pride evident (All Blacks video, rugby references)

### Evolution of Opinion
- Only one video analyzed so far
- Initial impression: More valuable for home cooking baseline than survival applications
- Techniques are adaptable but require conversion

### Standout Moments
- **Temperature transparency**: "I pull at 62°C but I'm telling you to pull at 70°C" - rare honesty
- **Texture insight**: "Texture is why people don't like vegetables" - addresses root cause
- **Simplicity admission**: "90% of summer meals = this style" - genuine lifestyle cooking
- **Schedule change**: Moved posting back to Sundays based on overwhelming viewer consensus
- **Community love**: Viewers specifically request Caitlyn in videos ("cherry on top")
- **Marbling reality check**: "We've been spoiled on social media... this is the steak I grew up eating and there's nothing wrong with it"
- **Cuisson problem**: "Supermarket steaks too thin - really hard to get both good crust and not overcook inside"
- **Best starter cut**: "Rump is fantastic place to start home butchery - good value proposition for families"
- **Cost savings**: "Half the price than you'd pay for 4-5 steaks in supermarket or butcher"
- **Honest mistakes**: "I aimed for 1kg, got 1.6kg" - shows real-time errors

### Red Flags/Concerns
- Temperature recommendations below official guidelines (62°C chicken) - could be food safety issue
- Equipment-dependent (may not translate to limited resource scenarios)
- Not survival/preparedness focused (requires significant adaptation)
- Fresh ingredient focus (shelf-stable versions not demonstrated)
