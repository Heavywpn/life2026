## Core Philosophy

### "Optimize Your Biology"

**Central Premise:** Most people are operating at fraction of their potential due to:
1. Genetic methylation issues (50-60% of population has MTHFR variants)
2. Unidentified nutritional deficiencies
3. Poor sleep quality
4. Lack of hormetic stressors (cold, heat, exercise)
5. Chronic inflammation

**Solution Approach:**
1. **Test** - Get baseline biomarkers (blood work, genetic testing)
2. **Identify** - Find deficiencies and genetic variants
3. **Supplement** - Address deficiencies with targeted nutrients
4. **Optimize** - Add hormetic stressors (cold, red light, etc.)
5. **Measure** - Re-test to verify improvements

### Key Principles

**1. "You Can't Manage What You Don't Measure"**
- Must test to know what's wrong
- Guessing at supplementation is wasteful
- Track biomarkers over time
- Quantify improvements

**2. "Most People Are Walking Around Deficient"**
- B12 deficiency extremely common
- Folate issues due to MTHFR gene
- Vitamin D deficiency pandemic
- Magnesium deficiency widespread
- These deficiencies cause most "unexplained" symptoms

**3. "Your Genetics Load the Gun, Environment Pulls the Trigger"**
- Having gene variant doesn't doom you
- Environment and lifestyle determine outcomes
- Can work around genetic disadvantages
- Epigenetics: genes can be turned on/off

**4. "Discomfort Makes You Stronger"**
- Cold exposure as hormetic stress
- Brief, intense stressors improve resilience
- Avoiding all discomfort weakens you
- "If your morning is hard, your day will be easy"

**5. "Oxygen is the Currency of Life"**
- Nasal breathing emphasis
- Proper oxygenation critical
- Mouth breathing causes problems
- Breathing technique affects everything

## Teaching Approach

### Communication Style
- **Accessible Science:** Makes complex biology understandable
- **Storytelling:** Uses personal stories and client transformations
- **Data-Driven:** Always references studies, biomarkers, measurable results
- **Confidence:** Very confident in his methodologies (sometimes controversial)

**2. Cold Plunging Benefits**
- Mental clarity ("drug of choice")
- Dopamine release (lasts hours after)
