## Personal Notes & Observations

### Initial Impressions

Refreshingly honest content creator who openly admits when his own methods didn't work best (homemade compost scored lowest in test). The willingness to travel to interview a commercial compost expert and then recommend buying compost shows pragmatic self-sufficiency rather than dogmatic "do everything yourself" ideology.

The carrot experiment demonstrates scientific thinking - controlled variables, measured results, honest reporting. The admission that "life got the better of me" and he couldn't make enough compost resonates as real-world homesteading experience.

Kane's interview provides exceptional insight into commercial composting science - fermentation stages, nitrogen stabilization, pile height dynamics, oxygen management. This level of technical detail is rare in homesteading content.

### Evolution of Opinion
N/A - Only one video analyzed so far

### Standout Moments

1. **Honest failure acknowledgment**: His own compost scored worst (1,370g vs. winner's 2,721g)
2. **Pragmatic philosophy**: "It's totally fine if you have to outsource your soil because there is some people that actually do it for a living and do it really well"
3. **Community organism concept**: "If we all support each other then we're creating that macro community organism"
4. **Compost turning revelation**: Turning every 2 days may be worse than every 2-3 days (disrupts biology)
5. **International training**: Traveled to 2,000m elevation in southern India to learn biodynamic composting
6. **Scale acknowledgment**: "I'd have to turn a cubic meter of compost every day" to supply 4 cubic meters annually
7. **Soil biology preservation**: Aerate with fork lift, don't turn, keep ecosystem intact

### Red Flags/Concerns

- **Rat damage disclaimer**: His compost test was compromised by rats, but still counted in results (should ideally retest)
- **Sample size**: Only one experiment shown (need to see more before fully trusting methodology)
- **Australian bias**: Climate, products, and methods may not transfer to other regions
- **Commercial promotion**: Heavily features Red Soil Organics (possible commercial relationship?)
- **Scale assumptions**: 4 cubic meter requirement may not help smaller gardeners
- **India training details**: Vague about specific techniques learned, mostly mentions location
- **No fertilizer control**: Carrot test had no fertilized control group for comparison

### Questions to Research

- [ ] What specific biodynamic techniques were learned in India?
- [ ] What is Veno Budaji Butom facility in India?
- [ ] Is there a commercial relationship with Red Soil Organics?
- [ ] How long has Weedy been homesteading/gardening?
- [ ] What size is the property?
- [ ] What other permaculture training/credentials?
- [ ] How does Australian climate affect techniques?
- [ ] What results from other experiments/seasons?
- [ ] Details on food forest development?
- [ ] Straw bale cottage construction process?
