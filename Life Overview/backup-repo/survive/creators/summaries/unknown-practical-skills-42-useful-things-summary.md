- Helping them correct, not scolding

  3. Something they might have in common

**41. Receive compliments**
- **Common response**: Downplay or make joke (feel uncomfortable)
- **Realization**: That's actually rude
- **What happens**: Force them to "glaze you harder" (opposite of what you want)
- **Better response**: "Thanks man, that really means a lot" - then move on
- **Bad example**: Extended tennis compliment rejection spiral
