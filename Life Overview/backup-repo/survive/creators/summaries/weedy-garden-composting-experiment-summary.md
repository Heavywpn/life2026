## Experiment Overview

### Problem Statement
Weedy's large garden requires 4 cubic meters of compost annually. To produce this much with the popular 18-28 day hot compost method (turning every 2 days), he would need to turn a cubic meter of compost every single day. This proved unrealistic given other homestead responsibilities (filming, building, planting, fixing).

### Research Question
Which compost type produces the best vegetable yields: homemade, worm castings, commercial nursery soil, or specialty commercial compost?

### Solution Approach
1. Source commercial compost from expert (Kane at Red Soil Organics, Sunshine Coast)
2. Run controlled carrot growing experiment
3. Interview commercial compost maker to understand science
4. Measure results objectively

---

## The Carrot Growing Experiment

### Methodology
- **Duration**: Several months (spring harvest)
- **Test subjects**: Carrots (same seed batch, measured quantity)
- **Growing medium**: 50% river sand + 50% compost (4 variations)
- **Pots**: 4 identical large pots
- **Variables controlled**: Water (same amount), no fertilizer, same sunlight
- **Measurement**: Harvest weight in grams

### Four Compost Types Tested

1. **Weedy's Homemade Compost**
   - Biodynamic methods learned in southern India (Veno Budaji Butom, 2,000m elevation)
   - Diverse inputs from property (banana skins, various materials)
   - Closed-loop system (materials from same land)
   - "Midground kind of placid compost" per Kane

2. **Worm Castings**
   - From "Wormville" bathtub worm farm
   - Vermicompost production system

3. **Store-Bought Nursery Soil**
   - Commercial garden soil from local nursery
   - Ready-to-use, unnamed brand

4. **Red Soil Organics "Morpheus" Blend**
   - Specialty commercial compost
   - Fertilizer-grade, high-nitrogen
   - Manure-based with specific ingredients

- "Fertilizer-grade" compost

**Second: Worm Castings**
- 1,717g total yield
- Lots of small carrots
- Few large carrots
- Consistent production but limited size

**Third: Store-Bought Nursery Soil**
- 1,640g total yield
- Some rotten carrots during growth
- Very hairy root systems
- Inconsistent quality

**Fourth: Homemade Compost (Compromised)**
- 1,370g total yield
- **IMPORTANT**: Many carrots eaten by rats during growth
- Test results invalid due to predation
- True performance unknown

### Taste Test Results
**Conclusion**: No discernible difference in taste between any of the four compost types. All carrots tasted equally "carroty."

## Key Insights from Kane (Red Soil Organics)

### Why Commercial Compost Won

1. **Higher nitrogen concentration**
   - Manure-based (best organic nitrogen source)
   - Stabilized through fermentation
   - Bound to humus for slow release
   - Strong ammonia smell indicates active nitrogen

2. **Advanced fermentation process**
   - Multiple stages: primary ferment → wind rows → fungal curing
   - Higher piles possible with machinery (changes ecosystem)
   - Lactobacillus fermentation at different stages
   - Oxygen management through rolling/forking
   - Weekly inoculation with microbes

3. **Nitrogen preservation**
   - Captured quickly after leaving animal
   - Prevents nitrogen/carbon loss during stabilization
   - Fermentation stabilizes nutrients before they burn off

4. **Optimized carbon-to-nitrogen ratio**
   - Sticky humus indicates proper binding
   - Carbon holds nitrogen for plant availability
   - "Fertilizer value" from stabilized compounds

### The Morpheus Blend Ingredients

- Cow and pig manure
- Jigle manure (type of animal manure)
- Rose grass chaff (grown on-site)
- 50mm hardwood mulch
- Locally milled hardwood sawdust
- Locally milled arborist chip

**Philosophy**: Developed specifically so anyone (suburbia to farmlands, any soil type) can grow their own food. Named after Matrix reference - "red pill" of self-sufficiency.

## Composting Science Revelations

### Myth: Turn Compost Every 2 Days

**Popular Method**: 18-28 day "hot compost" with daily or every-other-day turning

**Kane's Correction**:
- Turning every 2-3 days is BETTER than more frequent turning
- Biology needs time to stabilize between disturbances
- Oxygen doesn't deplete as fast as commonly thought
- With 50% woody matter, may only need turning every 4-5 days
- Each turn resets the ecosystem, requiring recalibration time

### Home Compost vs. Commercial

**Home Compost Advantages**:
- Diverse inputs from your specific land
- Closed-loop system (land recognizes its own materials)
- "Condensing of energy is recognized by the land"
- Good relationship between soil and plants
- Free/low-cost

**Home Compost Limitations**:
- Slower process (less nitrogen)
- Lower piles (different microbial ecosystem)
- Manual labor intensive
- Difficult to scale for large gardens
- Can't match commercial nitrogen levels

**Commercial Compost Advantages**:
- Machinery enables higher piles (temperature/ecosystem control)
- Multiple fermentation stages
- Optimized nitrogen capture and stabilization
- Consistent quality and concentration
- Saves time for other homestead work

## Community Food Systems Philosophy

### The "Macro Community Organism" Concept

**Weedy's Realization**:
> "It's totally fine if you have to outsource your soil because there is some people that actually do it for a living and do it really well. And so you're supporting them, you're supporting your garden, and you're able to take it a little bit easier with your own compost turning."

**Kane's Addition**:
> "At the end of the day that's also part of the system. It's like you don't have to do everything yourself. There are members in the community that also are doing things and if we all support each other then we're creating that macro community organism."

### Implications for Self-Sufficiency

1. **Community resilience** > Individual self-reliance
2. **Specialization** allows higher quality outcomes
3. **Time savings** enable focus on other skills
4. **Economic support** for local regenerative agriculture
5. **Realistic expectations** prevent burnout and failure

## Practical Application Methods

### How to Apply Commercial Compost (Per Kane)

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Apply thick layer and plant directly into it
- ❌ Use fresh compost without integration
- ❌ Turn/disturb soil ecosystem

**DO**:
- ✅ Apply 5cm (2 inch) layer on top
- ✅ Gently scratch/rake into surface
- ✅ Water well before application
- ✅ Aerate soil with fork (lift, don't turn)
- ✅ Add thin sugarcane mulch layer on top
- ✅ Water again after seedling planting

**Why**: Planting directly into concentrated compost causes "shock" or "implosion" in seedlings. Need to integrate with existing soil.

### Soil Aeration Technique

1. Pull back old mulch
2. **Lift** soil with garden fork (don't turn)
3. Keep ecosystem intact (no inversion)
4. Soak with water
5. Apply 5cm compost layer
6. Gently scratch into surface
7. Apply thin mulch layer
8. Water and plant seedlings

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Homemade Composting Reality Check

**Annual requirement for Weedy's garden**: 4 cubic meters

**To produce via 18-28 day hot compost**:
- Turn 1 cubic meter every single day
- Or turn smaller pile every 2 days, 365 days/year
- Time commitment: ~30 minutes to 1 hour daily
- Physical labor: Significant (pile lifting/turning)
- Input sourcing: Constant need for materials

**Weedy's assessment**: "Not really doable" with other homestead responsibilities

### When to Make vs. Buy

**Make your own compost when**:
- Small garden with manageable needs
- Waste reduction is primary goal
- Time and energy available
- Enjoy the process
- Want closed-loop system

**Buy commercial compost when**:
- Large garden (multiple cubic meters needed)
- Time-constrained with other projects
- Want higher nitrogen/fertilizer value
- Quality local producer available
- Comparative cost makes sense

## Questions Raised by Experiment

### Methodological Concerns

1. **Rat damage invalidates homemade compost test**
   - Need to re-run without predation
   - True performance of homemade compost unknown
   - Could have performed better than results show

2. **No fertilized control group**
   - What would chemically fertilized carrots have yielded?
   - Is 2,721g exceptional or average?
   - Baseline needed for context

3. **Single experiment**
   - Need repeated trials for statistical significance
   - Different vegetables for comparison
   - Different seasons/conditions

4. **Taste test limitations**
   - Only subjective taste comparison
   - No nutritional analysis
   - Nutrient density could differ despite similar taste

### Research Opportunities

- [ ] Re-run experiment with rat protection
- [ ] Add chemical fertilizer control group
- [ ] Test with multiple vegetable types
- [ ] Nutritional analysis of harvests
- [ ] Cost-per-kilogram comparison
- [ ] Repeat over multiple seasons
- [ ] Test smaller quantities of compost types

## Practical Takeaways

### For Small Gardens
- Home composting is feasible and valuable
- Worm casting production in bathtub viable
- Turn less frequently than popular methods suggest (every 2-3 days vs. daily)
- Mix 50% sand for root vegetables

### For Large Gardens
- 4+ cubic meter annual requirement likely needs commercial supplementation
- Support local quality compost producers
- Part of community food systems, not failure of self-sufficiency
- Focus energy on other homestead skills

### For All Gardeners
1. **Don't plant directly in fresh compost** (causes shock)
2. **Aerate soil, don't turn it** (preserves biology)
3. **Apply 5cm layer and scratch in** (integration method)
4. **Quality compost has ammonia smell** (nitrogen indicator)
5. **Sticky humus is the goal** (carbon-nitrogen binding)
6. **Taste ≠ yield** (nutrition may differ even with same taste)
