# Modified Low-Carb Diet for Strength Preservation and Fat Loss

**Created**: 2025-11-16
**Updated**: 2025-11-16 (Added Immune Juice Protocol)
**Based On**: Dr. Andrew Koutnik research + Bryan Johnson protocols + Proven Immune Protocol
**Baseline**: 2300 cal/day maintenance (Whoop data)
**Goal**: Slow fat loss over 3 months while maintaining strength, cognitive function, and immune health
**For**: Ricky

---

## Overview

This protocol is designed for sustainable fat loss (7-10 lbs over 3 months) while:
- Preserving muscle mass and strength
- Maintaining cognitive function (no brain fog after adaptation)
- Building metabolic flexibility (fat adaptation)
- Creating dietary resilience (reduced carb dependency)
- **Supporting immune system** (fresh juice protocol - no cold/flu in years)

**Research Foundation**: Dr. Koutnik's studies show athletes maintain performance on ketogenic diets with fat oxidation rates of 1.5-1.85g/min at 85%+ VO2 max - previously thought impossible.

**Note**: This is "Modified Low-Carb" (40-50g carbs) rather than strict keto (<30g) to accommodate the proven immune juice protocol. Prioritizing long-term health and immune function over strict ketosis.

---

## Target Calories: 1900-2000/day

**Caloric Deficit**: 300-400 cal/day
**Expected Fat Loss**: ~0.6-0.8 lbs/week
**3-Month Total**: 7-10 lbs actual fat loss

**Why This Deficit**:
- Aggressive enough to see results
- Conservative enough to preserve muscle
- Sustainable long-term
- Doesn't crash metabolism or hormones

---

## Macronutrient Breakdown

| Macro | Daily Amount | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Protein** | 180-200g | Muscle preservation (HIGH priority) |
| **Fat** | 130-140g | Ketone production, brain fuel, satiety |
| **Net Carbs** | 40-50g | Modified low-carb (includes ~18g from immune juice) |

**Carb Allocation**:
- ~18g from immune juice (non-negotiable for immune health)
- ~22-32g from vegetables and other sources

**Ratio**: ~40% fat, ~45% protein, ~15% carbs by calories

**Note**: This is higher protein than "standard" keto (which is 70-75% fat) and higher carbs than strict keto (<30g). Research supports higher protein for strength preservation during fat loss. The slightly higher carbs accommodate the proven immune protocol while maintaining most fat-adaptation benefits.

---

## IMMUNE JUICE PROTOCOL (Non-Negotiable)

**Proven Track Record**: No cold or flu for several years since starting daily fresh juice

### Why This Matters More Than Strict Ketosis

1. **Immune function > strict ketosis** - Being sick loses more muscle than slightly higher carbs
2. **Ginger benefits proven** - Anti-inflammatory, immune-boosting, circulation
3. **Consistency over years** - Established habit that works
4. **Mental health** - Don't remove something that's working

### Daily Juice Protocol

**Serving Size**: 150-200ml per person
**Timing**: Afternoon (avoids morning crash, pre-workout energy)

**Option A - Orange-Ginger (Higher Vitamin C)**
- 2-3 oranges juiced
- carrot
- HEAVY ginger (1+ inch fresh root)
- Makes ~200ml per person
- **Carbs**: ~16-20g per serving
- **Benefits**: Vitamin C, ginger's immune compounds, natural energy

**Option B - Beetroot-Ginger (Nitric Oxide + Immune)**
- 1-2 beetroots juiced
- green apple
- mint
- HEAVY ginger (1+ inch fresh root)
- Optional: carrot or apple for taste
- Makes ~200ml per person
- **Carbs**: ~15-18g per serving
- **Benefits**: Nitric oxide (workout performance), ginger immune boost, blood pressure support

### Why Afternoon Timing Works

- **Pre-workout**: Natural sugars provide quick energy
- **Avoid morning crash**: Doesn't spike insulin at start of day
- **Mental performance**: Morning focus maintained on fat/protein
- **Workout boost**: Beetroot's nitric oxide benefits kick in for training

### Impact on Carb Budget

**Daily Carb Breakdown**:
- Immune juice: ~18g (fixed, non-negotiable)
- Remaining for food: 22-32g
- Focus remaining carbs on: green vegetables (nutrient density)

**This is acceptable because**:
- Still far below standard diet (200-300g carbs)
- Will maintain most fat-adaptation benefits
- Immune health is primary health pillar
- Prevents illness-induced muscle loss
- Mental health: don't remove working protocols

## CRITICAL: Electrolyte Protocol

**THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE** - Most keto failures are electrolyte deficiency, not the diet itself.

### Why Electrolytes Matter
- Keto causes water/sodium excretion
- Low insulin = kidneys dump sodium
- Brain fog, cramps, fatigue are ALL electrolyte issues
- Bryan Johnson's sauna protocol: cramps solved with 50% more electrolytes

### Daily Electrolyte Targets

| Electrolyte | Daily Amount | Sources |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Sodium** | 5000-7000mg | Salt everything, bone broth, LMNT/Element |
| **Magnesium** | 400-500mg | Supplement (glycinate form), spinach, avocado |
| **Potassium** | 3000-4000mg | Avocado, spinach, mushrooms, Lite Salt |

### Practical Implementation

**Morning Routine**:
- 16oz water with 1/4 tsp salt + 1/4 tsp Lite Salt
- OR 1 packet LMNT/Element electrolytes

**Pre-Workout**:
- Salt/electrolytes 30 min before training
- 16oz water minimum

**Throughout Day**:
- Salt ALL food liberally
- Don't fear salt (you're excreting more now)
- 1-2 cups bone broth (homemade or quality store-bought)

**Before Bed**:
- 400mg magnesium glycinate (helps sleep, prevents cramps)

### Signs of Electrolyte Deficiency
- Brain fog, difficulty concentrating
- Headaches
- Muscle cramps (especially calves, hamstrings)
- Fatigue despite adequate sleep
- Heart palpitations
- Dizziness when standing

**Solution**: MORE SALT. Seriously. You need way more than you think.

---

## Strength Training Protocol

### Pre-Workout
- **No carbs needed** (Koutnik research: performance maintained)
- Electrolytes 30 min before
- Optional: Black coffee for energy
- 10g creatine monohydrate daily (not meal-dependent)

### Post-Workout
- Next scheduled meal (protein within 2 hours)
- Don't worry about "anabolic window" carbs
- Electrolytes for recovery

### Training Adjustments by Phase

**Week 1-3 (Adaptation)**:
- Strength MAY dip 5-10% (temporary)
- Reduce volume slightly if needed
- Keep intensity high (lift heavy, fewer sets)
- Focus on compound movements
- Don't add new exercises

**Week 4+ (Adapted)**:
- Strength should return to baseline
- Can increase volume again
- Energy more stable between sets
- Recovery often improves

### Key Supplements

| Supplement | Dosage | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Creatine Monohydrate** | 5-10g/day | Strength preservation, ATP regeneration |
| **Magnesium Glycinate** | 400mg/night | Recovery, sleep, cramp prevention |
| **Vitamin D3** | 2000-5000 IU/day | Hormone support, immune function |
| **Omega-3 Fish Oil** | 2-3g/day | Inflammation, recovery |

**Note**: Protein powder is fine if needed to hit 180-200g, but whole food preferred.

- First real fat loss visible (1-2 lbs actual fat)
- Sleep improving

**Actions**:
- Maintain electrolyte protocol
- Can increase training volume
- Notice energy more stable
- Cravings decreasing

### Month 2: Keto-Adapted
**What to Expect**:
- Consistent energy (no crashes)

### Month 3: Optimized
**What to Expect**:
- 7-10 lbs total fat loss achieved
- Muscle mass preserved (verify with measurements)
- Metabolically flexible
- Reduced carb dependency
- Stable mood and energy
- Cognitive performance maintained or improved

**Decisions**:
- Continue keto for more fat loss?
- Transition to cyclical keto (carbs around workouts)?
- Maintain with slightly higher carbs (50-100g)?
- Established metabolic flexibility regardless

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Strength Still Declining After Week 4

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Deficit too aggressive** → Increase to 2100-2200 cal/day
2. **Not enough protein** → Verify hitting 180-200g daily
3. **Electrolytes still low** → Double sodium intake for a week
4. **Sleep quality poor** → Prioritize 8+ hours, magnesium before bed
5. **Training volume too high** → Reduce sets, keep intensity

### Issue: Brain Fog Persists Beyond Week 2

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Sodium too low** → Add 1000-2000mg more daily
2. **Not actually in ketosis** → Hidden carbs? Check labels
3. **Dehydration** → Drink more water WITH electrolytes
4. **MCT oil** → Add 1 tbsp to morning coffee for quick ketones

### Issue: Can't Sleep

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Low magnesium** → Increase to 500-600mg glycinate before bed
2. **Eating too late** → Last meal 3+ hours before bed
3. **Too much caffeine** → Cut off by noon
4. **Cortisol spike** → This normalizes in week 2-3

### Issue: Constant Hunger

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Fat too low** → Increase dietary fat (add butter, olive oil)
2. **Protein too low** → Verify 180-200g
3. **Eating too fast** → Slow down, 20 min per meal
4. **Habit not hunger** → Drink water + salt, wait 30 min

### Issue: Digestive Issues (Constipation)

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Not enough fiber** → More green vegetables
2. **Dehydration** → More water with electrolytes
3. **Magnesium deficiency** → Increase dose
4. **Fat adaptation** → Normal, usually resolves week 2-3

## Red Flags: When to Adjust

**Increase Calories If**:
- Strength consistently declining after week 4
- Sleep quality tanking despite magnesium
- Libido crashes (hormone disruption)
- Mood severely impacted (depressed, irritable)
- Recovery taking forever (still sore after 4+ days)
- Getting sick frequently

**These indicate deficit too aggressive**, not keto failure.

**Consider Stopping If**:
- Severe adverse reactions
- Medical concerns arise
- Doctor advises against it
- Mental health significantly impacted

---

## Simplest Version

If the above is overwhelming, just follow this:

**Every Meal (3x daily)**:
- 8oz fatty meat (beef, pork, chicken thighs, lamb)
- Handful of green vegetables cooked in butter/oil
- Salt LIBERALLY
- Water with electrolytes throughout day

**Afternoon (Pre-Workout)**:
- 150-200ml fresh juice (orange-ginger OR beetroot-ginger)
- Heavy on the ginger (immune system non-negotiable)

**Daily Non-Negotiables**:
- Salt everything
- Drink water with electrolytes
- Fresh ginger juice in afternoon
- Magnesium before bed
- Don't snack (just eat 3 meals)

**That's it. Don't overthink.**

---

## Meal Prep Strategy

### Sunday Prep (2 hours)
1. **Cook proteins**: Grill chicken thighs, cook ground beef, hard boil eggs
2. **Roast vegetables**: Sheet pan broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts
3. **Prep salads**: Wash greens, chop vegetables, store in containers
4. **Make bone broth**: Or buy quality pre-made
5. **Portion fats**: Measure out nuts, cut avocados day-of

### Daily Assembly
- Grab pre-cooked protein
- Add pre-roasted or fresh vegetables
- Add fat (olive oil, butter, avocado)
- Salt liberally
- Eat

**Time Saved**: No decision fatigue, no daily cooking, consistency maintained

## Integration with Other Protocols

### With Sauna (Bryan Johnson)
- Electrolytes even MORE critical (you're losing more through sweat)
- May need 50% more sodium on sauna days
- Hydrate aggressively before/after
- Don't sauna fasted until keto-adapted (week 4+)

### With Intermittent Fasting
- Can combine once keto-adapted (week 4+)
- 16:8 or 18:6 windows work well
- Eat 2-3 meals in feeding window
- Maintain same macros, just compressed time
- Electrolytes during fasting window (no calories)

### With Cold Therapy
- May feel colder initially (keto affects thermoregulation temporarily)
- Brown fat activation increased on keto (bonus)
- Stay hydrated, maintain electrolytes

### With Zone 2 Cardio
- Perfect combination for fat oxidation training
- Do Zone 2 fasted once adapted
- Teaches body to burn fat efficiently
- Improves mitochondrial function

---

## Tracking Progress

### Weekly Measurements
- **Weight**: Same day, same time (morning after bathroom)
- **Waist**: At navel, relaxed
- **Hips**: Widest point
- **Chest**: At nipple line
- **Arms**: Flexed, widest point

### Monthly
- **Progress photos**: Front, side, back (same lighting)
- **Strength benchmarks**: Track key lifts (squat, deadlift, bench, etc.)
- **Energy levels**: 1-10 subjective rating
- **Cognitive function**: Note focus, clarity, productivity

### What Matters Most
1. **Strength maintained or improved** (not just scale weight)
2. **Waist circumference decreasing** (visceral fat loss)
3. **Energy stable throughout day**
4. **Cognitive function maintained**
5. **Sustainable and enjoyable**

## Quick Start Checklist

**Before Starting**:
- [ ] Buy groceries from shopping list
- [ ] Stock electrolytes (salt, Lite Salt, magnesium)
- [ ] Clear carb-heavy foods from house (reduce temptation)
- [ ] Inform household of plan
- [ ] Set realistic expectations (week 1-2 will be hard)
- [ ] Schedule lighter training for first two weeks

**Week 1 Daily**:
- [ ] Eat 3 meals as outlined
- [ ] Track protein (aim for 180-200g)
- [ ] Salt everything liberally
- [ ] Drink water with electrolytes (minimum 100oz)
- [ ] Take magnesium before bed
- [ ] Get 8+ hours sleep

**Ongoing**:
- [ ] Weekly weigh-in (same conditions)
- [ ] Monthly measurements and photos
- [ ] Adjust based on results
- [ ] Stay patient (adaptation takes time)
- [ ] Trust the process (research supports this)

---

**Remember**: The first two weeks are the hardest. It's NOT the diet failing - it's adaptation. Push through with electrolytes, sleep, and consistency. Your body needs time to become a fat-burning machine.

**Expected Outcome**: 7-10 lbs fat loss over 3 months, strength maintained or improved, cognitive function optimized, reduced carb dependency, increased metabolic flexibility, immune system protected (no colds/flu).

**For**: Ricky (health optimization, strength preservation, fat loss, metabolic flexibility, immune resilience)

**Modified Low-Carb Philosophy**: This protocol prioritizes overall health over strict ketosis metrics. The proven immune juice protocol (years of no illness) is more valuable than being in deep ketosis. At 40-50g carbs, you'll still benefit from fat adaptation while maintaining immune function.
