# Every Day Carry (EDC) - Unix Philosophy Approach

**Created**: 2025-11-16
**Philosophy**: "Do one thing and do it well" - Each tool earns its place through excellence at a specific purpose
**Inspired By**: Ben Vallack's Unix philosophy framework, Mike Glover's tactical EDC approach
**For**: Ricky

## Core Philosophy

### Unix Principles for EDC
1. **Do one thing well** - Each item is the BEST at its specific function
2. **No multi-tools** - Avoid convergence devices that compromise each function
3. **Fast access** - One-handed retrieval is critical criterion
4. **No redundancy** - Each item has unique purpose
5. **Composable** - Items work together, individually replaceable
6. **Intentional** - Every item consciously selected for specific role

### Key Questions for Each Item
- Does it do ONE thing excellently?
- Can I access it with one hand quickly?
- Is it the best tool for this specific purpose?
- Does it earn its weight/space?
- Would I be worse off with a multi-tool version?

---

### Phone (Reluctantly Included)
**Purpose**: Connectivity bridge, apps, emergency communication

**Unix Philosophy Approach** (Ben Vallack):
- Use OLDEST phone that still works for essential apps
- **Don't use for**: Camera, music, gaming, social media, computing
- **Use for**: Parking apps, 2FA, emergency calls, GPS (car), Bluetooth bridge

**Ben's Example**: 2016 iPhone SE (10-year-old phone)

**Decentralize these functions**:
- ❌ Timekeeping → Watch
- ❌ Photography → Dedicated camera (if passionate)
- ❌ Flashlight → Pocket torch
- ❌ Music → iPod or dedicated device
- ❌ Computing → Laptop
- ❌ Gaming → Console/PC
- ✅ Phone calls
- ✅ Essential apps (parking, banking, 2FA)
- ✅ GPS navigation (in car)
- ✅ Emergency contact

**Goal**: Make phone boring again. Reduce screen time naturally.

## SEASONAL/SITUATIONAL EDC

### Summer Addition
- **Sunglasses** - Eye protection, single purpose
- **Chapstick with SPF** - Lip protection

### Winter Addition
- **Gloves** (thin, touchscreen-compatible)
- **Hand warmer packets**

### Urban Environment
- **Transit card** (if applicable)
- **Parking app** (phone)
- **AirTag/Tile** (if tracking needed)

### Rural/Outdoor
- **Ferro rod** (backup fire)
- **Compass** (button compass on watchband)
- **Whistle** (signal device)

---

## WHAT NOT TO CARRY (Anti-Unix)

### Multi-Tools
**Why Not**: Compromise each function, heavy, slow access, redundant

- ❌ Leatherman (pliers useful but everything else inferior)
- ❌ Swiss Army Knife (scissors useful but blade unusable one-handed)
- ❌ Gerber multi-plier (same issues)

**Better Alternative**: Carry the ONE tool from multi-tool you actually need
- Need scissors? Tiny Victorinox Classic ($20) - almost just scissors
- Need pliers? Dedicated needle-nose pliers in bag/car (not pocket)

### Convergence Devices
- ❌ Phone wallet case (phone dies = no wallet)
- ❌ Smart glasses (fragile, expensive, compromised)
- ❌ Multi-function tactical pen (writing compromised, striking questionable)

### Things That Don't Earn Space
- ❌ Loyalty cards (use app or don't bother)
- ❌ Receipts (trash immediately or digitize)
- ❌ Coins (minimize, use card)
- ❌ Multiple knives (redundancy)
- ❌ Backup flashlight (one good one > two mediocre)

## EDC EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

### Monthly Audit Questions

1. **Did I actually use this item this month?**
   - If NO for 3 months → Remove or evaluate
   - If YES → Keep, it earns its place

2. **Is there a better single-purpose alternative?**
   - Multi-tool blade → Dedicated knife
   - Phone light → Dedicated torch
   - Phone timer → Watch

3. **Can I access it one-handed quickly?**
   - If NO → Different position or different item
   - Fast access is survival principle

4. **Does it do ONE thing excellently?**
   - If it does multiple things → Probably compromised
   - Exception: Naturally versatile (knife cuts many things, but one purpose)

5. **Would I recommend this specific item to someone else?**
   - If NO → Why are you carrying it?
   - If YES → You've found the right tool

## PHILOSOPHY RECAP

### Ben Vallack's EDC Principles Applied

1. **Fast one-handed access is THE criterion** - If you can't get it out quickly, you won't use it when you need it

2. **Single-purpose excellence beats multi-purpose mediocrity** - Your knife is better than any multi-tool blade

3. **Intentionality provides greater reward than convenience** - Consciously choosing each item yields satisfaction

4. **Lighter and more affordable** - Individual purpose-built items usually cost less and weigh less than convergence devices

5. **No obsolescence cycle** - Your Spyderco doesn't need annual upgrades like your phone

6. **Replaceable independently** - Can upgrade knife without replacing entire system

### Mike Glover's Tactical Perspective Added

1. **Tool selection for specific scenarios** - Each item addresses real situation
2. **Operator mindset** - Prepared but not paranoid
3. **Self-reliance** - Don't depend on phone for everything
4. **Train with your tools** - Familiarity breeds competence

## QUOTES TO REMEMBER

**Ben Vallack**:
> "If it's not fast, it doesn't work. I'll go up the ladder and find it's dark. My brain fails to prepare, but I know the torch is in my pocket, and I can get it out with one hand while holding the ladder."

> "The greater reward comes from intentionality. Doing things more intentionally with purpose-built items is the better reward than just pursuing convenience."

**Key Question**:
> "Does this do ONE thing excellently, or is it compromised by trying to do everything?"
