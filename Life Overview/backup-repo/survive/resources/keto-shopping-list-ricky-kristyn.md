# Weekly Modified Low-Carb Shopping List - Ricky & Kristyn

**Created**: 2025-11-16
**Updated**: 2025-11-16 (Added immune juice protocol, removed fish)
**Duration**: 1 Week
**For**: 2 people

---

## IMPORTANT: Modified Low-Carb (Not Strict Keto)

**Why Modified**: Your fresh ginger juice protocol (orange or beetroot based) uses 16-20g carbs per serving. This is a proven immune system practice (no cold/flu for years), so we're prioritizing this over strict ketosis.

**Result**: "Low-Carb with Immune Protocol" rather than strict keto. You'll still get many fat-adaptation benefits but may not achieve deep ketosis.

## Caloric Targets (Adjusted for Juice)

| Person       | Daily Calories | Protein Goal | Fat Goal | Net Carbs | Juice Carbs | Remaining Carbs |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | --------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **Ricky**    | 1900-2000      | 180-200g     | 130-140g | 40-50g    | ~18g        | 22-32g          |
| **Kristyn**  | 1300           | 100-120g     | 90-100g  | 35-45g    | ~18g        | 17-27g          |
| **Combined** | 3200-3300      | 280-320g     | 220-240g | 75-95g    | ~36g        | ~40-60g         |

**Note**: Increased carb allowance to accommodate immune juice. Still very low-carb (under 50g), just not strict keto (<30g).

## NOTES FOR KRISTYN

### Lower Calorie Adjustments
- **Smaller portions** of same foods (not different foods)
- **Skip the nuts** if calories too high (save 200 cal)
- **Lighter on fats** but don't go too low (hormones need fat)
- **Protein still priority** (100-120g for muscle preservation)

### Female-Specific Considerations
- **May need more electrolytes** during menstruation
- **Carb cravings** may spike pre-period (plan for it)
- **Don't under-eat** - 1300 is already low, don't go below
- **Iron-rich foods** important: red meat, spinach, eggs
- **Listen to body** - if energy crashes, add 100-200 cal

### Adaptation May Differ
- Hormonal fluctuations affect adaptation
- May take slightly longer than Ricky
- More sensitive to electrolyte balance
- Sleep and stress management extra important

---

## SUCCESS TIPS

### For Both of You
1. **Prep together on Sunday** - make it a routine
2. **Same meals, different portions** - easier cooking
3. **Track first 2 weeks** - MyFitnessPal or Cronometer (learn portion sizes)
4. **After 2 weeks** - intuitive eating based on learned portions
5. **Communicate** - if one of you is struggling, adjust together
6. **Celebrate wins** - energy improvements, strength maintained, fat loss

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Not enough salt (causes most issues)
- Hidden carbs (sauces, dressings, "healthy" foods)
- Not enough protein (muscle loss)
- Too much dairy (can stall some people)
- Snacking (stick to 3 meals)
- Comparing results (you'll adapt differently)

---

**Good luck! The first two weeks are the hardest. Push through with electrolytes, sleep, and each other's support. By week 4 you'll both be keto-adapted and feeling great.**
