# Field Test Protocol

## Purpose
Systematic approach to validating survival techniques through practical application. Ensures safe, documented, and objective testing of skills learned from books and podcasts.

## Safety First

### Pre-Test Risk Assessment
- [ ] Identify potential hazards
- [ ] Establish safety margins
- [ ] Have backup plans/equipment
- [ ] Know when to abort
- [ ] Have communication/emergency plan
- [ ] Check weather conditions
- [ ] Inform someone of plans

### Risk Categories
- **LOW**: Practiced in safe environment, minimal consequence of failure
- **MEDIUM**: Some risk, but mitigable with preparation
- **HIGH**: Significant risk, requires expert supervision or staged approach

**DO NOT field test HIGH risk techniques solo until achieving proficiency in controlled environment**

```

## During Test: Observation Log

### Real-Time Notes Format
```
[HH:MM] - Action taken
        - Observation
        - Difficulty encountered
        - Adjustment made
        - Result

Example:
[09:15] - Started bow drill fire attempt
        - Wood selection: oak for fireboard, poplar for spindle (per book rec)
        - Difficulty: maintaining downward pressure while maintaining speed
        - Adjustment: changed hand position on bearing block
        - Result: smoke after 45 seconds, ember after 2 minutes
```

### Photo Documentation
- Before: Setup, equipment, materials
- During: Key steps, technique details
- After: Results, final product
- Failures: What went wrong (valuable data)

### Vital Measurements
Depending on technique:
- Time to completion
- Resources consumed
- Physical effort (subjective 1-10)
- Quality of result
- Durability/longevity
- Effectiveness rating

```

### Detailed Write-Up (within 3 days)
File location: `experiments/field-tests/[YYYY-MM-DD]-[technique-name].md`

Include:
1. Complete test plan (reference)
2. Observation log (raw data)
3. Photos with captions
4. Analysis and interpretation
5. Military comparison (if applicable)
6. Recommendations for others
7. Updates to skill documentation

## Repeat Testing Protocol

### When to Repeat Test
- Initial failure (determine if technique is flawed or execution was poor)
- Partial success (refine approach)
- Success in ideal conditions (test in degraded conditions)
- After skill gap identified (practice then retest)
- Seasonal variation (technique may work differently)

### Progressive Difficulty
```
Test 1: Ideal conditions, all recommended equipment
Test 2: Good conditions, standard equipment
Test 3: Fair conditions, minimal equipment
Test 4: Poor conditions, improvised equipment
Test 5: Realistic scenario, time pressure
```

### Skill Progression Tracking
```markdown
## [Technique] - Proficiency Log

| Date | Test # | Conditions | Success | Time | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|---------|------|-------|
|      |        |            |         |      |       |

Proficiency assessment:
- Novice (0-2 successes)
- Beginner (3-5 successes, ideal conditions)
- Intermediate (6-10 successes, various conditions)
- Advanced (10+ successes, degraded conditions)
- Expert (can teach, adapt, improvise)

Current level: [X]
Goal level: [Y]
Gap: [What's needed to advance]
```

## Validation Standards

### Technique is "VALIDATED" when:
- [ ] Successfully performed 3+ times
- [ ] Tested in various conditions
- [ ] Results match source claims
- [ ] Can be reliably repeated
- [ ] Documented with evidence
- [ ] Cross-referenced with other sources

### Technique is "MODIFIED" when:
- [ ] Source technique works but needs adjustment
- [ ] Climate/regional variation required
- [ ] Equipment substitution necessary
- [ ] More efficient method discovered
- [ ] Safety improvement made

### Technique is "REJECTED" when:
- [ ] Repeatedly fails despite correct execution
- [ ] Unsafe in practical application
- [ ] Better alternatives exist
- [ ] Resource requirements impractical
- [ ] Claims don't match reality

## Integration with Knowledge Base

### After Each Field Test
1. Update skill file with test results
2. Add validation status to skills/INDEX.md
3. Note in original source (book/podcast file)
4. Add to experiments log
5. Update cross-references

### Quarterly Review
- [ ] Identify techniques with validation gaps
- [ ] Schedule tests for priority skills
- [ ] Review rejected techniques (new info/methods?)
- [ ] Analyze success/failure patterns
- [ ] Adjust testing approach based on results

## Field Test Safety Checklist

Before ANY field test:
- [ ] Risk assessment completed
- [ ] Someone knows your location/plans
- [ ] Emergency contact method available
- [ ] First aid kit accessible
- [ ] Weather checked and acceptable
- [ ] Abort conditions defined
- [ ] Backup equipment available
- [ ] Hydration/nutrition planned
- [ ] Time buffer for unexpected delays
- [ ] Know your limits

Remember: **No skill validation is worth injury. When in doubt, add safety margin.**
