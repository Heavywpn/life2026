## Key Insights from Content

### Recipe: Shawarma-Style Marinade
**Ingredients:**
- Yogurt (base)
- Lemon zest & juice
- Cumin
- Coriander
- Chili powder
- Sumac
- Garlic

**Technique:**
- 2-hour marination in fridge
- Boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- Smoother side down first on grill
- Target temp: 62°C (Andy's preference) vs 70°C (official recommendation)
- Total cook time: ~10 minutes

### Recipe: Greek-Style Marinade
**Ingredients:**
- Olive oil (base)
- Dried oregano
- Lemon zest
- Garlic
- Chili flakes

**Same technique**: 2 hours in fridge

### Key Cooking Principles Extracted

1. **Simplicity Framework**: 90% of Andy's summer meals = grilled protein + rice + grilled vegetables
   - **Survival Application**: Repeatable, scalable system

2. **Texture Optimization**: Remove zucchini seeds to prevent mushiness
   - **Insight**: "Texture is why people don't like vegetables"
   - **Survival Application**: Better nutrition compliance if vegetables aren't mushy

3. **Carryover Cooking**: Applies to vegetables, not just meat
   - **Survival Application**: Fuel efficiency (don't overcook)

4. **Pan Selection by Protein**:
   - Chicken/Steak: Carbon steel pan
   - Fish/Eggs: Stainless steel pan
   - High-acid sauces: Avoid cast iron (deteriorates seasoning)

5. **Temperature Transparency**:
   - Andy pulls chicken at 62°C personally
   - Recommends 70°C for others (official guideline)
   - **Survival Application**: Understand food safety margins vs. overcooking

---

## Credibility Assessment

### Strengths
- **Authentic**: Actually cooks this way 90% of the time (not aspirational content)
- **Transparent**: Honest about personal preferences vs. official recommendations
- **Community-focused**: Responds to viewer feedback, adjusted posting schedule
- **Commercial experience**: References professional kitchen standards
- **Self-aware**: Acknowledges "shameless plugs" with humor

### Ratings
- Real-world experience: **4/5**
- Instructional quality: **4/5**
- Practical value: **4/5**
- Accuracy: **4/5**
- Honesty/transparency: **5/5**

### Potential Concerns
- Temperature recommendations below official guidelines (62°C chicken)
- Equipment-dependent (gas grill, modern kitchen)
- Not survival/preparedness focused (requires adaptation)
- Fresh ingredient focus (not shelf-stable)

---

## Survival Project Integration

### Direct Applications
1. **Marinade recipes** - Convert to shelf-stable versions (powdered garlic, dried herbs)
2. **Grilling techniques** - Transfer to outdoor/camping equipment
3. **Vegetable prep** - Texture optimization for better nutrition
4. **Simple meal framework** - Protein + grain + vegetable = repeatable system

### Field Tests Inspired (6 Total)
1. **Two-hour marinade comparison**: Test 2-hour vs overnight with citrus
2. **Seed removal impact**: Zucchini with/without seeds for texture
3. **Temperature validation**: 62°C vs 70°C chicken safety and taste
4. **Alternative proteins**: Apply marinades to pork, lamb, beef, wild game
5. **Outdoor adaptation**: Test on camping grill or open fire
6. **Shelf-stable conversion**: Create bug-out versions with powdered ingredients

### Questions to Research
- [ ] Food safety: Actual risk level of 62°C chicken?
- [ ] Marinade shelf life: Yogurt-based marinades in fridge?
- [ ] Dried ingredient conversions: Fresh garlic → powdered ratios
- [ ] Cast iron alternatives: Cooking high-acid sauces outdoors

## Open Questions

1. **Andy Cooks background**: Full professional history (which commercial kitchens?)
2. **Channel size**: Subscriber count, average views (for credibility assessment)
3. **Outdoor content**: Does he have camping/outdoor cooking videos?
4. **Budget focus**: Are there economical recipe series?
5. **Food preservation**: Does he cover storage, canning, fermentation?
6. **Equipment partnerships**: Any sponsorships to be aware of? (mentioned Gozney pizza oven)

## Notes for Future Updates

### When Adding More Andy Cooks Content
- Check for outdoor/camping adaptations
- Look for food preservation techniques
- Document any military/tactical connections (All Blacks video = team cooking experience)
- Track gear recommendations (potential commercial bias)
- Note any Tim Ferriss-style experimentation (efficiency focus)

### Integration Opportunities
- If Tim Ferriss MED cooking concepts apply → cross-reference
- If Fire to Fork covers same recipes → compare techniques
- If survival protein available → test marinades on wild game
