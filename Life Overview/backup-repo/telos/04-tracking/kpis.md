# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

*Last Updated: 2025-11-03*

## What This Is

KPIs are the vital signs of your life and progress toward goals. These are the numbers you track consistently to understand if you're moving in the right direction. Focus on metrics that actually matter, not vanity metrics.

**Key Principle:** What gets measured gets managed. But only measure what truly reflects your mission and values.

## KPI Principles

*Guidelines for effective tracking*

1. **Fewer is Better:** Track 5-7 vital metrics, not 50
2. **Consistent Measurement:** Same method, same time
3. **Honest Recording:** Don't game your own metrics
4. **Context Matters:** Note unusual circumstances
5. **Action-Oriented:** If metric is off, what will you change?
6. **Review Required:** Tracking without review is wasteful

## Correlation Insights

*Relationships between metrics you've noticed*

- When [KPI X] goes up, [KPI Y] tends to [go up/down]
  - Example: "When sleep quality is high, energy and deep work hours increase"

- [Pattern noticed across multiple metrics]

---

## KPI Adjustments

*Changes to what and how you measure*

**[Date]:**
- Retired: [KPI] because [reason]
- Added: [KPI] to track [what matters]
- Changed target: [KPI] from [X] to [Y] because [reason]
