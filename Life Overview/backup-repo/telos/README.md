# Personal Telos System

A personal life tracking system based on the [Telos Framework](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Telos) by Daniel Miessler.

## What is Telos?

**Telos** (Greek: "purpose" or "end goal") is a context framework for achieving radical clarity about your life's direction. It creates a living document that connects your deepest problems to your daily actions through a transparent, traceable chain of purpose.

## Core Principle

**Everything you do should trace back to a problem you care about solving.**

This prevents busy work and ensures your time aligns with your mission.

## The Telos Flow

```
Problems → Mission → Narratives → Goals → Challenges → Strategies → Projects → Journal
```

1. **Problems:** What fundamental issues do you care about?
2. **Mission:** Your life's work in response to those problems
3. **Narratives:** Stories you tell yourself about who you are
4. **Goals:** Concrete, time-bound outcomes
5. **Challenges:** Current obstacles blocking goals
6. **Strategies:** Your approaches to overcome challenges
7. **Projects:** Specific initiatives implementing strategies
8. **Journal:** Daily/weekly log of progress and insights

2. **Update Regularly:** This is a "streaming activity log" - keep it current
3. **Trace Backwards:** When starting a new project, trace it back: Project → Strategy → Challenge → Goal → Mission → Problem
4. **Be Honest:** Radical clarity requires radical honesty with yourself
5. **Review Consistently:** The review schedule is what makes this system work
6. **Use with AI:** Share your `telos.md` with AI assistants to get contextually relevant help

## Getting Started

1. Open `telos.md`
2. Fill out the "Problems" section (what do you deeply care about?)

4. Set 2-3 goals for the next 6-12 months
5. Start your first journal entry in `05-journal/`
6. Schedule your first weekly review

## Philosophy

This system is designed for:
- **Clarity:** Know why you're doing what you're doing
- **Alignment:** Ensure daily actions serve long-term purpose
- **Reflection:** Learn from experience systematically
- **Context:** Give yourself (and AI) deep understanding of your life
- **Adaptability:** Update as you grow and change
