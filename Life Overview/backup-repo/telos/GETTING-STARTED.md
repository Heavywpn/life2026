# Getting Started with Your Telos System

Welcome to your personal life tracking system! This guide will walk you through the first steps to make this system useful and sustainable.

---

## First Session (1-2 hours)

### Step 1: Understand the Philosophy (15 min)

Read `README.md` to understand:
- What Telos is and why it matters
- The core flow: Problems → Mission → Goals → Projects → Journal
- The principle of traceability (everything connects to a problem you care about)

### Step 2: Identify Your Problems (30 min)

Open `01-foundation/problems.md` and answer:

**"What fundamental problems do I deeply care about solving?"**

Think big. These aren't daily annoyances - they're the deep issues that:
- Break your heart
- You'd work on even without payment
- Would create massive impact if solved
- Connect to your sense of purpose

Start with 2-3 problems. You can add more later.

**Examples:**
- "Not enough people have access to quality education"
- "Climate change is destroying ecosystems"
- "People are disconnected from meaningful community"
- "Mental health resources are inaccessible"

### Step 3: Craft Your Mission (20 min)

Open `01-foundation/mission.md` and write:

**"What is my response to these problems? What am I here to do?"**

Your mission should:
- Connect directly to the problems you identified
- Feel inspiring and authentic to you
- Be big enough to matter, specific enough to act on
- Be something you can work toward consistently

**Example:**
- Problem: "People lack practical skills for career transitions"
- Mission: "Create accessible resources that help people navigate career changes with confidence"

### Step 4: Set 2-3 Initial Goals (20 min)

Open `02-strategic/goals.md` and set:

**"What concrete outcomes do I want to achieve in the next 6-12 months that serve my mission?"**

For each goal:
- Link it to a problem and mission
- Make it measurable
- Set a specific target date
- Define clear success criteria

**Example:**
- Problem: "People lack practical skills"
- Mission: "Create accessible career resources"
- Goal: "Launch online course with 100 students by Dec 2025"

### Step 5: Fill Out Your telos.md (15 min)

Open `telos.md` and complete:
- Problems section (copy from problems.md)
- Mission section (copy from mission.md)
- Goals section (copy from goals.md)
- Values section (list 3-5 core principles)

Don't worry about completing everything - start with these essentials.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Trying to Complete Everything at Once
**Don't:** Fill out every file in detail on day one
**Do:** Start with problems → mission → goals, build from there

### 2. Making Goals Too Vague
**Don't:** "Get healthier" or "Be more productive"
**Do:** "Exercise 4x/week for 12 weeks" or "Complete project X by Nov 30"

### 3. Skipping the Weekly Review
**Don't:** Only journal, never review
**Do:** Block 30 minutes every Sunday for review - this is what makes the system work

### 4. Perfectionism
**Don't:** Wait until your mission statement is perfect
**Do:** Write version 1.0 now, iterate as you learn

### 5. Disconnecting Actions from Mission
**Don't:** Add goals because they sound good
**Do:** Trace every goal back to a problem you care about

---

## When Things Feel Overwhelming

If the system feels too complex:

1. **Simplify to Core Practice:**
   - Morning: Review goals
   - Evening: Journal 3 sentences
   - Sunday: 30-min review

2. **Focus on What Matters:**
   - `telos.md` is your single source of truth
   - Keep it updated weekly
   - Other files are supporting detail

3. **Remember the Purpose:**
   - This system exists to create clarity
   - If it's creating confusion, simplify
   - Done > Perfect

---

## Getting Help

### Questions to Ask Yourself
- "Which problem does this goal solve?" (ensures connection)
- "What's my next smallest action?" (prevents overwhelm)
- "Is this actually important or just urgent?" (maintains focus)

### When to Update Files
- **Daily:** telos.md (current state), journal
- **Weekly:** goals.md (progress), challenges.md (status)
- **Monthly:** All domain files, KPIs, full review
- **Quarterly:** Mission/values reassessment, goal refresh
