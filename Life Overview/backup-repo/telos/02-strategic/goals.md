# Goals

## Goal-Setting Principles

*Personal guidelines for effective goals*

1. **Trace to Mission:** Every goal must connect to a core problem
2. **Make Measurable:** Clear success criteria, no ambiguity
3. **Time-Bound:** Specific target dates, not "someday"
4. **Weekly Review:** Check progress every week, adjust as needed
5. **Prune Ruthlessly:** Let go of goals that no longer serve mission
