## Document Purpose

This is my **Telos Context File (TCF)** - a living document that captures my essential context for personal clarity and AI collaboration. It connects my foundational problems to daily actions through a transparent, traceable chain of purpose.

**Flow:** Problems → Mission → Narratives → Goals → Challenges → Strategies → Projects → Journal

---

## Problems

*The three fundamental problems I care about solving:*

### P1: People Being Left Behind by Systems That Should Protect Them

Veterans abandoned by the military. People with disabilities can't find work. People trapped in crises with no escape routes. Charities struggling without proper support.

**Why it matters:** The Army abandoned me after 10 years - broke my body (13 bolts still in my leg, extreme tinnitus, time in wheelchair), lost my medical files, gave me no retraining. I know exactly what it's like to be failed by the system that should protect you.

### P2: Integrity and Service Replaced by Greed in Business

IT companies charge "what others charge" instead of value delivered. Service-first replaced by self-interest. Work ethic replaced by entitlement. Lying as default response.

**Why it matters:** I worked for greedy companies. I compete against MSPs overcharging for minimal service. My grandparents taught me service above self. East Timor showed me what happens when greed and power dominate. I cannot build a business model based on exploitation.

### P3: People and Businesses Vulnerable to Cyber Threats

Constant targeting and hacking. They can't defend themselves. Bad actors exploit this. Small businesses and charities especially vulnerable.

**Why it matters:** I have the skills to protect them (firewalls, security, Microsoft expertise). East Timor taught me what exploitation looks like. I cannot stand by while people get victimized when I can protect them.

## Mission

*My response to these problems - my life's work*

**Primary Mission (v1.0):**

**"I exist to protect and serve people who've been failed, broken, or exploited by systems that should have helped them - by proving every single day that integrity, service, and disability don't stop you from building something powerful."**

**How I Execute This:**

1. **Hire the people the system discards** - Veterans, people with disabilities, those needing life changes (my first employee Peter: lost legs and left arm to cancer - I hired him because I'd been in a wheelchair too)

2. **Protect the vulnerable from predators** - Cybersecurity for businesses and charities at fair prices

3. **Serve charities who serve others** - Massive discounts, Treasurer of Clayfield Toombul Subbranch, active Rotarians (Kristyn = club president next year), host Connecting Charities (5th year, 90+ attendees)

4. **Model integrity over greed** - Charge based on value delivered, prove service-first is more profitable

5. **Create opportunities to travel and experience life** - Don't be held back (grandparents' lesson)

## Current State

*Snapshot of where I am right now*

**Date:** 2025-11-16 (Q1 Day 13 of 90 - Week 2 - Sunday)

**Energy level:** 7/10 (Sunday morning in Pottsville, 81% Whoop recovery - body recovered well after controlled drinking)

**Current Focus:**
- **Q1 Rocks execution** (Nov-Jan 2026): Day 13 of 90, Week 2 ending today
- **Week 2 review due TONIGHT:** NON-NEGOTIABLE - most important practice in the system
- **Daily Telos practice:** Maintaining consistency with morning rituals and evening reflections
- **Ice bath/cold exposure routine** (Rock #4): 🟡 YELLOW - tracking at ~61.5% (8/13 days estimated), needs to build back to 90%+ trajectory
- **Location:** Pottsville (NSW beachside town) with Kristyn - supporting her Rotary President training weekend
- **Today's schedule:** Beach walk with Kristyn (ocean swim opportunity) → Cafe breakfast → Rotary AGM → Drive home to Brisbane → WEEKLY REVIEW TONIGHT
- **Alcohol transformation PROVEN:** Saturday night in Pottsville - only 2 drinks total (1 wine each at dinner + 1 small drink), walked 1km back in rain, made love, 81% Whoop recovery next morning. This is what controlled celebration looks like.
- **Beer temptation test PASSED:** Saturday at services club waiting for Kristyn - sat alone, did NOT buy a beer, just sat and thought. Discipline becoming character.
- Running Venturer Technology & Core Computers
- Supporting Kristyn (Rotary president prep, KBN networking, gym partnership, business plan collaboration)
- Processing Sabre's loss (4 months ago)
- Managing constant physical pain (constant tinnitus, leg with 13 bolts) while staying active

**Recent Wins (Week 2 Nov 11-17 ending today):**
- **🎉 POTTSVILLE WEEKEND - PERFECT PARTNERSHIP DAY (Saturday):** Drove together in Mustang singing, market shopping (Kristyn bought fantastic dress + Ghana basket), soaked feet in clear creek together, Killan Falls waterfall adventure (cold water exposure counts for Rock #4), farm shop honey/cheese tradition, celebrated her Rotary training, Pippit restaurant duck dinner, walked in rain, made love. This is the life you're protecting.
- **🎉 KILLAN FALLS WATERFALL (Saturday):** Mountain drive alone in Mustang, thinking time in clear air, sat under waterfall in very clear cold water - felt like ice bath. Creative solution for Rock #4 when away from home.
- **🎉 ALCOHOL DISCIPLINE SOLIDIFIED:** Services club beer temptation (didn't drink while waiting alone) + 2-drink controlled evening celebration + 81% Whoop recovery. The pattern is WORKING.
- **✅ KRISTYN LEADERSHIP SUPPORT:** Entire Pottsville weekend centered on her Rotary President training - drove her there, gave her space to learn, celebrated with her after. Partnership means supporting each other's growth.
- **✅ WEDNESDAY PATTERN HELD ON BRUTAL DAY:** Started 45% Whoop recovery, argument with Kristyn, Maddy mistake cost until 6pm, skipped lunch, no bathroom until 4:30pm - STILL did ice bath + no alcohol + reconnected with Kristyn. Pattern working even under extreme pressure.
- **✅ TUESDAY TATTERSALS CLUB WIN:** Walked into club lunch with guys drinking, stayed sober, didn't stay, went back to work. MAJOR test passed.
- **✅ REMEMBRANCE DAY SUCCESS:** Sold out badges, raised $40K+ for RSL veteran welfare. Pure P1 mission work.
- **✅ FARM ANGELS CHINCHILLA:** Trip success during week
- **✅ Clean food working:** Shared duck and strawberry dessert at Pippit (controlled portions), steak/pumpkin/asparagus earlier in week

**Week 1 Wins (Nov 4-10) - Foundation Set:**
- **✅ WEEK 1 REVIEW COMPLETED:** First weekly review done (3 persona analyses, patterns identified)
- **✅ BUSINESS PLAN COMPLETED:** 10-year vision, 3-year picture, 1-year plan DONE - sent to Dean and Kristyn for review
- **✅ FRIDAY TRANSFORMATION PROVEN:** Old pattern (beer + full bottle wine) → New pattern (controlled, intentional)

**Current Struggles:**
- **🟡 ICE BATH YELLOW STATUS:** ~8/13 days (61.5%), need to build back consistency. Saturday Killan Falls helped. Today = ocean swim opportunity.
- **⚠️ SELF-SACRIFICE PATTERN:** Skipped lunches, no bathroom breaks - when stress hits, sacrifices himself first. Saturday eating too much fried food/pizza when hungry = pattern repeating.
- **⚠️ MADDY SITUATION:** Still needs addressing - unreliability impacting customers. Rock #1 hiring urgent.
- **Physical state:** NSW daylight saving = up an hour earlier. Constant leg pain (13 bolts), tinnitus 24/7.
- **Tinnitus 24/7:** Never stops, gives no peace - but ice bath routine helping manage the urge to drink
- **Grief over Sabre:** 4 months ago, still miss him, 14 years of habit

**What Needs Attention:**

**TODAY (Sunday Nov 16):**
- **Priority 1: Ocean swim at beach with Kristyn** (Rock #4 cold exposure - 8/13 days, building back)
- **Priority 2: Support Kristyn at Rotary AGM** (Be present, be proud, listen - her leadership journey)
- **Priority 3: Drive home safely + WEEKLY REVIEW TONIGHT** (Non-negotiable week closure - most important practice)
- **Daily intention:** "Be present for the last moments in Pottsville, be the supportive husband at her AGM, and honor the weekly review tonight - because the learning loop is what makes all of this work."

**WEEKLY REVIEW TONIGHT - CRITICAL:**
Week 2 (Nov 11-17) has been rich: Remembrance Day badge selling, Tattersals alcohol control win, Farm Angels Chinchilla trip, Killan Falls waterfall moment, two days of magical Pottsville time with Kristyn. The three personas will have a lot to work with.

**QUARTER PRIORITIES:**
- Complete Rock #5 foundation files (values.md, narratives.md)
- Rock #2: Set specific MRR increase target (needs current revenue data)
- Rock #6: Plan Kristyn trip (destination decision) - Pottsville was beautiful, maybe consider?
- Rock #7: North QLD market research (online)

## Values

*Core principles that guide my decisions*

1. **Service Above Self:** From my grandparents - you do the right thing because it's right, not because it's profitable. Guides hiring (veterans, disabilities, life-changers), charity work, pricing integrity.

2. **Don't Be Held Back:** From my grandparents - physical limitations, disability, pain don't define what's possible. Travel, experience life, refuse to let broken body limit living fully.

3. **Protect the Vulnerable:** From East Timor - witnessed exploitation, cannot unsee it. Use my skills (cybersecurity) to protect those who can't defend themselves. Predators targeting the defenseless is intolerable.

4. **Prove Through Action:** Talk is cheap. Peter thriving proves people with disabilities succeed with opportunity. Venturer's growth proves integrity beats greed. Show don't tell.

5. **Break the Cycle:** My father beat us. I chose my grandparents' way. Model for Parker and Ronin that service, courage, and showing up despite difficulty is what matters - not comfort or perfection.

## Wisdom

*Lessons learned that I want to remember*

- **"The magic you're looking for is in the work you're avoiding"** - The ice bath routine I avoided for years is working better than alcohol ever did. **Pattern confirmed (Days 1-4):** Skip ice bath = strong wine craving. Complete ice bath = felt great, controlled drinking, quality time with Kristyn. **Friday transformation proven:** Old pattern = beer at office + full bottle wine at home. New pattern = 1 gin & tonic, large glass milk, no desire for more.

- **East Timor lesson:** When you witness exploitation, you can never unsee it. That burden becomes responsibility to build the opposite.

- **From wheelchair experience:** People with disabilities don't need pity, they need opportunity. When I hired Peter, I wasn't being charitable - I understood what he needed because I'd been there.

- **The Army taught me:** Systems that should protect you can fail you systematically. Don't wait for systems to change - build the alternative yourself.

- **Pattern noticed:** Physical activity (ice baths, working out despite pain) correlates strongly with mood regulation and ability to resist drinking. Movement matters even when it hurts.

- **Kristyn showed me:** "Never leaving" is the greatest gift. She stayed through East Timor trauma, discharge, rebuilding, drinking. That's what partnership means. **26 years together and love growing stronger** - cooking from garden vegetables together, sauna together, ice bath together, building life with our hands.

- **From building Venturer:** Service-first is MORE profitable long-term than greed-first. Competitors charge maximum/deliver minimum and churn clients. We charge fairly/deliver excellently and clients stay. Integrity IS the better business model.

- **Energy management (Days 1-3):** Energized by leading/shaping culture (BNI VP, brand new chapter). Drained by imbalanced effort (Action Network - few organize, many complain). Put energy where I can set the standard, not where I'm compensating for others.

- **Mission tension - protecting vs failing (Maddy situation):** Sometimes protecting the mission means making hard decisions about unreliable people, even when they fit the mission perfectly. Can't help anyone if the business fails or team burns out. Integrity (P2) = honesty about what's working, not enabling what isn't.

- **Dean's wisdom:** "Ice bath isn't selfish, it's operational readiness." Missing strategic work (TruMethods meeting) to do staff small tasks proves the point - protect health routines or can't lead effectively.

- **Boys evolution:** Parker (22) and Ronin (20) building their own families now. My role shifted from directing to watching and enjoying their stories. Weekly connection working - not hovering, not absent, present. They're living proof Kristyn and I raised men who can stand on their own.

- **Preparation is soldier's work (Day 4):** "I am a soldier and can adapt to any situation with preparation and training." BNI prep failure showed the cost - disappointed myself because I didn't do the work. Food cascade showed the pattern - bad breakfast → grazing → fatigue → poor end of day. Routine fixes this.

- **Gym membership ROI (Day 4):** Very expensive gym for Kristyn and me BUT completely offset by reduction in alcohol purchases. The transformation isn't costing, it's saving while building health.

- **Kristyn's groove (Day 4):** She's shy in public but when left alone to find her own way, excels. Gym working better when we work out apart, meet for sauna/pools. Both finding our rhythm, she's enjoying it more. Partnership isn't doing everything together, it's supporting each person's way.

- **Ego at almost 50 (Day 4):** People stop and watch me lift because I'm built like a tank. "It is ego but I like it at my age. People cannot believe I am almost 50." Own it. The work shows.

- **Controlled celebration vs nightly habit (Week 2):** Pottsville weekend proved the difference. Saturday: 2 drinks total with wife after magical day supporting her Rotary training → 81% Whoop recovery. This is intentional celebration, not self-medication. The body knows the difference - 81% recovery tells you when drinking serves you vs destroys you.

- **Beer temptation test - discipline becoming character (Week 2):** Services club, alone, waiting for Kristyn, easy place to grab a beer. Old pattern would have bought one. New pattern: sat and thought, didn't drink. This is the shift from willpower to identity. You don't resist because you're trying hard, you don't drink because that's not who you are anymore.

- **Partnership means supporting growth, not just being together (Week 2):** Entire Pottsville weekend centered on Kristyn's Rotary President training. Drove her there, gave her space, celebrated her after, supported her AGM. She's stepping into leadership, you're stepping into presence. That's partnership - two people growing, not two people just coexisting.

- **Creative solutions for mission-critical habits (Week 2):** Can't do ice bath away from home? Find a waterfall. Killan Falls cold water exposure proves Rock #4 isn't about the specific method, it's about the commitment to cold exposure. Adapt, don't skip.
