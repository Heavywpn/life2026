# Problems

*Last Updated: 2025-11-04*

## What This Is

These are the fundamental problems I care about solving. Everything else in my Telos - every goal, every strategy, every daily action - traces back to these problems.

## Problem 1: People Being Left Behind by Systems That Should Protect Them

**Description:**

Veterans get abandoned by the military after service. People with disabilities can't find work because employers see their limitations, not their potential. People trapped in domestic violence or sudden life crises have no escape routes - no one will give them a chance. Charities struggle to serve their communities because they can't afford proper IT support.

The systems that should help people actively fail them - or worse, exploit them and then discard them.

**Why It Matters:**

**Because I lived this.**

The Army took 10 years of my life. They broke my body - 3 spiral fractures in my leg (13 bolts and a plate still in there), 2 rib fractures that don't line up, snapped arm, extreme tinnitus that gives me no peace. They put me in a wheelchair.

Then they "lost" my medical files in transit to Canberra, gave me no retraining assistance, and discharged me on crutches with no support.

**I know exactly what it's like to be abandoned by the system that should have protected you.**

I also know what it's like to have a body that doesn't work right and still need to build a life. When I hired Peter (lost use of his legs and most of his left arm to cancer), it wasn't charity. **I'd been in a wheelchair.** I understood.

**Current State:**

**Who else is working on this?**
- Some veteran organizations (inconsistent support)
- Disability employment programs (often tokenistic)
- Domestic violence shelters (underfunded)
- Pro-bono IT services (sporadic, unreliable)

**What gaps exist?**
- Veterans get no transition support from the actual military
- Employers won't hire people with disabilities because they see risk, not potential
- People needing life changes have no one willing to give them a real opportunity
- Charities can't afford market-rate IT services, so they struggle with outdated systems

**Why hasn't this been solved?**
Because helping these people isn't profitable in traditional business models. The market sees them as charity cases, not valuable employees or clients.

**If Solved:**

**What would change?**
- Veterans transition successfully to meaningful civilian careers using their discipline and skills
- People with disabilities build sustainable careers and prove they're assets, not liabilities
- People escaping crises get real opportunities to rebuild their lives with dignity
- Charities can serve their communities effectively with proper technology support

**Who would benefit?**
- Every veteran the military abandons (thousands per year in Australia)
- People with disabilities who have skills but no opportunities
- People trapped in bad situations who just need one person to believe in them
- Charities doing critical work in our communities
- **Me** - because I'm proving the system was wrong about what's possible

**How would I measure success?**
- Number of veterans, people with disabilities, and life-changers employed at Venturer Technology
- Retention rates (are they thriving, not just surviving?)
- Number of charities we support with discounted/subsidized IT services
- Impact those charities have because they can operate effectively

## Problem 2: Integrity and Service Have Been Replaced by Greed in Business

**Description:**

IT companies charge "what others charge" instead of what value they actually deliver. Businesses prioritize profit over service to clients. People lie as their first response - honesty is seen as weakness. "Service above self" isn't the norm anymore - self-interest dominates. Work ethic has deteriorated into entitlement without sacrifice.

The IT industry specifically is full of companies overcharging clients while providing minimal value, treating it as a game of "what can we get away with" rather than "how can we serve well."

**Why It Matters:**

**Because I've seen both sides.**

I worked for greedy IT companies that treated staff poorly. I've competed against MSPs that charge based on "market rates" while delivering garbage service. I've watched the new generation expect everything while refusing to sacrifice or work for it.

But I was also raised by grandparents who modeled integrity and service. They taught me: you do the right thing because it's right, not because it's profitable. You charge based on value you provide, not what you can extract.

And East Timor showed me what happens when greed and power dominate - people suffer. Exploitation becomes normal. The vulnerable get crushed.

**I cannot build a business model based on the same exploitation I witnessed destroying lives.**

**Current State:**

**Who else is working on this?**
- Some service-first businesses (rare, often struggle to scale)
- Ethical business movements (mostly talk, little action)
- Industry certifications (focus on technical skills, not integrity)

**What gaps exist?**
- No one is proving that service-first + integrity can be MORE profitable than greed
- The IT industry standard is: charge maximum, deliver minimum
- "Market rates" are based on what others charge, not what value is worth
- New workers expect instant reward without earning it

**Why hasn't this been solved?**
Because greed works in the short term. You can make money fast by overcharging and under-delivering. Integrity requires long-term thinking and sacrifice.

Most businesses choose fast profit over sustainable service.

**If Solved:**

**What would change?**
- Businesses operate with integrity as the standard, not the exception
- Pricing is based on value delivered, not "what we can get away with"
- Service-first culture becomes more profitable than greed-first
- Work ethic returns - people understand reward comes from sacrifice and effort
- Clients can trust their service providers

**Who would benefit?**
- Clients getting actual value for what they pay
- Employees working in ethical environments
- The industry's reputation (currently seen as predatory)
- **My boys** - they can see that doing the right thing works

**How would I measure success?**
- Client retention rates (are they staying because we serve them well?)
- Profitability while maintaining integrity (proving it's sustainable)
- Employee satisfaction (do people want to work here?)
- Industry recognition (are others following this model?)

## Problem 3: People and Businesses Are Vulnerable to Cyber Threats They Can't Defend Against

**Description:**

People and businesses are constantly being targeted and hacked. They don't have the knowledge, skills, or resources to protect themselves. Bad actors exploit this vulnerability for profit, control, or destruction. Small businesses and charities are especially vulnerable because they can't afford enterprise-level security.

The threat is real, constant, and growing - but most people don't understand it until it's too late.

**Why It Matters:**

**Because protection is a form of service - and I have the skills to provide it.**

I have expertise in:
- Firewalls
- Microsoft security products
- Network protection
- System hardening

East Timor taught me what exploitation looks like. Cybercriminals exploiting vulnerable businesses is the same pattern - predators targeting those who can't defend themselves.

**I cannot stand by and watch people get victimized when I have the ability to protect them.**

Plus, charities we serve are especially vulnerable. If they get hacked, they lose donor trust, operational capability, and the ability to serve their communities. Protecting them protects the people they serve.

**Current State:**

**Who else is working on this?**
- Enterprise cybersecurity companies (expensive, target large corporations)
- Consumer antivirus companies (basic protection, not comprehensive)
- Government cybersecurity initiatives (slow, bureaucratic)

**What gaps exist?**
- Small businesses and charities can't afford enterprise security
- Most people don't understand threats until after they're hit
- Reactive (fix after hack) instead of proactive (prevent hack)
- Security is seen as cost center, not essential service

**Why hasn't this been solved?**
Because protecting small businesses and charities isn't as profitable as targeting enterprises. The market focuses where the money is, leaving the vulnerable exposed.

**If Solved:**

**What would change?**
- Small businesses and charities have enterprise-level protection they can afford
- Proactive security becomes standard, not optional
- Cyber attacks are prevented before damage occurs
- Communities and clients can operate safely without fear of ransomware, data breaches, or system compromise

**Who would benefit?**
- Small businesses who can't afford to recover from a cyberattack
- Charities whose entire operations could be destroyed by ransomware
- Communities served by those charities
- **My clients** - they trust us to protect what matters to them

**How would I measure success?**
- Number of clients with comprehensive security
- Incidents prevented (attacks blocked before damage)
- Zero successful breaches of clients under our protection
- Client confidence (they sleep well knowing they're protected)

## Connections

**How do these problems relate to each other?**

### Problem 1 & Problem 2:
The system abandons people (Problem 1) BECAUSE greed dominates over service (Problem 2). If businesses prioritized service over profit, they'd hire veterans and people with disabilities because it's the right thing to do. But greed says "hire only perfect candidates who need no support" - so vulnerable people get left behind.

**My solution:** Prove that service-first hiring (veterans, disabilities, life-changers) is MORE profitable long-term than greed-first hiring.

### Problem 2 & Problem 3:
Greed in the IT industry (Problem 2) leads to poor security (Problem 3). Companies charge maximum while delivering minimal protection because it's more profitable. Then clients get hacked.

**My solution:** Provide excellent security at fair prices, proving integrity + protection is sustainable.

### Problem 1 & Problem 3:
The people most vulnerable to being left behind (Problem 1) are also most vulnerable to cyber threats (Problem 3). Charities with limited budgets. Small businesses with no IT expertise. They can't afford protection, so they get victimized.

**My solution:** Protect the organizations serving vulnerable people, so they can keep serving.

**All three problems connect to the same root:**
Systems (military, business, technology) exploit or abandon people instead of serving them. I'm building the alternative: serve people, protect people, give people opportunities - and prove it's more powerful than greed.

## Evolution

**How has my understanding of these problems changed?**

- **2004:** Thought the Army abandoning me was a personal failure - realized later it's a systemic problem affecting thousands
- **2010s:** Thought greedy IT companies were just "bad apples" - realized it's the industry standard
- **2015:** Thought cybersecurity was just technical - realized it's about protecting the vulnerable
- **2020s:** Thought I had to choose between profit and service - realized service IS the better business model

**The pattern:** Everything traces back to East Timor. I saw what exploitation looks like. Now I can't unsee it. So I spend my life building the opposite.

## My Personal Connection to These Problems

**I am not an outside observer trying to "help" people.**

**I AM:**
- A veteran the Army abandoned
- A person with disabilities (constant pain, tinnitus, limited mobility)
- Someone who needed a second chance and had to create it myself
- A business owner competing against greed-driven companies
- Someone with the skills to protect people from cyber threats

**These aren't abstract problems. They're my life.**

Solving them isn't charity. It's survival. And proving the system was wrong about what's possible.
