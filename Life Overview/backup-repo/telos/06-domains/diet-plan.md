# Low Carb / Keto Diet Plan

*Last Updated: 2025-11-17*
*Start Date: 2025-11-16 (Sunday)*
*Duration: Few weeks trial*

---

## Purpose & Mission Alignment

This diet experiment serves the Telos mission by:

**Traced to Problems:**
- **P1 (People left behind):** Cannot serve others effectively if running on poor fuel
- **P2 (Integrity in business):** Modeling the discipline I preach to clients and staff
- **P3 (Protecting vulnerable):** Need sustained energy and clear thinking to protect clients

**Why Now:**
- Noticed carbs + eating late = poor sleep quality
- Sleep directly affects Whoop recovery scores
- Poor recovery → lower energy → more likely to reach for wine
- This experiment directly supports Rock #4 (ice bath discipline) by improving sleep/recovery foundation

---

## Current Protocol

### What I'm Eating

**Approved Foods:**
- Clean protein (chicken, fish, beef, pork, eggs)
- Green vegetables (broccoli, spinach, asparagus, kale)
- Healthy fats (avocado, olive oil, nuts)
- Greek yogurt (full fat, no sugar added)
- Coffee (black)

**Limiting/Avoiding:**
- Bread
- Rice
- Pasta
- Potatoes
- Sugar
- High-carb fruits
- Beer/wine (alcohol control already a focus)

**Meal Timing:**
- Stop eating 2-3 hours before bed
- This addresses the "eating too close to bed" pattern affecting sleep

---

## Daily Tracking (In Journal)

### Morning Entry
- **Breakfast:** What I ate, was it low carb compliant?
- **Supplements:** Any morning supplements taken
- **Hydration plan:** Water intake target for the day

### Evening Entry
- **Meals today:** Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner - were they low carb compliant?
- **Snacks:** What, if any?
- **Last meal time:** How many hours before bed?
- **Compliance score:** 1-10 how well did I stick to the plan?
- **Energy impact:** Did I notice difference in energy levels?

---

## Success Metrics

**What I'm Measuring:**
1. **Sleep quality** (Whoop sleep performance score)
2. **Recovery scores** (Whoop recovery %)
3. **Energy levels** (self-reported 1-10)
4. **Mental clarity** (focus during work)
5. **Compliance %** (days on plan vs off)

**Target Outcomes (After 2-3 Weeks):**
- Sleep performance consistently above 85%
- Recovery scores trending upward
- Sustained energy throughout day (no afternoon crashes)
- Reduced cravings for wine (theory: stable blood sugar = less craving)

## Connection to Other Health Goals

**Links to Rock #4 (Ice Bath 90%+ Compliance):**
- Better sleep → Better recovery → More discipline for cold exposure
- Stable energy → Less reliance on alcohol to unwind
- The pattern: Ice bath → no drinking → quality sleep → good recovery → energy for next ice bath

**Links to Rock #5 (Telos Foundation):**
- Diet experiment demonstrates commitment to self-improvement
- Models the "prove through action" mission principle
- Data from this experiment feeds into health.md domain file

**Links to Self-Care Pattern:**
- Week 2 review called out skipping lunch 3 days
- Low carb doesn't mean no lunch - it means BETTER lunch choices
- This plan makes lunch non-negotiable (protein + greens ready)

---

## Meal Prep Strategy

**Weekly Prep (Sunday):**
- Cook 2-3 proteins for the week
- Prep green vegetables
- Have quick options ready to avoid skipping meals

**Example:**
- Sunday Nov 17: Meal prep done after grocery shop
- Focus: Clean protein, green veges
- Ready to grab for Monday lunches

## Kristyn Partnership

- Shopping together for clean protein and green vegetables
- Cooking meals together (Sunday dinner example)
- Supporting each other's health goals
- She's also doing PT sessions and focusing on health at 47

## Experiment Timeline

**Week 1 (Nov 16-23):**
- Establish baseline
- Track energy patterns
- Notice sleep quality changes
- Compliance focus

**Week 2 (Nov 24-30):**
- Adjust based on Week 1 learnings
- Look for energy/sleep patterns in Whoop data
- Note cravings and how I'm managing them

**Week 3+ (Dec onwards):**
- Evaluate results
- Decide: Continue / Adjust / Stop
- Document findings for future reference

---

## Red Flags to Watch

**Stop or adjust if:**
- Energy drops significantly (not just initial adjustment)
- Performance in gym suffers long-term
- Mood becomes consistently negative
- Sleep gets WORSE not better

**Note:** Initial few days may feel different as body adjusts - this is normal with carb reduction.

---

## Integration with Daily Rituals

**Morning Ritual asks:**
- "What's your breakfast plan today?" → Reference this protocol
- "Lunch plan?" → Ensure it's prepared, low carb, not skipped

**Evening Reflection asks:**
- "How did you fuel yourself today?" → Check compliance
- "Last meal time vs bedtime?" → Track the eating-before-sleep pattern
- "Energy patterns?" → Note if low carb is helping

## Notes & Observations

*Update this section as you learn:*

**2025-11-16 (Sunday):**
- Started low carb decision
- Grocery shop focused on clean protein and green veges
- Meal prepped for week
- Hypothesis: Eating late + carbs = poor sleep

**2025-11-17 (Monday):**
- Day 2 of protocol
- Morning energy 9/10 (good sign, though also had good sleep from Sunday ice bath)
- Focus: Don't skip lunch, stick to protein + greens

---

## Review Schedule

- **Daily:** Track in journal
- **Weekly:** Review in weekly review (energy patterns, sleep data, compliance)
- **End of trial (3 weeks):** Full assessment, decide next steps

## Remember

This is an **experiment**, not a punishment. The goal is:
1. Better sleep (so I can recover and have energy for mission work)
2. Stable energy (so I'm not reaching for wine to regulate)
3. Clear thinking (so I can protect clients and serve my mission)

If it works, great. If not, adjust. Data-driven decisions, not dogma.

**This diet serves the mission by keeping the machine (me) running optimally.**
