# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **marketing presentations system** for Venturer Technology, an MSP business. It centralizes the creation, tracking, and refinement of business presentations that leverage the owner's unique military background (10 years Australian Infantry, East Timor liberation operations) to differentiate in the market.

## Core Philosophy

All presentations should:
- Lead with **authenticity** over generic corporate messaging
- Connect **personal military stories** to **business value propositions**
- Center on **fairness** as the driving principle
- Position Venturer Technology as a **business partner**, not a vendor
- Use the military background as proof of values, not just storytelling

└── tracker.md       # Status tracking for all presentations
```

## Workflow

### Creating a New Presentation
1. Copy from `templates/presentation-template.md`
2. Place in `active/` folder
3. Add entry to `tracker.md` with status, priority, and deadline
4. Develop content
5. Move to `archive/` when delivered

### Key Resources to Reference
- `resources/key-messages.md` - Core company messaging and value propositions
- `resources/story-bank.md` - Personal military stories and anecdotes to draw from
- `audiences/[type].md` - Specific guidelines for different presentation contexts

## Core Narrative Elements

These should appear consistently across presentations:

### Military Background
- 10 years Australian Infantry (belt-fed machine gun operator)
- East Timor liberation operations
- Fighting for fairness and opportunity

### The Central Hook
**"I spent 10 years fighting for fairness with a belt-fed machine gun. Now I fight for it with technology."**

### Military-to-Business Metaphors
- **Belt-fed weapon** = Sustained support (long-term engagement, not quick fixes)
- **Defensive position** = Proactive security (don't wait for attacks)
- **Suppressive fire** = Business protection (handle IT so clients can advance)
- **No one left behind** = Customer support philosophy
- **Clear the building** = Systematic problem-solving

### Unfairness in IT (What We Fight Against)
- Vendor lock-in
- Hidden costs and surprise bills
- Tech hostage situations (only one person knows the systems)
- Information asymmetry (clients don't understand what they're buying)

### Our Solution
- Transparent pricing
- No proprietary lock-in
- Documentation and knowledge transfer
- Plain-English explanations
- Partnership approach

## Presentation Architecture

All presentations should follow a three-act structure:

### Act 1: The Problem/Context
- Open with attention-grabbing hook
- Establish credibility through military background
- Present a specific challenge or unfairness

### Act 2: The Solution/Insight
- Share ONE specific military story (usually East Timor)
- Draw direct parallels to business principles
- Show how military training translates to business value
- Provide concrete proof points

### Act 3: The Impact
- Explain what this means for the audience's business
- Give specific, tangible benefits
- Clear call-to-action
- Callback to opening hook

## BNI-Specific Considerations

The primary active presentation context (see `audiences/bni.md`):

### Time Constraints
- Weekly 60-second commercials
- 10-minute feature presentations
- Must stick to time limits religiously

### Key Goals
1. Make it easy for members to refer you
2. Be memorable (stand out from generic IT providers)
3. Build trust through authentic storytelling
4. Demonstrate expertise without jargon
5. Show commitment to reciprocity

### Tone
- Professional but personal
- Educational, not sales-focused
- Own the military background (don't soften "belt-fed machine gun")
- Use visual contrast (military photos vs. business imagery)

## What to Avoid

- Generic IT jargon without plain-English translation
- Making it all about combat (you're selling IT services, not security)
- Disconnecting metaphors from business value
- Softening or apologizing for military background
- "Trust me" statements without proof
- Over-promising or guarantees you can't keep
- Standard "wife, kids, dog, childhood" generic presentations

## Tracker Management

Always update `tracker.md` when:
- Creating a new presentation (add to Active or Upcoming)
- Changing status (Planning → In Development → Review → Ready → Delivered)
- Moving from active to archive
- Adding new presentation ideas to backlog

Status definitions: Planning, In Development, Review, Ready, Delivered
Priority levels: HIGH (imminent), MEDIUM (scheduled), LOW (future/exploratory)
