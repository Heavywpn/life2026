---

- **Beachport** (Robe backup): (08) 8735 8153

---

## CRITICAL CONCERNS 🔴

### 1. BOOKING TIMING (CRISIS)
**Status:** Extreme urgency
**Problem:** Dec 23-Jan 2 = Peak of peak Australian summer season
- Most coastal campgrounds book 2-3 months ahead
- You're booking 50 days out
- Port Campbell & Robe NYE likely already full

**Solution:** Book today, have backups ready

### 2. BUDGET UNDERESTIMATED
**Current Budget:** $3,350
**Realistic Budget:** $3,850-4,200

**Why:**
- Camping: $600-700 (not $510) - peak season pricing higher
- Fuel: $660-720 (not $630) - fuel prices likely $2.10-2.30/L
- Food: $1,300-1,500 (not $1,260) - Christmas/NYE premium pricing

**Action:** Revise budget to $4,000 to be safe

### 3. BRUTAL DRIVE DEC 23-24
**Current Plan:**
- Dec 23: Brisbane → Coffs (660km)
- Dec 24: Coffs → Melbourne (1,000km, 10-11 hours!)

**Concern:** 10-11 hours driving on Christmas Eve = exhausting

**Better Alternative:** Split into 3 days
- Dec 23: Brisbane → Port Macquarie (550km, easier)
- Dec 24: Port Mac → Batemans Bay (550km)
- Dec 25: Leisurely Christmas Day drive to Melbourne (400km)

**Trade-off:** Extra night booking, but much more comfortable

---

## MODERATE CONCERNS 🟡

1. **Melbourne Decision Needed:** Camping or hotel/Airbnb?
   - **Recommendation:** Hotel/Airbnb near CBD for Christmas comfort
   - Worth the extra $200-300 after long drive

2. **Return Journey Not Planned:**
   - Flying or driving back?
   - **Decision deadline:** Nov 15 (if flying, book flights now)

3. **No Wet Weather Plan:**
   - 30-40% chance of rain any December day
   - Need backup activities if Twelve Apostles day is wet

4. **School Holiday Impact Not Emphasized:**
   - ALL of eastern Australia on holiday Dec 20-Jan 27
   - Expect massive crowds at Twelve Apostles
   - Early morning visits even more critical

---

## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS 🟢

**Missing from Packing List:**
- Fly nets/head nets (bush flies in Mount Gambier area)
- Sand pegs (coastal campgrounds are sandy)
- Vinegar for blue bottle stings
- Backup prescription glasses

**Missing from Itinerary:**
- Wildlife viewing optimal times (koalas: early morning or late afternoon)
- Rainy day alternatives
- Photography best times/locations
- Aboriginal heritage acknowledgement (Wadawurrung/Gunditjmara country)

**Missing Food Planning:**
- Christmas Day food decision (cook or eat out?)
- If eating out: Book restaurant NOW
- NYE food plan for Robe
