## GENERAL BACKUP STRATEGIES

**1. Hipcamp (Private Land Camping)**
- Download Hipcamp app
- Search along your route

- Often available when traditional campgrounds full
- Usually $20-40/night
- Variable facilities (read reviews)

**2. Free Camping (WikiCamps)**
- Download WikiCamps Australia
- Filter: Free camping
- **Reality Check:** Free camps Dec 25-Jan 2 = packed, unreliable
- Better as emergency backup than plan
- Most are "first come first served" = arrive early (by noon)

**3. Roadside Rest Areas (Emergency Only)**
- Many allow overnight camping (check signs)
- NO facilities (maybe toilet)
- Use WikiCamps to find ones allowing camping
- **Only use if absolutely stuck**

**4. Hotel/Motel Last Minute**
- Download booking.com app
- "Tonight" deals sometimes available
- Budget: $100-180/night
- Most towns on route have motels

**5. Adjust Route**
- If critical area (Port Campbell, Robe) fully booked
- Consider staying extra day elsewhere
- Example: Skip Port Fairy, stay Warrnambool 2 nights
- Flexibility = key to success
