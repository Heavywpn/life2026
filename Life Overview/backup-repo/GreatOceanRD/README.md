## Pro Tips from the Research

### Great Ocean Road Specific Tips

1. **Start EARLY at Twelve Apostles** - Arrive before 9am to avoid crowds (aim for sunrise!)
2. **Look UP for koalas** - Kennett River, they're in the trees above you
3. **Every lookout is different** - Stop at ALL viewing points, different angles
4. **Fuel strategy** - Fill up in Apollo Bay and Warrnambool
5. **Expect wind** - Coastal winds are strong, secure your tent!
6. **Gibson Steps** - Walk down to beach level (if seas allow)
7. **Don't rush** - It's called the Great Ocean Road, not the Great Ocean Freeway!

### Camping Tips

1. **Arrive by 3pm** - Set up in daylight
2. **Powered sites worth it** - For 12V fridge especially
3. **Camp kitchens are great** - Save gas, meet other travelers
4. **Peg EVERYTHING** - Coastal winds will take your tent away
5. **Quiet hours matter** - Respect other campers (10pm-7am)
6. **Wildlife proof food** - Ants and possums everywhere
7. **Make friends** - Fellow campers are usually awesome

### Money Saving Tips

1. **Cook at camp** - Can save $50+ per day
2. **Most GOR viewing is FREE** - Don't need to pay for best views
3. **BYO alcohol** - Much cheaper than tourist prices
4. **Fuel in major towns** - Cheaper than tourist stops
5. **Local bakeries** - Amazing meat pies, much cheaper than restaurants
6. **Camping vs hotels** - Saving $100+ per night!
