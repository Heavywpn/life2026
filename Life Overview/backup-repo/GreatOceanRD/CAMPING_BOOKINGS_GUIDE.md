## Booking Strategy & Tips

### When to Book
- **NOW!** Many sites accept bookings 3-12 months ahead
- December spots filling fast already
- Don't wait to "confirm dates" - you know your dates!

### What to Ask When Booking
1. "Do you have powered/unpowered sites for Dec [date]?"
2. "What size is your powered site? We have a Toyota Hilux" (confirm vehicle fits)
3. "Are pets allowed?" (if applicable)
4. "Is there a camp kitchen?"
5. "What's your cancellation policy?" (important for flexibility)
6. "Do you allow campfires/BBQs?"

### Payment & Cancellation
- Most require full payment or deposit upfront for peak season
- Cancellation policies vary - typically strict during Dec/Jan
- Consider travel insurance if concerned about cancellations
- Keep all booking confirmations organized

### If Campgrounds Are Full

**Alternative Strategies:**

1. **Free Camping**
   - Use WikiCamps to find free camps
   - Often more basic facilities
   - Less reliable for peak season
   - May be "first come" only

2. **Hipcamp Private Land**
   - Properties along your route
   - Often more availability than traditional campgrounds
   - Unique experiences (farmstays, etc.)
   - Book through Hipcamp app

3. **Hotels/Motels/Airbnb**
   - More expensive but guaranteed bed
   - Good backup option
   - Most towns have options
   - Book accommodations that offer parking for your Hilux

4. **Adjust Timeline**
   - Stay 2 nights where you can get bookings
   - Skip places that are fully booked
   - Build in flexibility

5. **Arrive Early at "First Come" Sites**
   - Some campgrounds don't take bookings
   - Arrive by early afternoon
   - Higher risk but sometimes works

## Free Camping Options (Backup Plan)

**Use WikiCamps to find current free camps. Some options:**

### NSW Coast (Brisbane → Melbourne leg)
- Hammond Road campground (near Anglesea)
- Various rest areas (limited stays, no facilities)

### Great Ocean Road Area
- Allenvale Mill Bush Campground (near Lorne) - Basic, free
- Sharps Camping area (near Apollo Bay) - Basic, free
- Note: Free sites fill up fast in December!

### Limestone Coast
- Various roadside rest areas
- Check WikiCamps for current options

**Free Camping Reality Check:**
- December = Peak season
- Free camps fill early in day
- Basic or no facilities
- Not reliable for tight timeline
- Better as backup than plan A
