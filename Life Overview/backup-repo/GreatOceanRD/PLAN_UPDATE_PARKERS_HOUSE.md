## 🏠 What If Plans Change?

If for any reason Parker's accommodation doesn't work out:

**Plan B: Melbourne Camping**
- BIG4 Melbourne Holiday Park: (03) 9354 3533
- Discovery Parks Melbourne: 1800 444 442
- Crystal Brook Holiday Park: (03) 9786 8155

**Plan C: Melbourne Hotel/Airbnb**
- Search "parking, Dec 24-26, Melbourne"
- Budget: $150-200/night = $300-400 total
- Still can see Parker during the day

**But this is very unlikely** - Parker has invited you, plan should work!
