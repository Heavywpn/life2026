## The Story

Owner **Belinda Ho** was inspired to open Shucks after a day eating oysters at North Stradbroke Island while in a small boat (tinny) looking back at the mainland - she knew she needed to create an oyster bar nearby.

Head Chef **Michelle Pickworth** (ex-Lighthouse Cleveland, Seven Seas Yeronga) oversees the kitchen, with a focus on local sourcing where possible.
