  

==**Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures provide clear evidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your behaviour and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity**==

  

==**But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker**==

  

### How to keep your habits on track

  

==**A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit**==

  

==**Once you got a streak going, your only goal is to not break it**==

  

==**Simply focus on showing up and add to your streak**==

  

==**Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple laws of behaviour change. It simultaneously makes a behaviour obvious, attractive, and satisfying.**==

### Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious

  

==**Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one**==

  

==**Research has shown that people who track their progress on goals are more likely to improve than those who don’t**==

  

==**The mere act of tracking a behaviour can spark the urge to change it**==

  

==**Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view of our own behaviour. We think we act better than we do.**==

  

==**When the evidence is right in front of you, you’re less likely to lie to yourself**==

### Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive

  

> ==**The most effective form of motivation is progress**==

  

==**When we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path**==

  

==**Each small win feeds your desire**==

  

==**Habit tracking provides visual proof of your hard work**==

  

==**You don’t want to lose your progress by breaking the streak**==

  

  

### Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying

  

==**This is the most crucial benefit of all. Tracking can become its own form of reward**==

  

==**Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on the process rather than the result.**==

  

==**You’re not fixated on the end result, you’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who does your habit consistently**==

  

==**Habit tracking:**==

1. ==**Creates a visual cue that can remind you to act**==
2. ==**Is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want tot lose it**==
3. ==**Feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit**==

==**Habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become**==

  

==**Measurement should be automated. Manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. Record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs**==

  

==**The completion of the behaviour is the cue to write it down**==

  

==**“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT]”**==

  

==**These tactics can make tracking your habits easier**==

  

==**Every habit streak ends at some point. And more important than any single measurement, is having a good plan for when your habit slide off track**==

  

### How to record quickly when your habits break down

  

==**No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that life will interrupt you at some point**==

  

==**Perfection is not possible**==

  

==**If you miss a day, try to get back into it as quickly as possible. You won’t be perfect but you can avoid a second lapse. As soon as one streak ends, start the next one**==

  

==**The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows.**==

  

==**Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit**==

  

==**The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast**==

  

==**Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. l The problem is not slipping up, the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly then you shouldn't do it at all**==

  

==**Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you**==

  

==**The first rule of compounding: never interrupt it unnecessarily**==

  

==**It’s not about what happens during the workout, it’s about being the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts**==

### Knowing when (and when not) to track a habit

  

==**The dark side of tracking a particular behaviour is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it**==

  

==**The human mind wants to win whatever game is being played**==

  

> ==**We optimize for what we measure**==

  

==**When we choose the wrong measurement we get the wrong behaviour**==

  

> ==**When a measure become a target, it ceases to be a good measure.**==

  

==**Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system**==

  

==**Each measurement provides a little bit of evidence that you’re moving in the right direction and a brief moment of immediate pleasure for a job well done**==
