00:00:29.988 Kevin Rose: I know what you're thinking.Tim Ferriss: You definitely bought that    
00:00:33.640 on PornHub.***   
00:00:49.668 Kevin Rose: Hello, friends and family. Welcome to the Random Show. I am here in my studio with Tim    
00:00:54.720 Ferriss. Tim, you're here in my house.Tim Ferriss: I know, it's so nice.   
00:00:57.360 Kevin Rose: Shouldn't say that my studio is in my house. We can still see that. It's fine.   
00:01:01.280 Tim Ferriss: It's in your Batcave.Kevin Rose: I'm glad you're here, brother.   
00:01:04.450 Tim Ferriss: Yeah.Kevin Rose: It's good to see you in person.   
00:01:05.501 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it's great to see you. I'm really, really thrilled that    
00:01:07.560 it worked out. And what better way to get off of my podcast sabbatical    
00:01:12.040 than with saying hi to my good friend Kevin.Kevin Rose: Yeah. How did that feel, by the way?   
00:01:15.747 Tim Ferriss: So the sabbatical, first time in 10 years that I've taken a break from the podcast,    
00:01:21.680 and it's been four months, roughly, of sharing a lot of the greatest hits. And    
00:01:28.760 it's been a combination of feeling fantastic. And I've been working on other projects that    
00:01:33.800 are really energy in for me, my first new book in the seven years that I've been working on.   
00:01:39.308 Kevin Rose: That's not a sabbatical, by the way.Tim Ferriss: Well usually though in fairness,    
00:01:43.760 the word sabbatical is typically used in academic circles. And when they take a break from teaching,    
00:01:49.640 they do other things. They do other things. And I think you and I, if we're being honest,    
00:01:53.880 are both working dogs. We can take breaks, but it's like you take some type of working dog, like    
00:01:59.000 a border collie, you stick it in your apartment in New York City and it doesn't run, and you're like,    
00:02:02.280 why is it chewing the couch? It's because it has to run. And so for me to do the deep    
00:02:06.240 work of books, specifically, is just a different shift, different gear than feeling the pressure    
00:02:15.920 of putting out a podcast once or twice a week.Kevin Rose: Do you think that idea of shifting    
00:02:19.680 between those two — podcast and then book, podcast, book, if you had to do that,    
00:02:23.760 it breaks up your train of thought too much or so much so that you wouldn't be able to    
00:02:27.360 have — do you need the undivided time?Tim Ferriss: You need the undivided time.   
00:02:33.530 Kevin Rose: Okay.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and I'll make a recommendation    
00:02:35.800 or something that makes it very clear. There is an essay by Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator,    
00:02:42.240 famous for many different reasons. Also spectacular writer, very good painter also    
00:02:46.640 I believe. But he wrote an essay called "The Top Idea in Your Mind," or "A Top Idea in Your Mind."    
00:02:53.640 And it talks about effectively attention as a currency and the importance of there's a separate    
00:02:59.160 one, maker's schedule versus manager's schedule, something like that. But the importance of    
00:03:03.000 uninterrupted blocks of time, particularly if for instance, you're dealing with a complex, this is    
00:03:08.720 true of coding for instance, also true of writing, where you're juggling 27 balls in the air.   
00:03:14.148 Kevin Rose: Right.Tim Ferriss: And if you get distracted    
00:03:15.880 and you drop four, you have to start over again. And you have to build that rhythm and it takes    
00:03:19.040 a really long time. So if I'm thinking about the pressures of, or the prep for, even if I'm having    
00:03:25.040 fun, of a podcast, it's basically robbing myself of let's just call it 20, 30, 40, 50 percent of    
00:03:31.720 the subconscious cycles that I could apply to the book even when I'm not thinking about it.   
00:03:37.600 Kevin Rose: For something like this, obviously we're just bullshitting, but I'd imagine a    
00:03:40.400 typical guest for you on the kind of research and due diligence side is like, is that a    
00:03:45.880 couple of days work for you in terms of —Tim Ferriss: A couple of days. In the case    
00:03:49.120 of some guests, it can be a few weeks if it's way outside of my normal areas of —   
00:03:53.104 Kevin Rose: Oh, interesting.Tim Ferriss: And even if we look at a few    
00:03:56.960 days, it's a lot of prep. It's a lot of thinking about the interview even when I'm done prepping,    
00:04:03.320 which avenues I might take based on answers that go in a particular direction. So I take    
00:04:08.240 the craft of podcasting very seriously, although it's been a chance also for me,    
00:04:12.320 and I wanted to take this sabbatical not just to work on the book, but to think about first    
00:04:17.640 10 years have been great. If I continue to do this, which I would like to do, how do I keep    
00:04:22.920 it as exciting for me personally as possible? And if I do that, can I differentiate it in a podcast    
00:04:32.960 ecosystem that is increasingly oversaturated?Kevin Rose: Yes. This is the reason I just    
00:04:37.680 stopped doing podcasts.Tim Ferriss: Yeah.   
00:04:39.908 Kevin Rose: Well, I didn't stop it, but I cut back to one episode every six weeks. It's because    
00:04:43.840 when I have a guest on, I totally get what you were saying, because I remember I hit you up,    
00:04:47.520 I had a dear friend that launched a new book and you're like, "Hey, I'm not doing any new books."    
00:04:51.080 And when you look at that person, great book, I loved it, they did 10 podcasts and they all talk    
00:04:57.560 about the same thing. So then you're just playing the like, okay, maybe I want Tim's version, maybe    
00:05:02.760 I want whoever else top ten podcaster out there.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You're eating kung pao chicken    
00:05:08.000 no matter what.Kevin Rose: Right.   
00:05:08.907 Tim Ferriss: It's just whose sauce is slightly different?   
00:05:10.828 Kevin Rose: Exactly. And it doesn't feel is additive to the ecosystem to just do the same    
00:05:15.320 thing that's going around on the circuit, right?Tim Ferriss: Yes. Let me get your take. Also for    
00:05:18.760 people listening, I would love your take. I'm doing a lot of reflection on my own,    
00:05:22.760 so I'm not just outsourcing this, but in terms of rules for myself moving forward, I've thought    
00:05:27.640 about a few things. One is to basically take a barbell approach where I'm interviewing people    
00:05:33.840 who effectively no one has ever heard of, right? So who knows, the popcorn king of Milwaukee or    
00:05:39.400 whatever, some master who has not ever made the rounds. Ideally it's someone for instance,    
00:05:44.600 who's never done a long form interview like Jocko Willink, the first time he was on the podcast or    
00:05:48.520 whatever it might be. Or on the opposite very far end, it's someone almost everyone would    
00:05:53.760 know like a Bezos or a fill in the blank, but very little in between because the podcasting    
00:06:00.280 circuit has largely become 20 or 30 podcasts at a time of book authors doing the modern equivalent    
00:06:08.440 of a radio satellite tour. And I just don't particularly want to participate in that anymore.   
00:06:15.108 Kevin Rose: Yeah. But with a Bezos, I'd imagine you're not going to go like, "Hey, tell me about    
00:06:19.440 Q4 of last year at Amazon."Tim Ferriss: No,    
00:06:22.460 I'd want to make it more personal.Kevin Rose: You going to be like, "Tell    
00:06:23.000 me about how was your divorce," or shit that you could get into, hopefully that    
00:06:27.560 is uniquely — you haven't heard anywhere else.Tim Ferriss: And I'd want it to be evergreen.    
00:06:33.200 I really don't want to, and this is to my economic detriment, but I don't want    
00:06:36.840 to chase the current controversy of the day. I don't want things that are going to expire    
00:06:41.400 in two months. I want my back catalog to be as interesting to people as the newer episodes.   
00:06:46.891 Kevin Rose: Yes.Tim Ferriss: And that's    
00:06:47.600 going to mean taking probably a pretty major financial haircut. But I'm totally fine with    
00:06:51.320 that at this point because also you have to think about, say, if you're thinking    
00:06:57.040 about the economic side of things, there's the short term and there's the long term. If I get    
00:07:00.920 so apathetic or bored that I stop doing the podcast, that's the end of the income period.    
00:07:06.840 So if I ratchet it back 40 percent, let's just say in terms of volume, but I do it for longer    
00:07:11.680 over time and my audience can tell that I'm really excited about the episodes that I'm putting out,    
00:07:17.200 which I in general have been. There are very few compromises I've made, but I can see the slippery    
00:07:21.440 slope of just taking whatever gets pitched to you by publicists for the latest and greatest    
00:07:25.680 book. So, these are all considerations —Kevin Rose: I love that, man. I think that's    
00:07:28.840 a great approach. I'd much rather see the longevity of Tim and higher-quality episodes    
00:07:33.880 than just banging them out every single week.Tim Ferriss: Oh, totally. And I really, I don't    
00:07:36.520 feel like I've made many compromises, but there have been a few where I'm like, I don't want to    
00:07:40.960 do this kind of interview again. And I've also thought in terms of format of basically doing    
00:07:46.200 co-hosted catch-ups with friends. So for instance, I might have, and none of these people have agreed    
00:07:51.280 so well, actually, I'm not even going to mention names, but you can imagine some of    
00:07:54.880 my closest friends who've been on the podcast who are very, very smart and good at asking questions,    
00:07:59.840 I catch up with them, they suggest a guest, they think we could interview together.   
00:08:04.828 Kevin Rose: That's fun.Tim Ferriss: And then I'm catching up with a    
00:08:06.040 close friend while we're interviewing someone.Kevin Rose: Oh, that's cool.   
00:08:08.787 Tim Ferriss: I think that would be great. I think that'd be super additive to my    
00:08:11.720 life. And then hopefully that transmits in the same way that I think a large reason,    
00:08:17.160 say, The All-In Podcast has become massively popular because of that interplay and it's    
00:08:23.200 fun. I always enjoy this type of banter and —Kevin Rose: We've got lots to cover today.   
00:08:29.147 Tim Ferriss: Why don't you hop in?Kevin Rose: Addison, are you around?    
00:08:31.520 We have my dear friend Addison who lives here in L.A. who is a part-time semi-professional    
00:08:36.679 bartender mixologist, not really, but he does that for fun. And he also does an AI company,    
00:08:43.039 part-time, called PicStudio.AI, which just came out with a new model. And you know how these AI    
00:08:50.520 models are changing so fast, right?Tim Ferriss: Yes.   
00:08:52.489 Kevin Rose: And so I would say when I was first messing around with this with him a while ago,    
00:08:55.400 it was pretty good. It was good. It was like I used it as a headshot for a couple of places,    
00:08:58.480 but you could still look at it, if you squinted, you'd be like, "AI." Right?   
00:09:02.461 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Uncanny Valley. You'd be like, "Wait a second."   
00:09:04.148 Kevin Rose: So they came out with the new model and I wanted to show you, we'll see    
00:09:07.440 if Addison is going to make us some drinks as well. I want to show you a couple pictures of    
00:09:09.800 yourself. Dude, this is a brand new model.Tim Ferriss: Holy shit. That's insane.   
00:09:13.868 Kevin Rose: Is that insane?Tim Ferriss: And we'll put these    
00:09:15.840 up on YouTube and other places so people can see the images. That's terrifying.   
00:09:19.708 Kevin Rose: Dude, how real does that look?Tim Ferriss: Looking good. This should be    
00:09:23.080 your new dating profile picture.Kevin Rose: You're a little preppy    
00:09:27.320 there. The cargo shorts.Tim Ferriss: I'm a    
00:09:29.040 little preppy, but this is like —Kevin Rose: The ocean looks nice.   
00:09:32.547 Tim Ferriss: What's crazy is the kind of full body dimension accuracy.   
00:09:37.868 Kevin Rose: Yeah.Tim Ferriss: That's nuts.   
00:09:39.548 Kevin Rose: Yeah. He was saying that you can use the prompt now to say    
00:09:42.000 this shirt type or is your Steve Jobs.Tim Ferriss: So looking at these photos,    
00:09:47.080 I would say even I would be like, wait a second —Kevin Rose: Did I take that photo?   
00:09:51.387 Tim Ferriss: Did I ever take that photo? No, that's not me. That is terrifying.   
00:09:56.228 Kevin Rose: I know.Tim Ferriss: It's terrifying.   
00:09:57.348 Kevin Rose: It's awesome though, at the same time.Tim Ferriss: It's awesome and terrifying.   
00:09:59.840 Kevin Rose: Yeah.Tim Ferriss: And in short order,    
00:10:00.720 we're already seeing memes turned into videos.Kevin Rose: Yes.   
00:10:03.587 Tim Ferriss: Right? It's going to be the Wild West.   
00:10:07.188 Kevin Rose: Is It's going to be crazy. Speaking of looking good though —   
00:10:10.667 Tim Ferriss: You're looking great.Kevin Rose: And I want to do your    
00:10:12.040 dating life update as well.Tim Ferriss: Oh, my God.   
00:10:14.868 Kevin Rose: But we need a drink first. Addison.Darya: Yeah, he's coming.   
00:10:17.508 Kevin Rose: Okay. Jesus. One job, two jobs, AI, and this. I'm just kidding. Just kidding.   
00:10:23.680 Tim Ferriss: Speaking of looking good, do you want to show off your tattoo?   
00:10:26.148 Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah. I just got a little crane here. Jess Mascetti on Instagram,    
00:10:30.920 she's amazing. New York-based tattoo artist. She's done Bruce Willis, a bunch of other    
00:10:35.480 really famous kind of people in the past.Tim Ferriss: I was wondering why you had    
00:10:37.480 Bruce Willis on your forearm.Kevin Rose: Yeah, exactly.   
00:10:39.747 Tim Ferriss: How did you choose that?Kevin Rose: So you probably know this,    
00:10:42.480 but in Japanese lore, children's books and others, the crane is a symbol of because    
00:10:48.120 of its length that can span Heaven and Earth. And so it's used as a bridge for    
00:10:52.920 souls to transfer between heaven and earth. I just like that lore. It's cool. And I got    
00:10:58.040 the meditator done by her on the front of me as well, so got both. She's insanely,    
00:11:02.920 insanely talented.Tim Ferriss: Very    
00:11:03.800 talented. Yeah. Beautiful artwork.Kevin Rose: We'll link to her profile    
00:11:06.600 in the old show notes. So you were looking really good on Instagram and    
00:11:12.160 you posted that you got a vampire facial done.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Vampire facial. Yeah. So I    
00:11:17.080 put up a photo which popped up on my phone. It was generated by the phone, and it had today,    
00:11:24.920 eight years ago, and it was a photo of me from eight years ago. And I realized,    
00:11:29.000 which I more or less hoped would be the case and really pushed forward to was like,    
00:11:33.600 all right, I lost my hair pretty early and then I looked older than my friends and I was like,    
00:11:37.000 I just need to make it the next 10 years and train my off and watch my diet. And I think I'll kind of    
00:11:41.960 flatline or plateau in terms of how I look.Kevin Rose: Right.   
00:11:45.947 Tim Ferriss: And so the photos made it look, I think I had largely not aged in eight years.   
00:11:51.508 Kevin Rose: It looked amazing.Tim Ferriss: It looked amazing.    
00:11:52.880 So I put up "Eight years on the Romanian Vampire Protocol trademark," and then I    
00:12:00.520 put (RVP) in parentheses, "will do wonders for your skin." And it was a total joke on my part.   
00:12:06.769 Kevin Rose: Right.Tim Ferriss: Unbeknownst to me, though.   
00:12:08.148 Kevin Rose: Well, you turned off comments too.Tim Ferriss: I turned off comments. Yeah, there's    
00:12:11.520 a lot of story behind that. We won't get into it.Kevin Rose: But the reason that was    
00:12:14.000 funny is because so many people —Tim Ferriss: I didn't get any of the feedback.   
00:12:16.708 Kevin Rose: Giving the feedback. There is such a thing as a vampire facial. And you were joking    
00:12:20.800 and I looked at it, I was like, oh, shit, Tim does the vampire too. I'm like, wow. He's been doing it    
00:12:24.280 for a long time. He's never told me about it.Tim Ferriss: So what is the vampire facial?   
00:12:27.788 Kevin Rose: So about a month ago now, I was at the dermatologist and you go in once a year and    
00:12:32.800 get all your warts and shit looked at to make sure you don't have cancer. And I go in there    
00:12:36.880 and they're like, "Hey, you want some good shit?"Tim Ferriss: Now that I'm looking at your eyes,    
00:12:41.480 we were talking about crow's feet and turning them back into crow knuckles. I don't see anything.   
00:12:46.268 Kevin Rose: It looks good, right?Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You    
00:12:47.240 don't even have crow knuckles.Kevin Rose: Thank you for the compliment.   
00:12:49.227 Tim Ferriss: You're welcome.Kevin Rose: But I will tell    
00:12:50.840 you that the options they have are all of the L.A. shit, which I don't want to do. I    
00:12:55.760 don't want to get botox all on my face and shit.Tim Ferriss: You don't want to be a lizard cat?   
00:12:59.120 Kevin Rose: Lizard cat?Tim Ferriss: Walk among the lizard cat people.   
00:13:01.382 Kevin Rose: Yeah, exactly. It just looks horrible. You can tell.   
00:13:04.747 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Please don't do that.Kevin Rose: But I'm sure you could get    
00:13:07.200 by with it for a couple years and then you look like a plastic dude.   
00:13:10.107 Tim Ferriss: So now vampire because they're taking out your blood.   
00:13:13.931 Kevin Rose: Yes.Tim Ferriss: Spinning it,    
00:13:14.880 creating something known as platelet rich plasma.Kevin Rose: Yes.   
00:13:18.120 And you've had that done before. Not the facial though.   
00:13:21.027 Tim Ferriss: No.Kevin Rose: So tell people why you did it.   
00:13:22.627 Tim Ferriss: Prior to The 4-Hour Body, or in the process of writing The 4-Hour Body, which is all    
00:13:26.640 about physical performance and modification and performance enhancement, that book was published    
00:13:32.400 in 2010, and at the time I was using PRP because it had been used at that time for certain types of    
00:13:39.120 joint degeneration or orthopedic issues related to joints. So I had interarticular joint injections    
00:13:47.520 in the elbows, shoulders —Kevin Rose: That's not    
00:13:49.040 the one you got infected by, was it?Tim Ferriss: One of them was sadly a disaster.   
00:13:55.748 Kevin Rose: Oh, boy.Tim Ferriss: And whenever you inject anything,    
00:13:58.800 there's a chance that you introduce pathogens through the skin. Now, what I did not realize    
00:14:04.000 at the time is that this particular clinic who will remain unnamed, when they injected the elbow,    
00:14:08.920 they used the wrong injection site. And so they disinfected the surface level of the skin. But    
00:14:16.000 there are so many layers to the skin, and the skin is so thick on the elbow that there was staph    
00:14:20.880 bacteria beneath that first disinfected area. The needle pushed that into the joint capsule.   
00:14:26.249 Kevin Rose: Jesus.Tim Ferriss: And then within 48 hours,    
00:14:27.840 my elbow is the size of a volleyball. And I was chatting with a doctor friend of mine who this    
00:14:35.720 was probably 11:00 p.m. at night San Francisco —Kevin Rose: By the way, this is 12 years ago.   
00:14:39.640 Tim Ferriss: Something like that. 12 years ago.Kevin Rose: Remember I came and visited you    
00:14:41.800 in the hospital?Tim Ferriss: What    
00:14:42.680 was that? Oh, yeah, that's right.   
00:14:44.400 Kevin Rose: You squirted juice out of your arm.Tim Ferriss: Oh, that was gross.   
00:14:47.028 Kevin Rose: Yeah.Tim Ferriss: So a few things happened.    
00:14:48.400 Number one is my very competent doctor friend said, "Touch your elbow. Is it hot?" And I said,    
00:14:54.880 "Yes." And she said, "You need to go to the emergency room immediately. Here's the one    
00:14:58.480 you should go to. Tell them this." And I did. And a few hours later they're removing copious    
00:15:04.280 amounts of just disgusting monster fluid.Kevin Rose: Yeah. So I'm in the room, you    
00:15:08.560 hit me up and you're like, "I'm in the emergency room," or whatever, "I've got this infection,"    
00:15:11.920 or whatever. And I'm like, I should go check in on Tim. I go down there and I want to say,    
00:15:17.840 didn't some of it squirt against the wall?Tim Ferriss: There was a syringe    
00:15:20.720 full of all this disgusting juice.Kevin Rose: Yeah, because they're pulling it out.   
00:15:23.058 Tim Ferriss: And so I squirted it at you like a turkey baster.   
00:15:25.200 Kevin Rose: That's right. And I was like, "You fucker." Oh, Addison, thank you so much, sir.   
00:15:28.587 Tim Ferriss: Thank you very much.Kevin Rose: This looks amazing.   
00:15:30.587 Tim Ferriss: Oh, got it. Thank you.Kevin Rose: Thanks brother. Awesome.   
00:15:34.427 Tim Ferriss: What is it?Kevin Rose: What is this?   
00:15:36.711 Addison: Tequila martini.Kevin Rose: Tequila martini.   
00:15:38.319 Tim Ferriss: Tequila martini.Kevin Rose: Cheers.   
00:15:39.107 Tim Ferriss: Cheers. Cheers, brother.Kevin Rose: This is your    
00:15:40.560 tequila too that you invested in.Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. LALO tequila. Check    
00:15:42.920 it out. Only alcohol brand I've ever invested in.Kevin Rose: Thank you. So yeah, you squirted staph    
00:15:49.320 infection at me, you fucker.Tim Ferriss: I did.   
00:15:52.948 Kevin Rose: Which I'm like looking back at that, I'm like, that was a pretty dick thing to do.   
00:15:57.067 Tim Ferriss: Yeah.Kevin Rose: But we were laughing.   
00:15:58.227 Tim Ferriss: I wasn't getting in the eyes. I wasn't going    
00:15:59.560 to Phantom of the Opera you. But PRP —Kevin Rose: Damn, this is a good drink.   
00:16:03.267 Tim Ferriss: It is a great drink.Kevin Rose: Yeah.   
00:16:04.507 Tim Ferriss: So PRP, to be clear, number one, it's your own blood.   
00:16:08.068 Kevin Rose: Yes.Tim Ferriss: Number two,    
00:16:10.480 it can be, in some instances, really, really effective for orthopedic issues,    
00:16:15.800 but there's quite a bit of published literature so you can look it up. But I was unfamiliar with    
00:16:20.840 the applications to the vampire facial.Kevin Rose: So I go in, they draw about    
00:16:25.400 three vials of blood, they spin it, they come back with something that looks like    
00:16:29.080 grape juice in the vials, and then they take a microneedling kind of like, it almost looked    
00:16:35.600 like some type of automatic toothbrush or tattoo gun, almost. And then they go across your face,    
00:16:41.840 and they pepper all these little tiny microholes. And then they lather it with all the PRP. And then    
00:16:47.680 you go home and you're a little bruised up and stuff like that. And then a week later,    
00:16:52.360 some of the lines just start to get reduced.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I'm actually kind of    
00:16:56.040 shocked looking at your beautiful baby eyes.Kevin Rose: Thank you. They're going to do four    
00:16:59.680 of them in total. I had to get the package. You saved some money, you got like 20 percent off.    
00:17:03.400 It was a good package. So it's, for me, I'm like, dude, I'm fine getting old. If anyone's listening    
00:17:08.720 to this be like, oh, they're being too vain or whatever, I'm fine with that. I don't care if    
00:17:11.520 I get wrinkles and all that. That said, yeah, a couple more years of just looking okay doesn't    
00:17:16.640 hurt anybody. It's natural. It's my own shit.Tim Ferriss: Totally.   
00:17:20.708 Kevin Rose: I don't know. Helps with the dating life. Speaking of which.   
00:17:23.455 Tim Ferriss: Helps with the dating life. Helps with dating life. Yeah. Modern dating. We don't    
00:17:26.119 have to spend a lot of time on it.Kevin Rose: But a little bit    
00:17:27.599 though. What is it like on the other side?Tim Ferriss: What's it like on the other side?   
00:17:30.742 Kevin Rose: Yeah, you went to Paris.Tim Ferriss: Well, I went to Paris.   
00:17:34.108 Kevin Rose: How was that?Tim Ferriss: And actually,    
00:17:35.880 I want to give them a shout-out. I stayed at —Kevin Rose: To all the women in Paris.   
00:17:39.067 Tim Ferriss: No, not all the women in Paris. I went to an artist's commune effectively,    
00:17:43.560 or utopian community. They might not like this description.   
00:17:47.931 Kevin Rose: Den.Tim Ferriss: Well,    
00:17:48.480 it's an old chateau called Feÿtopia.Kevin Rose: Like in that Monty Python    
00:17:53.240 and the Holy Grail where that guy gets stuck in that, do you know what I'm talking about,    
00:17:55.373 where you get stuck in the castle? "We are all but 20 to 30-year-old women." Do you know what    
00:18:00.080 I'm talking about? He's stuck in there. Yeah.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. That was the hope. But it    
00:18:03.680 was a broader spectrum of participants. And I've really been making an effort.    
00:18:09.640 And I think there's a religious war afoot, which is, well, there are many religious wars, right?    
00:18:14.800 There's sleep training versus attachment-style parenting. People love factions and fighting.   
00:18:20.468 Kevin Rose: Yes.Tim Ferriss: Another one is,    
00:18:23.600 and I've been thinking about writing a blog post about this, let's just call it romance versus    
00:18:27.720 radical planning. So when I talk about some of the more systematic ways that I'm approaching dating,    
00:18:33.480 what some people will say is that's so unromantic to which I usually reply now, what    
00:18:38.600 does romantic mean? Walk me through what a week of taking a romantic approach would look like.   
00:18:43.588 Kevin Rose: Interesting.Tim Ferriss: Usually they don't have an answer.    
00:18:45.320 What they mean is serendipity like, et cetera.Kevin Rose: Exactly.   
00:18:48.507 Tim Ferriss: And I am providing space for that going to Paris or outside of    
00:18:53.320 Paris to something like Feÿtopia, which was an amazing experience. But I think also if you are,    
00:19:00.520 let's just say, I'll think this out loud, if you're in college or if you are in a company    
00:19:08.840 and you're right out of college, there's a lot of natural, inbuilt serendipity.   
00:19:13.130 Kevin Rose: Yeah.Tim Ferriss: Or if you live in    
00:19:13.640 a place like Manhattan.Kevin Rose: Yeah.   
00:19:15.147 Tim Ferriss: A lot of people are single around your age.   
00:19:17.228 Kevin Rose: Right, exactly. Around your age.Tim Ferriss: Around your age. You do social    
00:19:19.920 meetups all the time. You don't have things to do at night. You don't have kids yet.   
00:19:22.668 Kevin Rose: Exactly. Yeah.Tim Ferriss: So there's a lot of space    
00:19:25.240 for serendipity, let's just say you already have inbuilt 30, 50, 60 percent serendipity    
00:19:30.160 where if you want to meet literally 100 plus new people a month, it's very easy. As you get older,    
00:19:36.040 as your friends, all due respect, beautiful face aside, age out, basically. They're not going to be    
00:19:41.600 making introductions to maybe women who are in the age range I would be aiming for because I would    
00:19:47.880 like to have a few kids biologically.Kevin Rose: Yeah. So you're dipping    
00:19:49.800 down a little bit at this point.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. Right.   
00:19:52.120 Kevin Rose: 20s.Tim Ferriss: Look, sure, maybe in the 28 to 35    
00:19:59.520 range, somewhere in there.Kevin Rose: 36,    
00:20:01.000 you'd be like, all right, maybe.Tim Ferriss: I want somebody who's very ready,    
00:20:05.840 excited to build a family. Also has a good sense of their own identity, feels confident in being    
00:20:12.640 good at having developed skills or passions in certain areas. I want them to feel very happy    
00:20:21.400 with what they've done so they don't have, say, resentment later if you feel like they've given    
00:20:25.840 up everything as it was just getting started.Kevin Rose: It's a great point. So you want    
00:20:28.360 someone that's kind of like, they've probably even established a career at this point.    
00:20:31.880 That's what they've chosen to do. They're confident in who they are. They're like,    
00:20:36.080 okay, I'm mid-30s. I'm thinking about kids in the next couple of years. That kind of situation.   
00:20:40.787 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, exactly.Kevin Rose: Okay.   
00:20:41.787 Tim Ferriss: But I've realized, for instance, I've gone on a few dates with    
00:20:45.760 lawyers or doctors in those age ranges, they've been through so much schooling,    
00:20:51.000 they're just getting out of the gate and starting to get traction. So it's very hard, I think,    
00:20:56.200 for a woman in that position to think about having kids in the next three years, very hard, after so    
00:21:01.560 much investment in their education and career and so on. So it's been a learning process. I've met a    
00:21:07.680 lot of amazing people. I think that frankly, if I want to really double and triple down, I just have    
00:21:16.000 to spend a bunch of time in a few major cities.Kevin Rose: What's the biggest turnoff    
00:21:19.720 for you? When you sit down on a date and somebody says something or does something,    
00:21:24.520 your number one, this ain't going to work?Tim Ferriss: Well, there are a lot of little    
00:21:28.040 things, but I think most people would find these irritating. If someone's late repeatedly and they    
00:21:35.000 don't let you know until the time you're supposed to meet, that's just not being an adult. I want    
00:21:41.400 to be with an adult who is responsible. If we're going to build a family together,    
00:21:45.040 I need to know you have your shit together.Kevin Rose: Interesting. That's fair. I    
00:21:49.440 feel the same way. Even with a buddy, if I'm running five minutes late, I'm like,    
00:21:52.600 "Hey, right around the corner," blah, blah.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And if someone's repeatedly    
00:21:55.640 late, it means they probably haven't operated in higher stress situations or environments because    
00:22:03.800 you get punished for that. Right?Kevin Rose: Yeah.   
00:22:06.467 Tim Ferriss: It doesn't work. So that'd be one. And also I would say that for me,    
00:22:13.240 I'm looking for someone who is a compliment, not a duplicate. Tim Ferriss with long hair    
00:22:19.000 is my ultimate nightmare. I don't need to date that person. No. We'd kill each other.   
00:22:22.868 Kevin Rose: Yeah.Tim Ferriss: So that varies    
00:22:27.120 person to person. But for me, that means someone, let's just say you have a spectrum, like a slider    
00:22:33.840 in the middle. This is my working theory. It seems to hold up. So if you had a slider in the middle,    
00:22:39.600 you have, let's just call it perfect androgyny, and we won't stumble over the terms. If you want    
00:22:45.040 exact definitions, just choose your own. But let's just say it's perfect, 50/50 feminine    
00:22:49.200 masculine characteristics. And then as you move out in either direction, kind of about 100 percent    
00:22:53.680 masculine, 100 percent feminine, I think —Kevin Rose: Don't tell me you    
00:22:58.120 want 50/50. I think that's bullshit.Tim Ferriss: No, no, I don't want 50/50. What    
00:23:01.760 I've seen in couples that really, really work well is they to be equally distant from the center.   
00:23:07.308 Kevin Rose: Oh, interesting.Tim Ferriss: And by the way, that's not    
00:23:09.080 a gendered thing. You could have, for instance, I know couples where the male is really playful,    
00:23:15.280 A, B, and C, has characteristics that might be traditionally defined as feminine. Wife is like    
00:23:21.720 COO, runs the ship. That's fine.Kevin Rose: Yeah.   
00:23:25.147 Tim Ferriss: But they're equally distant from that center point. And    
00:23:28.880 that equivalent polarity seems to work.Kevin Rose: That is fascinating. Because    
00:23:34.320 I've had this conversation where I find that if you are so in the center and you're like 50/50    
00:23:41.360 and no one is stepping up to be either masculine or feminine in a traditional male female role that    
00:23:47.920 we're talking about here, obviously there's so many other ones out there, it's very confusing.   
00:23:52.547 Tim Ferriss: Yeah.Kevin Rose: Because you're like,    
00:23:53.520 "Well, either you do something or I need to do something." But it's like, what is this kind of    
00:23:58.920 boring middle? Do you see what I'm saying?Tim Ferriss: Yeah, totally. I think if you    
00:24:02.960 look at primates, you look at humans, it's like, we like to know where we stand or what    
00:24:09.840 we're supposed to do. What is our job? And so I think that can take a lot of different    
00:24:14.880 forms. Energetically. Let's take gender out of it. Even within a company, if it's a pure flat    
00:24:21.840 meritocracy, no job titles, if things get amorphous, it's going to be very confusing.   
00:24:27.388 Kevin Rose: 100 percent.Tim Ferriss: So I do think    
00:24:28.680 there's a comfort that can come that is hard to put words to with matched polarity,    
00:24:36.600 which again, is not a gendered thing. It's more like a constellation of characteristics.  
00:24:40.747 Tim Ferriss: Should we shift gears a little bit?Kevin Rose: Yeah, let's do it.   
00:24:42.907 Tim Ferriss: Thank God. Get me off the hot seat.Kevin Rose: Yeah. I was just going to ask    
00:24:45.120 how the Paris dating scene was.Tim Ferriss: So I want to make a    
00:24:48.760 couple of recommendations.Kevin Rose: Yes,    
00:24:49.960 please. Then I got something to show you.Tim Ferriss: Do you know who Bobby Fingers is?   
00:24:52.468 Kevin Rose: Sounds familiar.Tim Ferriss: Always a safe thing to    
00:24:55.960 say. "I think I've heard of him."Kevin Rose: Yeah.   
00:24:58.320 Tim Ferriss: Tell me more. So Bobby Fingers is one of my favorite discoveries on YouTube    
00:25:04.240 of the last decade. And he is one of the most unbelievably skilled artists,    
00:25:13.680 craftsmen, sculptor, polymaths. Is also hilarious, and his writing is incredible,    
00:25:21.693 is a performer and makes the most bizarre shit you've ever seen in your life. So    
00:25:25.920 they're 10- to 30-minute-long descriptions of him making something beautiful and then hiding    
00:25:34.000 it by burying it somewhere. And there's one of the, let's say, the scene with Michael Jackson    
00:25:39.600 where his hair catches on fire and it's some building this entire diorama. There's one of    
00:25:43.360 the Mel Gibson DUI stop way back in the day. And I would say that if you want to see something    
00:25:53.480 that I think is pure genius —Kevin Rose: So is this a    
00:25:55.200 video or what is this exactly?Tim Ferriss: It is, yeah, it's a    
00:25:56.800 video channel. So if you go to Bobby Fingers at Bobby Fingers on YouTube, you can find them on    
00:26:02.280 Patreon as well, patreon.com/bobbyfingers. Youtube.com/@bobbyfingers. And this guy    
00:26:10.400 should have, in my opinion, hundreds of millions of views.   
00:26:12.988 Kevin Rose: What's he at now? Is it big?Tim Ferriss: For what he's doing,    
00:26:16.120 I think it is so hard to categorize that it hasn't had as much spread as it deserves.   
00:26:22.788 Kevin Rose: 195,000 followers, still decent.Tim Ferriss: Oh, he is doing well.   
00:26:25.610 Kevin Rose: Yeah.Tim Ferriss: But I really feel a moral,    
00:26:29.120 maybe a moral/immoral obligation to recommend people go check this out.   
00:26:33.272 Kevin Rose: Oh, this looks amazing.Tim Ferriss: There will be plenty to offend    
00:26:34.560 everyone, but it is so genius and unlike anything I've ever seen in my life, I strongly recommend    
00:26:40.280 people check it out. And two of my favorites, there are many good ones, but I would say Michael    
00:26:45.400 Jackson or Mel Gibson are a great place to start.Kevin Rose: That's awesome. All right. I'll    
00:26:48.960 check that out. By the way, were you doing Ozempic in this shot?   
00:26:51.520 Tim Ferriss: Oh, wow. Look at that. I'm so glad AI shaved my chest for me too.   
00:26:56.930 Kevin Rose: Yeah.Tim Ferriss: I'm looking good.   
00:26:58.028 Kevin Rose: Dude, that is a legit —Tim Ferriss: Yeah.   
00:27:00.640 Kevin Rose: If you were 007.Tim Ferriss: Honestly, what's    
00:27:03.400 crazy to me about that —Kevin Rose: Is how much    
00:27:05.280 you actually look like that.Tim Ferriss: How great I look in those    
00:27:08.720 Speedos. But separately is the lighting.Kevin Rose: Yeah.   
00:27:13.467 Tim Ferriss: It looks real. That's really —Kevin Rose: Makes you want to go back to the gym.   
00:27:18.320 Tim Ferriss: Why go to the gym when I can just put that up?   
00:27:20.262 Kevin Rose: Yeah, exactly.Tim Ferriss: Actually, I've been    
00:27:21.280 training. I've been training very hard recently and feeling very good. I'm not taking Ozempic,    
00:27:27.040 but I have been using a few different tools that I thought people might find interesting.   
00:27:32.478 Kevin Rose: Yeah, let's hear.Tim Ferriss: So one which was    
00:27:33.440 recommended to me by a two time silver medalist in Olympic archery, Jake Kaminski. I would also    
00:27:40.960 recommend people check out his channel if you want to learn anything about archery,    
00:27:46.120 especially recurve. He is amazing, both as a performer, proven performer, but as a teacher.    
00:27:52.640 So Jake Kaminski with a bunch of Is, Kaminski, he recommended the Outdoorsmans Atlas Trainer Frame    
00:27:59.720 System. So what is this? I'll tell you the problem it solves. So I own a bunch of rucking sacks.    
00:28:05.200 So these are backpacks with weights in them.And there are a few issues with the sets that    
00:28:11.720 I've owned to date. One is that they're usually a set weight. You can swap out these huge square    
00:28:17.440 plates. Secondly, they don't necessarily have a waist or kidney belt. So the weight is on your    
00:28:23.880 shoulders and not also share it on your hips. And this particular system is effectively a    
00:28:31.680 frame hiking backpack that's very well constructed and it has plate loading on your back. So you can    
00:28:38.280 put Olympic plates on it. So any weight plates you might have in a gym or that you might buy at    
00:28:43.520 Dick's Sporting Goods or whatever that you could use for barbell, you can slap onto this thing.   
00:28:48.904 Kevin Rose: Oh, that's amazing.Tim Ferriss: So you can adjust it amazing    
00:28:51.520 increments and then use progressive resistance.Kevin Rose: And do you want more weight on your    
00:28:56.400 hips? Don't get me wrong, obviously long-term, 50-mile hikes or whatever you want to get the    
00:29:01.200 weight onto the hips. I got my DEXA scan done, which I'm sure you've done before.    
00:29:05.280 Low radiation calculates all different types of muscle and fat types and bone density. My    
00:29:10.680 bone density is going down.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, me too.   
00:29:12.744 Kevin Rose: And one of the things that Attia told me and his staff was — rucking. Get weight on the    
00:29:19.240 bones so that you can maintain that bone density.Tim Ferriss: Yep.   
00:29:24.388 Kevin Rose: Why throw it on the hips? Why not leave it on the shoulders?   
00:29:26.627 Tim Ferriss: All right, so there are a few reasons for that. The first is — and we've    
00:29:28.800 talked about this a lot on this show and offline too — I've had — it's improved dramatically — but    
00:29:34.520 for the last two years, I've been plagued by incredibly painful chronic low back pain.   
00:29:39.228 Kevin Rose: You've had back issues for a long time, dude.   
00:29:41.507 Tim Ferriss: Especially the last two years to the point where there have been moments,    
00:29:44.520 say a year, a year and a half ago, where I couldn't stand or sit for more than five minutes.   
00:29:48.148 Kevin Rose: Oh, geez.Tim Ferriss: And —   
00:29:48.788 Kevin Rose: Oh, that's right. You were carrying around that little ball or something that you put    
00:29:51.440 behind your back. Wasn't there something you had?Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I still have that for really    
00:29:54.680 uncomfortable seats if I have to be on say a plane for a few hours or something    
00:29:57.480 like that. I use a little Pilates ball, which you can fold up and stick in your    
00:30:00.200 pocket. It's actually great for lumbar support.But the point is, I am specifically training for    
00:30:06.920 a hunt that I have at the end of this month. I do not hunt often. The first hunt I ever did was    
00:30:12.200 for The 4-Hour Chef long ago. That was 2012, but I would've done it probably 2010 or 2011.    
00:30:18.800 And I just feel very good about sourcing ethical clean meat with wild harvesting. And in this case,    
00:30:26.920 it's an elk hunt. I've done exclusively bow for probably close to 10 years now, but part of that —   
00:30:32.468 Kevin Rose: Well, some of the endangered species stuff you    
00:30:34.000 do though. I just — for some reason, I just —Tim Ferriss: I know. I don't know why you sent    
00:30:37.800 back my snow leopard pancakes.Kevin Rose: Yeah, exactly.   
00:30:39.820 Tim Ferriss: No, in this case, you do it the right way. You get tags. Everything is wildlife    
00:30:43.960 management, but if you're going to do that, you're going to be at high altitude. You're going to be,    
00:30:48.720 in this case, it's called bivy hunting. I'm going to be carrying everything. How do you    
00:30:52.120 have so many flies in one pristine —Kevin Rose: It's southern California.   
00:30:55.623 Tim Ferriss: — recording studio. In any case —Kevin Rose: It likes you.   
00:30:59.307 Tim Ferriss: I know. I love you too, fly. So you're going to be carrying basically your camp    
00:31:05.320 with you every day, and that's probably going to be between 9,000 and 12,000 feet above sea level.    
00:31:11.320 And then if you harvest an animal, you're going to be field dressing it, breaking it down into pieces    
00:31:15.240 and you might be carrying an additional 50 pounds. You don't want all that on your shoulders. That    
00:31:19.320 would also be a very bad idea for me — not that you would do it anyway in that circumstance — to    
00:31:23.320 load that on my shoulders, which would place a lot of that on my lower back, which is compromised.    
00:31:28.560 I have some pathological issues with my low back and my SI joint. So I shift a lot of it to the    
00:31:34.520 hips. You are taking some of it on the shoulders.Kevin Rose: You don't have any meat    
00:31:38.360 sherpas or anything that go with you?Tim Ferriss: I think we might have one or    
00:31:42.000 two people who are there just to be part of the trip and might help with carrying, but you have    
00:31:45.800 to keep in mind, if you take down a larger bull elk, you might have hundreds of pounds of meat.   
00:31:52.828 Kevin Rose: How do you keep that meat fresh?Tim Ferriss: There are a number of different —   
00:31:55.690 Kevin Rose: Salt?Tim Ferriss: No. A number of different    
00:31:56.560 ways you might approach it. Given the time of year and the elevation, it's going to get pretty cold.    
00:32:02.840 So a lot of folks first would hang the meat as they're deconstructing the animal in the field and    
00:32:11.400 let it cool down. Then you put it into meat bags, which look like big socks effectively. And then    
00:32:17.880 how they're going to actually protect that at camp or how they'll place it, et cetera, remains to be    
00:32:23.200 seen. I am always going out with people who are effectively professional outdoorsmen. I'm always    
00:32:29.640 the slow fat kid. Always. So part of the reason I'm training my ass off is to not completely    
00:32:35.760 embarrass the person who invited me.Kevin Rose: That's going to    
00:32:38.560 be awesome though. That sounds fun.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it's great. So I'm doing    
00:32:40.440 a lot of rucking. Also doing a lot of training on activating, say glute medius, piriformis, hip,    
00:32:49.680 internal and external rotators. And the more I do that, the less the obliques and other muscles turn    
00:32:56.680 on to compensate and stabilize the low back and the less low back pain I have. So that's    
00:33:01.120 been another big breakthrough in terms of the low back issues. But honestly, if you do some rucking,    
00:33:07.640 maybe some kettlebell swings once or twice a week, some push-ups and some core work,    
00:33:14.080 you're done. You're really hitting everything.Kevin Rose: Yeah. I love rucking. Rucking has    
00:33:17.720 been kind of my three to five days a week, four miles each time with elevation. And it's just    
00:33:23.240 like — you just — in an hour and a half —Addison: Corner.   
00:33:25.154 Kevin Rose: Oh, we got a new corner. We've got —Tim Ferriss: Refill. Coming in hot.   
00:33:29.028 Kevin Rose: What is this?Addison: Okay, sorry. I know you like tequila    
00:33:31.800 but I want to pause. This is called Fairbanks.Kevin Rose: Fairbanks. What's in it?   
00:33:38.751 Addison: Apricot liqueur.Kevin Rose: Oh, this is one    
00:33:39.433 of your favorites. I know this one.Addison: Yeah. This is one of my    
00:33:39.501 favorites. Bitters and rye whiskey.Kevin Rose: Rye, apricot, liqueur and — thank    
00:33:40.200 you, Addison. I appreciate that.   
00:33:40.796 Tim Ferriss: Bitters and rye whiskey.Addison: I didn't have other    
00:33:41.301 glasses and stuff so I —Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah. Appreciate that. Cheers.   
00:33:41.374 Addison: Oh, my god. Do you smell this stuff?Kevin Rose: Exactly. Tim has to board    
00:33:41.960 a flight after this —Tim Ferriss: Here we go.   
00:33:44.551 Addison: Fireball shots.Kevin Rose: Yeah, Fireball shots.   
00:33:46.267 Tim Ferriss: Cheers, Kevin.Kevin Rose: Cheers.   
00:33:48.140 Addison: I want to watch the reaction.Kevin Rose: There we go.   
00:33:50.547 Tim Ferriss: Reaction shot.Kevin Rose: This is one of    
00:33:53.080 his favorite drinks to make.Tim Ferriss: That's really nice.   
00:33:55.700 Addison: I know you said not too sweet. I try to —Tim Ferriss: It's not too sweet.   
00:33:59.388 Kevin Rose: Isn't that good?Tim Ferriss: And it has the fancy ice cubes too.   
00:34:01.240 Addison: Spirit forward, for sure too.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Spirit forward.    
00:34:03.880 That's in my dating bio.Kevin Rose: Exactly. So with    
00:34:09.560 Paris — hold on. Just tell me what they look like because they've got    
00:34:13.199 a good fashion sense out there.Tim Ferriss: Well, part of what    
00:34:15.320 I was interested to see — I spent almost eight weeks in Europe was, how does dating    
00:34:20.040 differ in different places in Europe?Kevin Rose: They're a little softer    
00:34:22.000 out there though. You like that.Tim Ferriss: Not necessarily. Not necessarily.   
00:34:24.447 Kevin Rose: Really?Tim Ferriss: No. So it varies    
00:34:25.880 tremendously by country, I would say. And of course there's a huge range within each country,    
00:34:29.360 but say in — dating in France is very different from dating in Madrid, which is very different    
00:34:35.520 from dating in other places. It really varies tremendously, but part of what I'm hoping for is    
00:34:43.440 finding someone, and these women exist, but a lot of women, understandably from a million reasons,    
00:34:50.080 feel very conflicted and are put in I think a difficult position frankly when thinking about    
00:34:54.960 career, kids. Basically trying to do more than any person in history had to do before 50 years ago.   
00:35:04.108 Kevin Rose: All right, let's not go by the back end into this. We can —   
00:35:05.627 Tim Ferriss: No, I'm just saying —Kevin Rose: No, I hear what you're saying though.   
00:35:07.387 Tim Ferriss: It's very challenging. But what I want to get a real clear signal on is that    
00:35:11.440 somebody is excited to be a mom in the same way that I'm excited to be a dad and that it's not,    
00:35:17.080 well all my friends are getting married. I guess this is what you do. Even though I'm    
00:35:20.600 going to make all these compromises and might resent it later. I don't want to subject a kid    
00:35:26.000 to that potential risk, right?Kevin Rose: It's wise of you.   
00:35:30.107 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So that's what I'm looking for, but there isn't some Garden of Eden where you    
00:35:35.320 magically just walk down Whole Foods and pick up a woman like that. But there are some significant    
00:35:41.680 cultural differences from place to place.Kevin Rose: Yeah.   
00:35:43.904 Tim Ferriss: All right. Yeah, let's move on.Kevin Rose: All right, so I have a gift for you.   
00:35:45.507 Tim Ferriss: I have a gift? How kind of you. Oh, wow.   
00:35:47.868 Kevin Rose: This is called a Feno. This is my buddy's new startup.   
00:35:51.501 Tim Ferriss: Thank you.Kevin Rose: And in the    
00:35:53.800 self-experimenting kind of crazy vein of things, I want to show you this. Now, Feno. F-E-N-O.   
00:35:58.987 Tim Ferriss: Yeah.Kevin Rose: So this is — okay, this is a beta.    
00:36:01.960 Okay, so you can't laugh at me because remember you're going to be doing this by yourself, okay?   
00:36:05.687 Tim Ferriss: Oh, god.Kevin Rose: This is not like a    
00:36:06.280 Fleshlight or anything. Okay.Tim Ferriss: What the fuck?   
00:36:10.588 Kevin Rose: So this is a medically proven way to brush your entire mouth in 20 seconds.   
00:36:16.907 Tim Ferriss: Wow. Okay. That's interesting.Kevin Rose: So watch this.   
00:36:19.867 Tim Ferriss: Wow, you're going to try it?Kevin Rose: Yeah, I'm going to take a look    
00:36:21.240 at this here. You put those foam in here and so they have this little app that custom creates a    
00:36:26.920 mold. I estimated your mouth size.Tim Ferriss: You didn't buy this    
00:36:28.160 from an ad on PornHub?Kevin Rose: So this is    
00:36:33.760 going to look a little mouth aggressive. Okay? So if you're watching the video —   
00:36:41.267 Tim Ferriss: Spirit forward, mouth aggressive. That's also my bio.   
00:36:44.348 Kevin Rose: Exactly. So what you do is that this was created by a couple of founders    
00:36:49.160 that obviously one of them was a dentist and they figured out that compliance is really    
00:36:54.040 hard with — people say — everyone says they floss. They don't. I do, but do you floss?   
00:36:59.027 Tim Ferriss: Oh, seven times a day.Kevin Rose: So check this out. I put this in my    
00:37:03.240 mouth and this is going to wrap around both sides.Tim Ferriss: How are you going to rinse that?   
00:37:06.828 Kevin Rose: I don't know.Tim Ferriss: All right, let's see it.    
00:37:07.800 Let's see it. This is going to be good.Kevin Rose: I couldn't stop it.   
00:37:31.707 Tim Ferriss: Holy shit.Kevin Rose: I know what you're thinking.   
00:37:35.067 Tim Ferriss: You definitely bought that on PornHub.   
00:37:37.600 Kevin Rose: No, I did not, but it works surprisingly well.   
00:37:41.787 Tim Ferriss: I'll try it.Kevin Rose: I got one for you.   
00:37:44.365 Tim Ferriss: Thank you.Kevin Rose: I've got to say that I do    
00:37:45.880 love — it has sensors in there. I know, I know.Tim Ferriss: I bet it does.   
00:37:49.948 Kevin Rose: You're doing it by yourself so you don't look like you're getting    
00:37:52.120 mouth-raped every time.Tim Ferriss: I can see you    
00:37:53.520 winking. I can see you winking.Kevin Rose: It is it aggressive,    
00:37:57.160 but I will say that —Tim Ferriss: Aggressive.   
00:37:59.840 Kevin Rose: — it does a very good job cleaning.Tim Ferriss: Aggressive but effective.   
00:38:02.908 Kevin Rose: Aggressive but effective. And it is 20 seconds, which is great. They have sensors    
00:38:06.760 that actually scan your gums and look at gum health and can send it back to your doctor.   
00:38:10.667 Tim Ferriss: What? On that device?Kevin Rose: On the device, built into the device.    
00:38:13.640 So that your doctor can actually see recession and things that are happening with your gums.    
00:38:17.200 So it's a very tech forward device. It's crazy.Tim Ferriss: You know, I had my — my first real    
00:38:20.800 surgery was when I was a kid for receding gingiva. I actually had a huge piece of my    
00:38:27.600 upper — well, I guess it's your only — palate    
00:38:29.760 removed and grafted —Kevin Rose: Holy shit.   
00:38:31.663 Tim Ferriss: — onto my lower gums.Kevin Rose: From sugar and shit?    
00:38:33.680 What were you doing?Tim Ferriss: No, no. It    
00:38:34.440 was just genetic. My gums were receding when I was a kid. I don't know how old I was. Maybe 12,    
00:38:39.280 something like that. It was brutal.Kevin Rose: That's the first time I've    
00:38:42.080 ever done that. That was —Tim Ferriss: Oh.   
00:38:43.184 Kevin Rose: — vigorous.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it's a —   
00:38:46.948 Kevin Rose: I'm so —Tim Ferriss: It stretched.   
00:38:48.384 Kevin Rose: — upset that I did not video that from this direction.   
00:38:50.507 Tim Ferriss: We've got —Kevin Rose:    
00:38:51.080 Go here. We've got that camera right there.Tim Ferriss: Oh, that's the slow-mo. We need    
00:38:54.440 that in slow-mo. The intro to the episode.Kevin Rose: Listen, hey, you know what's    
00:38:59.960 funny is when I was putting together these stories for The Random Show, I'm like,    
00:39:02.840 I love — if you look back historically at all the years we've been doing this episode,    
00:39:07.360 we've had some of the most craziest, stupidest shit and talked about the dumbest stuff. I mean,    
00:39:11.640 we already today talked about you squirting your freaking infectious fluid at my body.   
00:39:16.922 Tim Ferriss: That's true. That's true.Kevin Rose: We've done some weird shit    
00:39:18.120 and so I always try to find stuff. I mean, this is both cool and —   
00:39:21.947 Tim Ferriss: Every once in a while, one of those things. Five years later,    
00:39:24.680 look at that. It's everywhere.Kevin Rose: Exactly.   
00:39:26.370 Tim Ferriss: Yeah.Kevin Rose: Exactly. Remember dude,    
00:39:27.400 I talked about Ethereum for the first time on this show, before it launched.   
00:39:30.378 Tim Ferriss: You did. When was that? That was — God, that was a long time ago. That was when I was    
00:39:34.200 still living in my first place in San Francisco.Kevin Rose: I watched the clip and I'm like, "Oh,    
00:39:37.520 there's this one cryptocurrency. Usually [inaudible]" And you're like, "No, no,    
00:39:40.120 no. Tell me, tell me." And I'm like, "Well it hasn't launched yet." And you're like, "What is    
00:39:42.280 it?" I'm like, "Well, it's called Ethereum."Tim Ferriss: When was that? That    
00:39:44.400 was like 20 — it had to be —Kevin Rose: I have to go back and look.   
00:39:47.901 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 2014 or something. I mean, it was way back then. It was way back in the day. I    
00:39:51.640 remember exactly where we were sitting by the fireplace in my first rental in San Francisco.   
00:39:56.028 Kevin Rose: It was a cool spot.Tim Ferriss: Yeah.   
00:39:57.320 Kevin Rose: All right, your turn. What do you got?Tim Ferriss: My turn? Well, let's see. I would say    
00:40:02.320 that I can't say too much about it. You're going to hate that. We never asked what your book was    
00:40:06.960 about. But anyway, I can't really —Kevin Rose: So I know you    
00:40:10.000 never talk about that shit.Tim Ferriss: I'll talk about a    
00:40:10.680 superstition that may actually have something to it. So I, as well as a handful of other authors    
00:40:15.960 I know really well who've written a lot of books, feel like there is such a thing as,    
00:40:22.680 let's call it mimetic release. And what I mean by that is I think it's fairly frequently observed    
00:40:33.960 that you'll have some, as an example, intractable scientific problem or some scientific problem that    
00:40:40.200 researchers around the world are grappling with, and there's almost no apparent major progress made    
00:40:47.840 for years and years and years, and then within the same two-week period, people in all these    
00:40:51.480 different locations suddenly make breakthroughs. What is happening there? And what I have observed,    
00:40:57.840 and again, this is getting into maybe what people would consider magical thinking,    
00:41:01.760 but I can't explain it. It doesn't mean there isn't an explanation. When    
00:41:05.400 people talk about ideas, that idea seems to suddenly pop up in a lot of other places.   
00:41:10.560 Now you could make the argument that that's maybe expectancy bias.    
00:41:14.320 If you buy a Hyundai — It's a red Hyundai —Kevin Rose: Then all you see red Hyundais.   
00:41:17.423 Tim Ferriss: — all you see is red Hyundais, right?Kevin Rose: Yeah.   
00:41:18.667 Tim Ferriss: So there could be an element of that, but there seems to be more to it, which is part of    
00:41:22.880 the reason why I don't talk about the key core concepts in a book before I release something.   
00:41:31.600 But I will say in terms of progress, in case anybody's wondering,    
00:41:34.720 have probably five to 600 pages drafted.Kevin Rose: Oh, shit, it's a big book.   
00:41:38.387 Tim Ferriss: Got a lot. Yeah, I mean all my books are phone books and that    
00:41:41.200 is going to get cut down, probably. Well, actually, it's probably going to get to    
00:41:44.080 800 and then it'll get cut down to 500 or 400.Kevin Rose: Did you use any AI in crafting this?   
00:41:50.507 Tim Ferriss: I did not.Kevin Rose: Nothing?   
00:41:51.800 Tim Ferriss: Not yet.Kevin Rose: Okay.   
00:41:53.327 Tim Ferriss: Not yet.Kevin Rose: Will you apply    
00:41:53.960 that to some of the chapters?Tim Ferriss: I might apply it    
00:41:57.720 in combination with test readers looking for gaps in the material. Basically use AI as a critic and    
00:42:05.920 try to find gaps that would be ultimately helpful to mainstream for a larger audience    
00:42:13.160 of readers. I could see using it that way.Kevin Rose: I did a really cool thing the    
00:42:16.080 other day where I created a custom ChatGPT and I uploaded — I went back    
00:42:21.920 and I looked at every single book that Warren Buffett had ever recommended,    
00:42:28.120 The Intelligent Investor, all these. And I found the PDFs from them all because you    
00:42:32.480 can just Google them and they're there. And I uploaded them all to the ChatGPT and I said,    
00:42:37.120 "You're my investment advisor. What should I do in this particular situation?" And I'm    
00:42:41.640 asking questions of this custom saved ChatGPT based on all of Buffett's    
00:42:45.440 favorite books. It's freaking fascinating, dude.Tim Ferriss: You know, what you could probably    
00:42:48.440 also do is take all of his annual letters.Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah, a hundred percent. I    
00:42:51.520 have that. There's a book about his annual letters that I uploaded into it.   
00:42:54.175 Tim Ferriss: [inaudible] the green cover.Kevin Rose: Yeah, they're in there.   
00:42:55.460 Tim Ferriss: That is so cool. So what happened?Kevin Rose: Well, I just got    
00:42:59.240 some insights. I was asking —Tim Ferriss: "Buy low, sell high."   
00:43:02.680 Kevin Rose: It turns out "Index funds" is all it says back to me. It's like, "You idiot. Stop."   
00:43:07.907 Tim Ferriss: "Don't outsmart yourself."Kevin Rose: Yeah, but I mean there's very specific    
00:43:10.760 questions you have around timing of markets or not that — I didn't ask that particular question,    
00:43:15.840 but things around the markets where you're like, okay, how do you feel about our current state when    
00:43:22.400 we think the Fed is going to cut rates over the next 12 months? What do you think about bonds?    
00:43:26.960 Blah, blah, blah. And it just spits back very intelligent responses based on the historic data,    
00:43:31.320 which I find is just — I mean. That is so cool.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it's amazing.   
00:43:35.588 Kevin Rose: It's really cool. Anyway, I'm excited for your book. When will it launch though? When    
00:43:39.320 are we talking? I mean, you're 500, 600 pages in.Tim Ferriss: So I've been thinking about a    
00:43:43.960 few different options. One is doing it the way that I've done it in the past,    
00:43:48.400 which is to release it all at once as a book launch. There will definitely be some new    
00:43:54.920 experimental wrinkles to that no matter what.Kevin Rose: Traditional publisher? Because    
00:43:58.280 before you did Amazon once. You did —Tim Ferriss: Well, I did Amazon Publishing,    
00:44:02.000 which at that time you could consider a traditional publisher. So in structure it    
00:44:06.000 was very similar. They just had the distribution advantage being Amazon. This time around, we'll    
00:44:11.240 see. I mean, I could very easily see doing ebook audio on my own or through an Amazon platform.   
00:44:19.283 Kevin Rose: Interesting.Tim Ferriss: And then possibly doing a print-only    
00:44:20.920 deal or doing print-on-demand, frankly. The quality of print-on-demand has improved so much.   
00:44:26.228 Kevin Rose: It's insane. Yeah.Tim Ferriss: It's absolutely perfectly sufficient.   
00:44:28.988 Kevin Rose: Dude, I was at Ryan Holiday's — I went to his bookstore outside of    
00:44:32.800 Austin, which is amazing.Tim Ferriss: Painted Porch.    
00:44:34.520 It's a great bookstore.Kevin Rose: He has the best    
00:44:36.200 bookstore. What a life. I love him. He's such a good dude. I went to his bookstore    
00:44:40.120 and — beautiful — it's such a beautifully curated art project that is driven by him.   
00:44:46.627 Tim Ferriss: Yes.Kevin Rose: If you want    
00:44:47.240 to see sort of a new manifestation of the best of old school bookstores, visit Painted Porch.   
00:44:54.760 And it's about a half hour to 40 minute drive outside of Austin. He's got cats walking around    
00:44:59.680 there. It's all of his favorite books.Tim Ferriss: He even has cats.   
00:45:03.348 Kevin Rose: Yeah, they're even cats for the cat lovers. But the thing I would    
00:45:06.680 say that was really cool is that he actually had his books printed,    
00:45:09.680 like higher-end versions of his books, leather-bound, super high-end versions that    
00:45:14.480 he had done that were just insane quality.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they're beautiful.   
00:45:18.200 Kevin Rose: And those are kind of as you need them, kind of like on-demand. It's amazing.   
00:45:21.760 Tim Ferriss: A bit of a trivia for folks. Well, I'll give trivia on trivia. So trivia,    
00:45:26.120 "tri via" wreath three roads. It's actually these little tchotchkes that travelers would put down    
00:45:31.440 for good luck on their path at intersections of paths. That's where trivia comes from. But    
00:45:36.920 separately, The Painted Porch refers to Stoicism, which comes from the Greek stoa because early    
00:45:47.160 iterations of the philosophical tenets of Stoicism were taught in this open-air porched area. So that    
00:45:56.560 is why his book store is called The Painted Porch.Kevin Rose: That's amazing.   
00:45:58.850 Tim Ferriss: Yeah.Kevin Rose: Yeah, we've got 14-year-old    
00:46:00.200 Toaster, almost 14 here, coming to visit us.Tim Ferriss: You're saying he's totally deaf,    
00:46:03.680 but he still remembers me. Came up, licked my face.   
00:46:05.960 Kevin Rose: He did. He's done courses of rapamycin.   
00:46:08.200 Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah?Kevin Rose: Yeah. So I put    
00:46:10.360 him on it a few years ago.Tim Ferriss: And?   
00:46:12.548 Kevin Rose: And it seems to be working. I mean, dude, you see him. He's moving    
00:46:15.000 around great. And he's almost 14.Tim Ferriss: I know. This brings back so    
00:46:17.760 many memories. I mean, back way, way back in the day. I'm looking at Darya. Hi, Darya. I remember    
00:46:24.800 recording on your couch. This was back still in Digg days and Toaster was a little pupper and he    
00:46:31.760 was chewing on the XLR cable and almost killed our podcast and killed himself. And here he is,    
00:46:37.680 all these years later, wagging his tail.Kevin Rose: Yeah, I caught him halfway through    
00:46:41.440 one time, an actual full voltage cable out of the wall and it was just — yeah, it was horrible.   
00:46:48.040 Tim Ferriss: So rapamycin, we've probably talked about it before,    
00:46:50.440 but people can check out — I'm not sure what this current status is, but The Dog Aging Project,    
00:46:54.320 I did a podcast with Matt Kaeberlein.Kevin Rose: Yeah. University of    
00:46:56.880 Washington. You and I both —Tim Ferriss: Supported that.   
00:46:58.664 Kevin Rose: — supported that, funding-wise to fund that and power that study.   
00:47:01.947 Tim Ferriss: Yep.Kevin Rose: Yeah. So did    
00:47:02.880 Peter Attia. Yeah, so did Brian —Tim Ferriss: Armstrong.   
00:47:06.184 Kevin Rose: — Armstrong from Coinbase. We all kind of chipped in to see what would happen.   
00:47:09.467 Tim Ferriss: Really, really, really fascinating work. So people who are interested in rapamycin    
00:47:14.080 for potential longevity applications can take a look at that. And I did an interview separately    
00:47:18.720 with Matt Kaeberlein, which I really, really enjoyed. What else do you have?   
00:47:21.708 Kevin Rose: I have one quick update. One just for people to check out. So original of Henry    
00:47:26.440 Shukman's new book, who is my Zen master. Got to give him a plug. He's such an awesome human.   
00:47:30.740 Tim Ferriss: He's a great guy.Kevin Rose: And his app, The Way, fantastic    
00:47:33.360 meditation app. You and I are both investors in. I always want to give Henry some love because he's    
00:47:37.280 such a good soul. The book is fantastic.Tim Ferriss: You did some — that's    
00:47:40.800 called Original Love.Kevin Rose: Original Love, yeah.   
00:47:42.627 Tim Ferriss: All right. You did some training recently and you sent me the schedule,    
00:47:47.160 the daily schedule. What did your daily schedule look like and how long did it last?   
00:47:50.628 Kevin Rose: So I went to a five-day silent meditation retreat with his master,    
00:47:56.120 who is the head of the Zen sect out of Japan, flew in for this into Santa Fe, New Mexico. And    
00:48:01.760 so I will tell you, when you sit with Henry and you do — I've done a seven-day silent retreat    
00:48:06.720 with him in the past. If it's just Mountain Cloud Zen Center, which is his Zen center,    
00:48:11.520 it's probably four hours of sitting a day. And then there's walking meditation and a    
00:48:15.920 stretching thing. When the Zen master's there, when the guy from Japan's there, it's legit.   
00:48:22.147 Tim Ferriss: Like Hell week.Kevin Rose: It's Hell week for    
00:48:24.040 meditation. So I was up at 5:00 a.m. every morning and I didn't get to bed until probably — released    
00:48:29.120 at 8:30 and I was sitting for most of the day.Tim Ferriss: So one thing I wanted to ask you    
00:48:32.800 about — because I saw it in there. There's a lot of sitting meditation. I'm like, okay,    
00:48:37.080 that sounds uncomfortable, doing that for eight hours a day, which I tried once. People who    
00:48:41.120 want to read about my complete implosion —Kevin Rose: You were also doing mushrooms    
00:48:44.240 at the same time.Tim Ferriss: And fasting for six days. Yeah,    
00:48:46.000 people want to read about my self-inflicted implosion, that's in a separate interview,    
00:48:50.120 but the chanting before mealtime?Kevin Rose: Yeah.   
00:48:54.747 Tim Ferriss: What's the story here?Kevin Rose: In Zen, traditional monasteries    
00:48:58.640 and whatnot where they have actual monks, there is a lot of — it is only 10 minutes.   
00:49:03.240 It's just kind of reciting.Tim Ferriss: Only. Try    
00:49:04.920 chanting for 10 minutes. Tell me it's only.Kevin Rose: No, but it's just reciting a lot    
00:49:08.280 of the precepts and a lot of core beliefs.Tim Ferriss: In English? Japanese?   
00:49:11.788 Kevin Rose: Yeah. Sometimes it's in Japanese, sometimes it's in English,    
00:49:13.560 depending on who's running it.Tim Ferriss: Do you have a little    
00:49:16.240 psalm book that you read from?Kevin Rose: Yes. When it's    
00:49:18.240 in Japanese, a hundred percent.Yeah. I don't even know what I'm saying.    
00:49:20.960 I could be like, "Large Donkey Kong."Tim Ferriss: McDonald's donkey cock.   
00:49:25.410 Kevin Rose: Yeah.Tim Ferriss: Garbage bag. Triceratops.   
00:49:28.548 Kevin Rose: I don't know what to say, but it's quite nice. It's just a way to kind of endcap a    
00:49:33.480 set and then move into the next thing.Tim Ferriss: Must feel so good after    
00:49:36.800 being totally silent —Kevin Rose: Oh, my God.   
00:49:38.863 Tim Ferriss: — just to hear some voices.Kevin Rose: I know. I went out afterwards    
00:49:42.600 because I was waiting for my plane to fly out and I went to this place because Santa Fe is known for    
00:49:48.040 their chilies, their good chilies. And I had — Because you eat vegetarian food the entire week.   
00:49:53.307 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I was immediately wondering, how'd that go for you?   
00:49:55.108 Kevin Rose: Oh, dude. I went straight to a double chili burger and a large IPA,    
00:49:59.200 straight out the gate.Tim Ferriss: Oh, God.   
00:50:00.783 Kevin Rose: Which was probably —Tim Ferriss: Actually, you sent photos.   
00:50:01.948 Kevin Rose: Yeah, yeah. I'm sure I did. To you and    
00:50:03.400 Sacca. That's right.Tim Ferriss: So was    
00:50:06.520 that disaster pants at 30,000 feet?Kevin Rose: It was definitely — my stomach was not    
00:50:10.720 happy. I was paying for that. But, yeah. So how much time do you have? Because I know you have —   
00:50:15.787 Tim Ferriss: I have time. I have time.Kevin Rose: Do you want — I    
00:50:17.680 got a really crazy one.Tim Ferriss: Let's do crazy.   
00:50:19.708 Kevin Rose: Okay. Crazy. Is that —Tim Ferriss: We can cut it out if you can't,    
00:50:21.600 but are you allowed to talk about klotha yet?Kevin Rose: Yeah. So Peter Attia did a fantastic    
00:50:26.320 episode, which we both, I would say would highly recommend with —   
00:50:30.747 Tim Ferriss: A hundred percent.Kevin Rose: — Dena, who is a fantastic researcher    
00:50:32.240 out of UCSF. She has identified a compound called klotho, which is just absolutely insane.   
00:50:38.947 Tim Ferriss: Yeah.Kevin Rose: So in fairness,    
00:50:39.880 it was identified by Japanese research.Tim Ferriss: Sorry, sorry, my bad.   
00:50:42.668 Kevin Rose: But she's spent a good part of her career.   
00:50:44.467 Tim Ferriss: She's one of the foremost experts in world.   
00:50:46.371 Kevin Rose: Yes.Tim Ferriss: For sure.   
00:50:46.908 Kevin Rose: Yeah. So she did an episode with the Attia that was a deep dive for about an    
00:50:49.240 hour and a half. And it is — I mean, do you have the kind of stats in front    
00:50:54.800 of you? I can ballpark it if you want.Tim Ferriss: Why don't you ballpark it?   
00:50:58.068 Kevin Rose: So the ballpark it in my understanding is that — so klotho, just so people know,    
00:51:02.520 is that it's naturally produced in humans, especially under high-intensity kind of interval    
00:51:07.600 exercise. So you get more natural level of this. We all have it in our blood right now. As you age,    
00:51:12.400 you get less of it. So the interesting thing in humans that they know is that people that    
00:51:18.600 have these — there's two genes and these genetic polymorphisms — and if you are an overproducer, if    
00:51:23.480 you have these snips where you're an overproducer, meaning you naturally produce more of this klotho,    
00:51:27.400 you just get dramatically less dementia risk.And even if the very famous gene out there is    
00:51:33.960 the APOE3, APOE4 genes, whereas if you are a four carrier, meaning most people are 3-3. If you're a    
00:51:42.280 3-4, you're something like five to seven times more likely to get Alzheimer's. If you're 4-4,    
00:51:47.120 you're kind of fucked. It's 80 percent of people get Alzheimer's or something like that. If you    
00:51:51.120 have one of these snips and you are way more likely to get it, but you're also an overproducer    
00:51:56.720 of klotho, it evens out the playing field.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it's crazy.   
00:51:59.148 Kevin Rose: So don't get the same risk of dementia. So there is a lot of — now    
00:52:02.840 the crazier shit is, forget the mouse studies. The mouse studies are all awesome. They reverse    
00:52:07.320 dementia and all that shit when they give them klotho. When you give it to monkeys,    
00:52:10.960 even if they don't have dementia, they instantly — this is a subcutaneous shot —   
00:52:15.587 Tim Ferriss: Monkey Limitless.Kevin Rose: — they instantly become    
00:52:17.520 20 percent smarter for four weeks, instantly from just getting a little boost of klotho.   
00:52:21.307 Tim Ferriss: It's going to be in the headline. Monkey Limitless.   
00:52:22.868 Kevin Rose: Dude, it's nuts. It's nuts. So we're very close to finishing the deal,    
00:52:28.040 but at True Ventures, we're writing a very big check that I'm leading around into — we're going    
00:52:34.280 to get this in humans in the next year and a half. You're going to participate?   
00:52:38.490 Tim Ferriss: Yeah.Kevin Rose: Attia's going to participate.   
00:52:39.547 Tim Ferriss: And I can read quickly.Kevin Rose: Yeah, please. Just for    
00:52:41.320 people who want to check it out.Tim Ferriss: So this is the name.    
00:52:44.760 I believe it's the name of the episode that Peter has on The Drive, which is his podcast.    
00:52:49.840 "A Breakthrough in Alzheimer’s Disease: The Promising Potential of Klotho for Brain Health,    
00:52:53.520 Cognitive Decline, and as a Therapeutic Tool for Alzheimer’s Disease." So I have    
00:52:56.680 Alzheimer's on both sides of my family. This is —Kevin Rose: But you're a 3-3 though, right?   
00:53:00.747 Tim Ferriss: I'm a 3-3, but I have been interested in tracking this for so long in terms of possible    
00:53:05.880 therapeutic intervention.Kevin Rose: Yes.   
00:53:07.307 Tim Ferriss: That's why I studied neuroscience initially as an undergrad. That's why I was    
00:53:13.440 initially — the very first check I ever cut for supporting science was for Adam Gazzaley    
00:53:17.280 and some of his early stuff.Kevin Rose: That's awesome.   
00:53:18.747 Tim Ferriss: Way back in the day.Kevin Rose: I've also given Adam    
00:53:20.720 some cash to go do some cool stuff.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Adam, check him out. He's    
00:53:23.040 been on the podcast as well. And the description is, I'll just give you this very quickly. So Dena    
00:53:27.680 Dubal is a physician scientist and professor of neurology at UCSF whose work focuses on    
00:53:31.960 mechanisms of longevity and brain resilience. In this episode, Dena Dubal. Okay, that's the    
00:53:38.360 bitters talking. Dena delves into the intricacies.Kevin Rose: The Alzheimer's juice is talking.   
00:53:42.587 Tim Ferriss: The longevity factor klotho. It's formation and distribution in the body,    
00:53:45.840 the factors such as stress and exercise that impacts its level and its profound impact on    
00:53:51.160 cognitive function in overall brain health. I don't want to skip over the exercise because    
00:53:57.440 while you're waiting for this to be available is a subcutaneous or intramuscular shot,    
00:54:01.600 I think should be effective subcutaneous.Kevin Rose: By the way, that's the way    
00:54:05.560 they've gone into monkeys. It's been —Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it's very easy. Very, very,    
00:54:08.720 very simple. It's like using Ozempic or —Kevin Rose: Is Ozempic subcu?   
00:54:11.787 Tim Ferriss: It is, yeah. Very, very simple to do. Not painful. Before that is available,    
00:54:17.360 exercise. Exercise is arguably the most potent way to increase your circulating levels of klotho.   
00:54:24.640 Kevin Rose: Yeah. So we're very excited for this. The potential application here is huge,    
00:54:28.960 obviously. This could be the Ozempic for the mind. We'll see. We'll know more in a bit. And once this    
00:54:34.640 gets funded, I'm excited to see where it goes. But I think this is what I love about just our ability    
00:54:42.520 finally, at this stage in life. Tim, you've done so much on the psychedelic research side, which    
00:54:46.600 has been amazing on the philanthropic side to watch happen. And I started a new Substack, which    
00:54:48.760 is a paid newsletter where I can have a more private community and a hundred percent of the    
00:54:52.960 proceeds from the first month are going in to fund a Matt Walker sleep study in which    
00:54:58.960 he's identified some antioxidants that he believes can repair a bad night's sleep.   
00:55:02.960 Tim Ferriss: So Matt Walker, for those people who don't recognize the name, amazing,    
00:55:07.320 super sweet guy, a brilliant researcher.Kevin Rose: I just had him on the podcast.   
00:55:10.707 Tim Ferriss: Who also wrote Why We Sleep, which was a mega, mega bestseller.   
00:55:14.120 Kevin Rose: And Matt's such a fantastic, well-rounded researcher in the —   
00:55:19.236 Tim Ferriss: Beautiful voice too.Kevin Rose: Yeah. I mean his accent for —   
00:55:22.387 Tim Ferriss: Dulcet, velvet British tones. Soothing.   
00:55:25.588 Kevin Rose: Exactly.Tim Ferriss: He could    
00:55:26.360 read the Cheesecake Factory menu.Kevin Rose: He should read your next book.   
00:55:30.920 Tim Ferriss: And I would listen to it.Kevin Rose: So that's exciting. I am very    
00:55:34.400 excited to — I think you and I both enjoy this idea of moonshots around science because it's    
00:55:41.480 severely underfunded. And if you do get grants —Tim Ferriss: You can do a lot with very little.   
00:55:45.828 Kevin Rose: A lot with very little.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Because otherwise,    
00:55:49.040 this is part of why on a lot of levels, I find it certainly as exciting as the startup investing is    
00:55:56.840 you have these potentially sort of history-bending scientific developments or discoveries that will    
00:56:06.240 take years and years and years to fund through traditional grant writing and government support.    
00:56:13.080 And if you are able to — I know this is not pocket change, but if you're able to cut a check quickly    
00:56:18.800 for say 25, 50 grand, the check I cut for Adam way back in the was 10 grand. That was a big    
00:56:23.760 check for me. You can actually make a difference.Kevin Rose: Can I give you an example of this?   
00:56:27.739 Tim Ferriss: You can accelerate it quickly. Yeah, please.   
00:56:28.940 Kevin Rose: So Dena, who's the principal investigator at UCSF around klotho,    
00:56:32.880 I had a conversation with her and I said, "Hey, what's the study that you want to do right now    
00:56:37.920 on klotho that would take you a year or so to get the grants and blah, blah, blah?" And she's like,    
00:56:43.640 "I got this one that I want to look downstream a little bit further and we can tag klotho and    
00:56:48.600 see where it goes and all this stuff." And I'm like, "What does that cost?" And she's like,    
00:56:51.760 "50k." I was like, "Holy shit." I'm like, "Do you have the researchers ready to go?" She's like, "I    
00:56:55.920 could start this tomorrow." And so, I donated some stock that were these little tiny distributions    
00:57:00.240 that I had received over time and I just donated stock to her, to UCSF, and now she has the funding    
00:57:05.240 and she already started the study like a week and a half later. And it's like I know that's    
00:57:10.040 a lot of money to a lot of people, so please, I'm not trying to flex here on the cash side,    
00:57:13.560 but I'm just saying even $1,000.Tim Ferriss: Flexing so hard.   
00:57:18.409 Kevin Rose: Fuck you. But even sometimes if you get to know these researchers or you hear about    
00:57:22.040 something on Attia's podcast or your podcast where you're like, wow, that's great science being done,    
00:57:26.480 you can call them up, you can email them and say, "Hey,    
00:57:28.880 how can I contribute $100 here?" Oftentimes it can be tax-deductible, depending on the organization.   
00:57:34.240 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Oh, almost always, almost always tax-deductible. And I will say, this    
00:57:40.400 doesn't have to be a super high concept doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people    
00:57:47.000 motivation. It can be, but it is so exciting and gratifying to catalyze science that could, I think    
00:57:59.000 without making it sound too exaggerated, change the world literally in the case of say a Klotho.   
00:58:02.994 Kevin Rose: Oh, dude —Tim Ferriss: And the fact that you can expedite    
00:58:05.880 it for relatively the cost of a car is nuts.Kevin Rose: Dude, so my mom now sometimes    
00:58:16.720 sadly thinks my sister is her mom and she has dementia. And thankfully it's not Alzheimer's.    
00:58:23.440 So we've been with this for about seven years now. And we're going to put this in humans in    
00:58:28.800 a year and a half. My mom's turning 84 in a few weeks. And it's like, I don't know,    
00:58:34.960 there's a chance we get this in her in a couple of years and we get some more    
00:58:38.400 great memories back. We get a little bit more of even, I can't guarantee what's going to happen,    
00:58:42.480 but even just a little bit more awareness would be beautiful, beautiful. So it's like    
00:58:48.800 this is what motivates me more than anything.Tim Ferriss: And we're an age also where it's    
00:58:53.280 almost every friend in our same cohort is having this experience.   
00:58:58.326 Kevin Rose: Oh, a hundred percent.Tim Ferriss: At least one parent, usually both.   
00:59:00.388 Kevin Rose: I'm sure there's probably a thousand people listening    
00:59:02.800 right now that are like, "I hear you."Tim Ferriss: Starting to fray the ends.   
00:59:04.760 Kevin Rose: A hundred percent.Tim Ferriss: And it's so painful to watch.    
00:59:07.920 I remember watching my grandparents kind of descend to the point where they didn't necessarily    
00:59:13.600 recognize me or my brother, or anything like that. And if you could just add a few years or    
00:59:21.280 cut down on the symptoms by 20 percent, it's so significant for not just their quality of life,    
00:59:31.120 hopefully, but also the interpersonal relationships and the whole family constellation.   
00:59:35.108 Kevin Rose: The relationships is the big thing. When people go, they go. But just to have that    
00:59:39.880 awareness of who is around you when you do go, I think is just such a huge deal.   
00:59:45.400 What else you got? I got some crazy ones. I got more crazy ones.   
00:59:48.000 Tim Ferriss: Bring some crazy, bring your crazy.Kevin Rose: So I talked to my dead    
00:59:50.800 dad via a medium.Tim Ferriss: Okay,    
00:59:54.240 all right. Didn't see that coming.Kevin Rose: Yeah. Yeah. It was on my    
00:59:57.000 list of stories to talk about.Tim Ferriss: All right, yeah, tell me.   
00:59:59.228 Kevin Rose: So my tattoo artist was out here and gave me this fantastic tattoo. Jess is awesome.    
01:00:01.916 And she was like, "Hey, there's this crazy shit that happened to me." And I'm like, "What's up?"    
01:00:05.160 And she's like, "I tattooed this woman that was a medium and she gifted me a free session." And I'm    
01:00:11.840 like, "Was it crazy?" And she's like, "You have no idea." She's like, "Okay, a bunch of people…" So    
01:00:18.440 cute that Toaster's coming to say hi to you.Tim Ferriss: Toaster just keeps coming    
01:00:20.360 to say hi to me.Kevin Rose: He definitely missed you.    
01:00:23.440 So I'm the biggest skeptic on this shit. I take this as entertainment value. And so she was like,    
01:00:30.120 "No, you don't understand." Someone, I don't want to get into her personal details, but someone that    
01:00:33.960 was not directly related to her, but one step removed of her immediate family had been shot    
01:00:39.480 and killed. And this person came in and said, "Listen, I had been..." This is not Googleable,    
01:00:46.920 you couldn't have found this anywhere, was like, I am the person that was shot in this particular    
01:00:52.080 location at this particular spot, like crazy scary, really accurate. And I was like, "Oh,    
01:00:58.960 my God." And she kept going, and I'm not going to go into her personal details, but enough to where    
01:01:03.200 I was like, "Give me the number." I want to book this $150 session, it's 150. And so I book it and    
01:01:12.520 it's early because she's back east. And I get up at 7:00 a.m., barely have my coffee. And she goes,    
01:01:17.840 "Oh, my God, she goes, "There is this person that is beating down my door to talk    
01:01:21.840 to you." And I'm like, "Okay." And she's like —Tim Ferriss: Wait, this is what the medium said?   
01:01:25.991 Kevin Rose: Medium said, yeah, we were on Zoom. And I'm like, "Okay."   
01:01:29.347 Tim Ferriss: He's got a start-up in dog cosmetics.Kevin Rose: And please. Yeah, exactly.   
01:01:35.267 Tim Ferriss: They want to pitch you.Kevin Rose: It's a great pre-money    
01:01:38.280 valuation. They only want a million dollars. The dog cosmetics are, it's going to boom, you watch.    
01:01:44.960 So it's the next AI. So basically I was like, I'm kind of early, whatever. And I'm like, okay,    
01:01:47.160 I'm very Googleable, I am aware of that, and you can find out things about my dad and stuff like    
01:01:52.440 that. And she's like, "It's a man. He passed from some heart tension," and my dad died of a heart    
01:02:02.080 stroke. And I'm like, okay, well, you can Google that. And then she's describing all kinds of stuff    
01:02:08.440 and even including a fight with my mom the night before, little tiny bits. So my sister did it too,    
01:02:17.640 and we didn't tell him we were related because my sister has a different last    
01:02:19.720 name. And so with my sister, it was like, oh, he's good with numbers. He was an accountant.   
01:02:24.960 And he was just saying that, he kept saying the number three. And she's like, "Is there a third    
01:02:32.240 sibling?" And I've never told anybody this, but I have a half-sister that I didn't know about,    
01:02:36.960 that's never been on the internet. And I was like, I started sobbing, dude, immediately.    
01:02:41.520 Because I get that it's entertainment value, but just to feel. And what she said is she goes,    
01:02:47.400 "He's very proud of you." And that just hit me like — It's like I don't care if it's real or not,    
01:02:54.440 just to hear that. And even if two percent of your body can say that might be real,    
01:02:59.120 you immediately break down. And so snot's coming out of my nose and shit over Zoom and there's    
01:03:03.720 no filter to turn that off. And it was just very therapeutic. And I was just like, holy shit. And    
01:03:12.080 the amount of that she got right was scary.Tim Ferriss: Did she whiff on anything?   
01:03:17.927 Kevin Rose: I'm trying to think. Gosh. It's funny, once you start believing it and once    
01:03:20.680 you're halfway in, you don't want to ask any questions that might get them to whiff.   
01:03:24.060 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, to disconfirm.Kevin Rose: Yeah, exactly.    
01:03:26.880 But I've got to say there was a bunch of stuff where she was like, your girls and one of them    
01:03:32.800 looks a lot like your dad and has that same kind of energy, and he likes to watch them play because    
01:03:39.840 he thinks it's really cute how one of them is like this, and was predicting their personalities    
01:03:44.840 to the tee, like absolutely perfect. And so then I have Darya do it, my wife, and her mom    
01:03:51.040 comes to her, and scary accurate again. And everyone's going to be asking for this URL,    
01:03:56.120 I swear I'm not trying to plug any medium here and sell medium things, but it was insane, dude.   
01:04:03.520 Tim Ferriss: Dogcosmetics.com/kevkev.Kevin Rose: Yeah, exactly. Get that    
01:04:06.120 coupon code. So do you have anybody that's passed away that you'd want to talk to?   
01:04:09.587 Tim Ferriss: Sure, yeah. I mean if I could. Right? I mean I've gone out to the edges pretty hard in    
01:04:16.760 my subjective experience, a lot of experiments. But I would say I've also watched, for instance,    
01:04:27.880 there's a documentary about the Amazing Randi called An Honest Liar, and I've watched    
01:04:31.840 documentaries on mentalists. And you watch, say, performers like Derren Brown who are —   
01:04:38.570 Kevin Rose: Like how they can read and lean in.Tim Ferriss: I mean the stuff they can do is —   
01:04:41.102 Kevin Rose: Yeah, it's insane.Tim Ferriss: It's just beyond,    
01:04:43.200 I shouldn't say it's beyond explanation, but it's very hard to explain, very convincing. So    
01:04:49.160 I'm very skeptical, but if I could somehow assure myself that I had shielded them from the potential    
01:04:58.280 of Googling things and figuring things out, if I could come in blind. Like maybe the appointment's    
01:05:03.360 made someone else's name and then I show up.Kevin Rose: Tim Berriss. Yeah, Tim Berriss.   
01:05:06.507 Tim Ferriss: Then I'm like, "Okay, here I am. Yeah, tell me." I mean, certainly I'm game to try.   
01:05:10.640 Kevin Rose: I'll pay for your session. I want you to see if this holds up for anybody else.   
01:05:15.484 Tim Ferriss: I'll try, I'll try it. Yeah, I'll try it. My feeling is, and this is maybe people    
01:05:19.680 are going to be like, wow, Tim Ferriss is wearing a tinfoil hat and we've lost him, he's out at sea,    
01:05:26.160 especially after my sort of mimetic contagion comment earlier. But there are a lot of,    
01:05:29.773 I think it's very sort of, it's impossible to dispute that there's a lot we don't understand.   
01:05:32.748 Kevin Rose: Yes, a hundred percent.Tim Ferriss: That does not mean that    
01:05:35.040 these things are unexplainable. It's not invoking necessarily the supernatural per se. But there's a    
01:05:41.440 lot of weird shit that we can't currently explain. And so in the meantime, if we're waiting for a    
01:05:46.760 scientific agreement or consensus or breakthrough that it's accepted, I'm happy to experiment,    
01:05:54.200 as long as you have some preparation and safeguards in advance so that you're not    
01:06:01.120 a mark for fooling yourself really easily.Kevin Rose: Well, here's the funny thing is    
01:06:05.480 she never, so out of myself, Darya, and my sister, she never asked for a rebook appointment. In fact,    
01:06:12.200 my sister, she had a bunch of people that came to her that she didn't recognize and she got    
01:06:15.680 to my dad a little bit later and she's like, "Listen, I'm so sorry, this never happens. I    
01:06:19.400 want to give you a free session for free. Come back next time." It was very weird and there    
01:06:24.720 was none of that salesy shit. I'm always on the lookout for that kind of stuff. Anyway,    
01:06:29.440 we'll have you do it.Tim Ferriss: "Sorry,    
01:06:30.080 our time's up," like a cliffhanger.Kevin Rose: Yeah, exactly,    
01:06:33.000 exactly. "I found your dad."Tim Ferriss: "Oh, he gave    
01:06:35.200 me five of the winning lottery ticket numbers. Oh, sorry, we're out of time."   
01:06:39.979 Kevin Rose: Exactly. But it was one of these random things that you just walk into in life and    
01:06:43.240 you say yes to and it was, like, weirdly awesome.Tim Ferriss: I mean, look, I'll give you,    
01:06:47.920 this is like two drinks definitely informing what I'm about to say. But in my experience,    
01:06:54.040 so I get, say, soft tissue treatment once a week, I get a massage treatment.   
01:06:59.082 Kevin Rose: Like a handy?Tim Ferriss: What was that?   
01:06:59.708 Kevin Rose: I said a handy.Tim Ferriss: No.   
01:07:01.788 Kevin Rose: What does that mean?Tim Ferriss: No dragon rolls,    
01:07:03.160 no happy endings. I'm saying just massage treatment. I have people who work on because    
01:07:07.920 I've broken my body so many times.Kevin Rose: Oh, like a good    
01:07:10.361 massage. Okay. Yeah, yeah.Tim Ferriss: And there are certain    
01:07:12.400 people who have bizarre abilities that they cannot explain. They are just good at fixing —   
01:07:18.228 Kevin Rose: Like the Reiki people.Tim Ferriss: It doesn't necessarily even    
01:07:20.280 have to be that far afield from manual therapy. There are just some people who have very seemingly    
01:07:30.280 strange abilities and they have incredible track records. And when they try to teach other people    
01:07:37.080 their method, it does not translate. Their disciples are unable to do what they do.    
01:07:43.880 And I don't know how to explain that, but there seems to be an extreme variance between outcomes.   
01:07:51.520 And there's some people who are very purely secular. They have their technique, they can    
01:07:55.560 explain it, and they're effectively architects and carpenters of the human body and they're able to    
01:08:01.520 do some miraculous, I shouldn't say miraculous, but predictably effective things based on their    
01:08:07.800 understanding of the human body. Then there are people who just seem to operate on a different    
01:08:12.800 channel, and I don't know what to make of that. And I would say any athlete who has competed for    
01:08:18.640 a long time or had a lot of manual therapy will have a story about someone like this.   
01:08:23.108 Kevin Rose: Why do you say athlete?Tim Ferriss: Well, just because they're going to —   
01:08:25.683 Kevin Rose: Like flow state stuff or like —Tim Ferriss: No, because they're going to    
01:08:28.399 injure themselves or they're just going to have more table time than an average person. You talk    
01:08:34.120 to the average person on the street, I mean, by and large, when did you have your last massage,    
01:08:36.899 it's like never, five years ago, two years ago. Whereas if somebody is a very serious athlete,    
01:08:42.760 they're probably getting some type of manual therapy once every, I mean at least once a month,    
01:08:48.680 if not once a week. If they're like an Olympic sprinter or something, they're probably getting it    
01:08:53.040 every day or every other day, something like that.Kevin Rose: Right. Can I ask you a question that    
01:08:56.160 you may want to cut from the podcast?Tim Ferriss: Sure.   
01:08:59.148 Kevin Rose: You told me once that during one of your ayahuasca sessions that it was either    
01:09:05.319 someone had spoken in a different tongue that they didn't know or there was something crazy.    
01:09:10.840 What is the craziest Tim Ferriss supernatural thing that you've ever seen in your life?   
01:09:14.805 Tim Ferriss: Oh, so I'm going to, that's a good question. I'm going to pull out the    
01:09:17.600 supernatural just because —Kevin Rose: Okay, natural.   
01:09:23.080 Tim Ferriss: Hypernatural. Simply because I don't think these things are beyond    
01:09:25.359 explanation. We just lack perhaps the tools or the —   
01:09:29.468 Kevin Rose: To measure it.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. We can't currently    
01:09:32.080 investigate any of these phenomena in a granular enough way to make it gratifying. Yeah. Okay.   
01:09:37.993 Kevin Rose: Give me a couple good ones. Come on.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I'll give you some good ones. I    
01:09:40.880 mean, so I have a decent amount of flight time, I guess we can call it. I have seen on a few — now,    
01:09:50.960 what I'm going to do is I'm going to describe what I saw and then I'm going to debunk it.   
01:09:56.344 Kevin Rose: And I know you don't lie, which is what's awesome. It's like I've known you    
01:09:58.920 long enough to know that you're a very, very trustworthy, legit person. You don't embellish,    
01:10:03.160 which I think is great.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I try    
01:10:04.800 not to. And I also try to cross examine.Kevin Rose: Yeah. You're very skeptical,    
01:10:09.680 dude, which I love. It's great.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So I've seen a    
01:10:13.160 few people, this is first person, speak or sing in languages that they do not speak during —   
01:10:19.508 Kevin Rose: Like in tongues shit where you're like I can't understand    
01:10:21.440 you and they're like [inaudible]?Tim Ferriss: No, no, no,    
01:10:23.000 no. You can hear them coherently.Kevin Rose: And you speak a lot of languages.   
01:10:27.547 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I do.Kevin Rose: So were they    
01:10:29.080 ever speaking a language that you understood where you're like, no?   
01:10:32.011 Tim Ferriss: Yes.Kevin Rose: What language?   
01:10:32.747 Tim Ferriss: Spanish.Kevin Rose: Well, that's an easy    
01:10:34.400 one. They could have watched enough like —Tim Ferriss: No, no, no, no. These are people    
01:10:37.760 without any exposure or been —Kevin Rose: They didn't watch    
01:10:40.320 Dora the Explorer or anything as kids. They could have picked up a lot of shit.   
01:10:43.661 Tim Ferriss: Look, I'm not fluent in these languages, but like the Shipibo, or like from    
01:10:46.880 the Shipibo-Conibo people or Kichwa-Lamista.Kevin Rose: And these were like white people    
01:10:51.560 coming in like where you didn't have any —Tim Ferriss: Yeah. They're coming in blind. They    
01:10:54.240 couldn't even tell you the names of these tribes.Kevin Rose: Holy fuck.   
01:10:57.153 Tim Ferriss: Or indigenous peoples.Kevin Rose: Like how many    
01:10:58.400 words? Like one or two words?Tim Ferriss: No, we're talking like an hour.   
01:11:01.308 Kevin Rose: What?Tim Ferriss: Yeah.   
01:11:02.388 Kevin Rose: And you've seen this firsthand?Tim Ferriss: Yes. And I also have what I    
01:11:07.280 would consider credible witnesses, people who are hyper-competent in their own lives,    
01:11:13.960 they have very effective careers, et cetera, et cetera. These are not people who are just    
01:11:20.080 navel-gazing folks who do personal development seminars every two days and don't have    
01:11:27.040 a job. These are real operators who have seen, in one instance, this woman who ended up speaking    
01:11:35.240 what sounded like in tongues, but there was an academic there who later was like, oh,    
01:11:43.760 it was something like ancient BLEEP language.Kevin Rose: Holy fuck.   
01:11:46.747 Tim Ferriss: It was something that he could identify. And he's like, "Oh, yeah, that's a dead    
01:11:48.920 language." He's like, "But I've studied enough of it." He's like, "That's what she was chanting in."   
01:11:52.687 Kevin Rose: Is any of this being recorded?Tim Ferriss: No. So if I were to take    
01:11:56.240 the debunk side of this, I would say, "Well, everyone's tripping balls." So let's be honest,    
01:12:02.440 everybody could just be making up the never-ending story fantasy that they want to be true because    
01:12:08.520 they're trying to recapture some mystery in a world that seems just like profane and disgusting.   
01:12:15.028 Kevin Rose: And this is all ayahuasca.Tim Ferriss: Those examples are all ayahuasca,    
01:12:18.960 but it's not limited to that. It seems to be particularly prevalent. Reports, let me be clear,    
01:12:24.800 not occurrences, but reports of these types of events or phenomena are most widely reported,    
01:12:34.880 it seems, in cases of ayahuasca. But the format I think matters in the sense that it may not    
01:12:42.920 be limited to ayahuasca, which is a brew, it's a combination of different plants. So Banisteriopsis    
01:12:50.320 caapi in the case of the vine, and then Psychotria viridis if they're using chacruna, also another    
01:12:55.560 name for the same thing. So it's a bit of a cocktail. You can think of it as an old-fashioned,    
01:12:59.560 there are a lot of ways to put a spin on an old-fashioned, and depending on the brew,    
01:13:02.680 it's going to be very, very different.Kevin Rose: I had one the other day    
01:13:04.200 with the cognac and it was so good.Tim Ferriss: So I could tell you what    
01:13:08.040 is not delicious is ayahuasca. But the point I was going to make is that I think the reports    
01:13:12.680 in part are more frequent with ayahuasca than, say, psilocybin or more psilocybin mushrooms,    
01:13:19.320 let's say, or LSD, because ayahuasca is almost by default, at least in the syncretic mestizo    
01:13:28.160 neo-shamanic formats that you see say in North America and at a lot of the ayahuasca tourism    
01:13:34.800 places. It's inevitably in a group context. And so when you have a group together, the dynamic,    
01:13:42.680 the potential for storytelling, the volume of things that you will observe from other people    
01:13:51.320 is just higher than if you're laying on a mat by yourself taking mushrooms.   
01:13:55.040 Kevin Rose: Of course, yeah.Tim Ferriss: So I think since that    
01:13:57.640 shared experience is such an intrinsic part of most ayahuasca circles as North Americans    
01:14:05.720 experience it, that it's almost inevitable that you're going to get more reports of these types    
01:14:11.960 of things. And who knows, maybe people are just hearing and seeing what they want to see.    
01:14:17.160 They are ultimately considered hallucinogens, although I do think there's more to the story.   
01:14:22.068 Kevin Rose: That's crazy.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. And I will say,    
01:14:26.160 when you're listening to anyone talk about fucking crazy town, which is what we're talking about    
01:14:30.120 right now, and this is not to say that I'm the ultimate impeccable objective witness of reality,    
01:14:36.880 but you just have to ask yourself, has this person demonstrated the ability to reason and logic their    
01:14:45.440 way through other complicated problems? Because if they haven't demonstrated that and they believe in    
01:14:51.560 the fucking Tooth Fairy and spirits and ayahuasca, then you really don't have a    
01:14:57.560 basis for judging their judgment. But if someone comes in and they are demonstrably world-class    
01:15:07.440 in a bunch of domains, a real operator, very skeptical, and nonetheless they have these    
01:15:12.680 experiences and they're just like, "What the fuck was that?" then it's more interesting.   
01:15:18.708 Kevin Rose: Yeah, I had a jet navy fighter pilot named Ryan Graves on my podcast.   
01:15:24.107 Tim Ferriss: Ryan Graves?Kevin Rose: Yeah, like the Uber Ryan Graves,    
01:15:27.120 but a fighter pilot. And he's the one that came out and said, "I saw some crazy alien ships in    
01:15:33.160 the sky." And we talked an hour and a half for what it's like and the training that he does and    
01:15:38.200 the sensors that they have in these jets. And you're like, there is nothing — this guy is the    
01:15:44.040 most credible dude on earth. He's a retired Navy fighter pilot. There was no, he wasn't kicked —   
01:15:51.459 Addison: [inaudible].Kevin Rose: Oh, we've got —   
01:15:55.280 Tim Ferriss: Here we go.Addison: Can I have the corner bit?   
01:15:56.580 Tim Ferriss: Oh, my God.Kevin Rose: You can have the corner bit.   
01:15:56.644 Tim Ferriss: Here we go.Kevin Rose: What is this?   
01:15:57.080 Addison: So this is —Tim Ferriss: I sense some egg whites.   
01:15:59.420 Addison: :So unfortunately — yeah, egg whites. I got you.   
01:16:02.200 Tim Ferriss: Thank you.Kevin Rose: Thank you.   
01:16:03.751 Addison: It's apricot liqueur again, I apologize.Tim Ferriss: Ooh, I like this little    
01:16:07.880 clothespin. It's very nice.Kevin Rose: Little clip, yeah.   
01:16:09.958 Tim Ferriss: Kevin, etiquette.Kevin Rose: Sorry, sorry. Please, please, please.   
01:16:11.747 Tim Ferriss: Must be some decorum.Kevin Rose: Sorry.   
01:16:14.220 Addison: Lemon juice, bitters, and then our world-famous tequila there.   
01:16:19.908 Kevin Rose: Tequila. Oh, nice. That's not tequila. That's my water. That's my water.   
01:16:23.623 Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah, the LALO.Addison: Egg whites.   
01:16:25.030 Kevin Rose: Egg whites, okay. Cheers.Tim Ferriss: Egg white. It's healthy. It's    
01:16:26.680 basically a protein shake.Kevin Rose: Yeah,    
01:16:28.520 exactly, exactly.Tim Ferriss: So to what, Kevin?   
01:16:32.800 Kevin Rose: To experimentation.Tim Ferriss: To experimentation.   
01:16:38.520 That's outstanding.Kevin Rose: Jesus, that's    
01:16:39.440 probably the best one yet.Tim Ferriss: Outstanding.    
01:16:41.000 I'm going to be laying on —Kevin Rose: You get on a flight,    
01:16:43.440 you're fine. All right, what do you have? Do you have anything else or do you want me to go on?    
01:16:47.520 I've got one or two more, if you want to go there.Tim Ferriss: Why don't you fire away? I mean    
01:16:50.320 basically here, there are a few things that I can recommend    
01:16:53.840 just in case people are looking.Kevin Rose: Yeah, let's do a couple    
01:16:56.578 recommendations, then I have one crazy one.Tim Ferriss: I'll make it fast. So just in case    
01:16:58.440 people are looking for a couple of recommendations for things that over the last few months I have    
01:17:04.480 found really compelling in viewing or reading, a few things. So one is Jerry Seinfeld's Duke    
01:17:10.880 commencement speech.Kevin Rose: Oh, yes.   
01:17:12.827 Tim Ferriss: Amazing.Kevin Rose: Amazing.   
01:17:13.867 Tim Ferriss: Amazing. Just trust me, check it out. Then there's a very old documentary that I watched    
01:17:20.800 again, David Hockney: The Art of Seeing.Kevin Rose: Going to write that down.   
01:17:26.143 Tim Ferriss: And David Hockney is an incredibly well-known artist,    
01:17:29.320 perhaps Britain's best-loved living artist.Kevin Rose: The Art of Seeing, okay.   
01:17:32.903 Tim Ferriss: And The Art of Seeing really dives into through interviews his way of viewing the    
01:17:38.840 world, art, and life. It's tremendous. And you can find it on YouTube. You might be    
01:17:44.960 able to find it elsewhere, but it's actually surprisingly hard to find.   
01:17:47.720 In terms of books, after many, many people recommended it and I had a hell of a time    
01:17:53.440 getting into it, it took 20 or 30 pages, so just suffer through the first 20 or 30 pages. It is one    
01:17:58.400 of the most beautifully written books I've ever read, also probably the most brutal book. It is    
01:18:03.040 just brutal, brutal, brutal, called —Kevin Rose: Brutal in what way?   
01:18:05.320 Tim Ferriss: Okay, so it's called Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy. And it's been selected —   
01:18:11.188 Kevin Rose: You got this in on Audible?Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you can get in on Audible.    
01:18:11.960 I listened to it. It was actually great narration. Selected by The Atlantic as one of the great    
01:18:15.920 American novels of the past 100 years.Kevin Rose: Oh, shit.   
01:18:18.867 Tim Ferriss: Here's an endorsement. One of the quotes from Michael Herr,    
01:18:21.840 I think that's how you say it, H-E-R-R, "A classic American novel of regeneration through violence.    
01:18:26.800 McCarthy can only be compared to our greatest writers like Melville, et cetera, et cetera. And    
01:18:31.160 this is his masterpiece." So it's brutal in the sense that it is set in the Wild West,    
01:18:38.280 but the Hobbesian behavior of humans and just evil acts of brutality are just beyond vile.   
01:18:48.828 Kevin Rose: Is this going to be a Quentin Tarantino film in 10    
01:18:50.920 years kind of thing, or five years?Tim Ferriss: It would be hard to make    
01:18:53.680 an adaptation. I think it'd be hard to sell because people would just come out of the    
01:18:57.120 movie theaters being like, "What the fuck did I just do to myself?" But the prose is    
01:19:02.320 so gorgeous. I mean, this is one of those books that I listened to and I was like,    
01:19:07.080 I should just fucking hang up my spurs and be done with writing.   
01:19:09.520 Kevin Rose: Oh, shit, really?Tim Ferriss: This writing is so good.   
01:19:11.588 Kevin Rose: Oh, fuck.Tim Ferriss: This writing is so good,    
01:19:15.640 it blows — maybe this guy's an alien. It doesn't seem conceivable to me that a human could produce    
01:19:22.480 this. It's so good.Kevin Rose: AI.   
01:19:24.707 Tim Ferriss: Now, I will warn you, if you listen to the audiobook, in the beginning of chapters,    
01:19:28.200 they have these, they're not quite random, but they're foreshadowing snippets of different    
01:19:32.720 phrases, and it's confusing as fuck on the audiobook. So when he's like "Marshmallow tobacco,    
01:19:38.680 a man finds a dog, hat in the wind," and you're like, what the fuck is happening?   
01:19:43.028 Kevin Rose: That's the perfect Quentin Tarantino little slide that they put up on the screen.   
01:19:46.707 Tim Ferriss: They always, yeah, exactly. So that's at the beginning    
01:19:49.120 of every chapter, but it's outstanding.If you want something that is shorter and also    
01:19:55.040 metaphorically quite beautiful, The Bear by Andrew Krivak, I think if I'm saying his name correctly,    
01:20:01.640 is a beautiful story of a girl and her father who lived close to the land in the shadow of a lone    
01:20:06.720 mountain. The father teaches the girl how to fish and hunt the secrets of the seasons and the stars.    
01:20:10.920 He's preparing her for an adulthood in harmony with nature, for they are the last of humankind.    
01:20:15.240 I'll just stop there. But it's beautiful. I finished it in a handful of days. It's very short.    
01:20:22.240 That's a very special book. Really, really fast.Kevin Rose: If you're doing documentaries, I want    
01:20:25.920 to throw one out there. You've probably seen this and I just watched it again for the second time.    
01:20:29.880 It's called The Birth of Saké.Tim Ferriss: Never seen it.   
01:20:32.508 Kevin Rose: What?Tim Ferriss: No.   
01:20:33.708 Kevin Rose: Oh, dude, this is a beautiful story.Tim Ferriss: Now, we tasted    
01:20:36.160 a lot of sake in Japan.Kevin Rose: We did. Yeah,    
01:20:38.000 we went to actually one of the breweries and took it right out of the spigot. It was amazing.   
01:20:42.218 Tim Ferriss: That was so good.Kevin Rose: So The Birth of Saké    
01:20:43.760 is about a traditional handmade, there's only a thousand of them left. There used    
01:20:49.640 to be like 4,000 like a decade ago, and now it's down to a thousand handmade.   
01:20:52.987 Tim Ferriss: Sounds like Japan.Kevin Rose: And well, they're like machines    
01:20:56.280 and automation and all that are taking over. And this is about, I didn't know if you knew this, but    
01:21:01.720 if you're actually making sake, you have to tend to it for about six months around the clock. And    
01:21:06.240 so they get together in these little tiny micro homes where they live, they leave their families    
01:21:12.640 and they just work on sake for six months. And so this covers old men, young men coming in,    
01:21:19.040 like tradition, the handing off of reigns to one generation to another, somebody dying,    
01:21:24.840 the whole thing, and it's beautiful. And it's this little tiny brewery called Yoshida Brewery. And    
01:21:31.080 so there's a great store in San Francisco, I'm sure you probably remember it, called True Sake.    
01:21:35.000 Remember over in, sorry, in —Tim Ferriss: Hayes Valley?   
01:21:36.468 Kevin Rose: Hayes Valley, yeah.Tim Ferriss: Yeah.   
01:21:37.628 Kevin Rose: So they actually —Tim Ferriss: I bought a sake there    
01:21:39.040 called Hitorimusume, which means "single daughter," which to this    
01:21:43.320 day I've been trying to find. So good.Kevin Rose: So they actually sell this, I    
01:21:47.400 found this sake, I have it upstairs, we can take a sip of it, I bought. But it's not much, it's like    
01:21:51.240 $50 a bottle. But it's this little tiny family. The story is beautiful. It's all 4K. There's snow    
01:21:56.280 falling in slow motion. Highly recommend watching that documentary, The Birth of Saké. That's my go.   
01:22:03.747 Tim Ferriss: What else do you got? I've got a short one.   
01:22:05.388 Kevin Rose: Okay, go.Tim Ferriss: All right,    
01:22:06.440 so this is a video that was sent to me by my friend Mike. You've got to watch this. You've    
01:22:11.200 got to watch this. It's called —Kevin Rose: Is this some of    
01:22:12.920 the stuff we send each other normally?Tim Ferriss: No. No. Not that horrific mutually    
01:22:17.560 assured destruction known as our group chat.Kevin Rose: Yeah. Like you can never make it out.   
01:22:20.707 Tim Ferriss: No, no, no, no. It's called Hi Ren, R-E-N, by Ren, who is a musician, storyteller,    
01:22:27.800 lyricist. And it's fucking incredible. You have never seen anything like it. And this    
01:22:33.880 is a combination of talent, craziness/lunacy, philosophy, redemption, and relief. The lyrics    
01:22:42.080 are so good. It's a one man performance where he's playing a guitar. He looks like a mental patient,    
01:22:46.600 he's in an inpatient outfit, gets wheeled in. And it's just him and a guitar and    
01:22:52.480 he goes back and forth playing the light and dark sides of himself having a conversation.   
01:22:58.828 Kevin Rose: Oh, shit.Tim Ferriss: It is so good.   
01:23:00.341 Kevin Rose: Can we watch it now or no?Tim Ferriss: It's probably too long to watch now.   
01:23:04.950 Kevin Rose: All right, I'll watch it.Tim Ferriss: You should watch    
01:23:06.120 it. It will blow your mind.Kevin Rose: All right, we'll link    
01:23:08.760 it up. This is some good, I love when we throw out the random links that are just really good.   
01:23:13.067 Tim Ferriss: This one, seriously, I was like, oh, I'm not the only one who's fucking crazy. Oh,    
01:23:17.400 that's great. Oh, that's great.Kevin Rose: Fantastic.   
01:23:20.227 Tim Ferriss: I love that.Kevin Rose: We're all fucking crazy.   
01:23:22.191 Tim Ferriss: We're all fucking crazy.Kevin Rose: God, what a relief.   
01:23:23.920 Tim Ferriss: So that's definitely one that came to mind.   
01:23:26.948 Kevin Rose: All right, I've got my last story of the day,    
01:23:28.440 and then maybe you have one to add on top of this. So I'm taking a lot of risk here in that —   
01:23:34.380 Tim Ferriss: Tantalizing.Kevin Rose: — speaking about podcasts that    
01:23:37.360 we don't want to do what everybody else is doing. One of the things that was a complete tragedy that    
01:23:43.680 we can all agree upon is that Matthew Perry's passing away from ketamine overdose or becoming    
01:23:49.080 unconscious and then drowning in the pool. A lot of data came out recently. Did you see that story?   
01:23:53.963 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I did.Kevin Rose: It was really    
01:23:54.560 horrible. These doctors were conspiring to give him as much as he wanted and injecting    
01:23:59.120 him with what would be considered to be —Tim Ferriss: Like a general anesthesia dose.   
01:24:02.422 Kevin Rose: Yeah, exactly. Enough to put you out. And obviously you don't want to    
01:24:05.400 fall asleep in the hot tub.Tim Ferriss: Doesn't mix with    
01:24:08.120 water. Right. It doesn't mix with water.Kevin Rose: Yeah. So the thing that bummed    
01:24:09.880 me out about that is that we talked about this before about my treatment like six months ago,    
01:24:14.120 and I feel fantastic after that treatment, but the thing that bummed me out is that —   
01:24:17.787 Tim Ferriss: Meaning intravenous. Was it intravenous or muscular?   
01:24:20.382 Kevin Rose: I did intravenous, yeah.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So IV ketamine treatment.   
01:24:23.068 Kevin Rose: Yeah. So I did it, I did the six sessions and I was going through a really hard    
01:24:27.120 startup and I feel as good as ever, which is great. Since then, when we did that podcast,    
01:24:34.800 I've had, and I can't say on camera, but I've had a household name that has built a business    
01:24:40.360 that is bigger than you and I have ever built, that would be a shock to the world that hit me up    
01:24:45.480 and was like, I did this and it changed my life. And they've since paid for a bunch of people to    
01:24:49.760 do it after them that were really suffering. That person in particular was having some depression,    
01:24:54.720 things of that nature, that was treatment resistant depression was what they call it.    
01:24:59.400 Colleague of mine hit me up and was like, "I have suicidal thoughts. I'm not going to kill myself,    
01:25:06.440 but I hate that I have them every day." And —Tim Ferriss: Also a scary message to get.   
01:25:11.228 Kevin Rose: Yeah. But she went and did five treatments and is now in full remission. And    
01:25:17.240 I was like, this is amazing. And it kills me that, I mean, obviously there are insane dangers around    
01:25:24.320 recreational use. I'm not disputing that at all. And it's being used in clubs. It's being    
01:25:29.280 used all over the place as a dis-associative. And I get that it's really bad. But I wanted to    
01:25:33.600 go out and say, if I'm going to do a different podcast on this, I want to have in an expert,    
01:25:39.320 which I brought my doctor in. Her name is Dr. Jen. She's a Princeton-trained doctor.   
01:25:43.920 Tim Ferriss: Not a chiropractor.Kevin Rose: Not a chiropractor.   
01:25:46.947 Tim Ferriss: No offense to chiropractors, but they tend to do the Dr. Bob, Dr. Jack, Dr. Jen thing.   
01:25:51.068 Kevin Rose: Yeah. You don't want a chiropractor doing this, but she's been    
01:25:53.600 an ER room doctor for like 15 years.Tim Ferriss: Now I feel like a dick.    
01:25:56.680 I'm going to have to say there's some great chiropractors out there who I work with,    
01:26:00.400 but you don't want them running your ketamine.Kevin Rose: Right, exactly. And she gets into    
01:26:03.440 that and she's like, "This is why we need to take this seriously." And so we did the whole podcast    
01:26:10.560 and we take it from a very scientific point of view, talking about the neuroplasticity,    
01:26:14.320 talking about her outcomes that she's witnessed, blah, blah. But the crazy thing that I added    
01:26:18.520 onto this, and this is coming out in like a week or so, is that I actually said, "Okay,    
01:26:22.800 I will go in to demystify this." And I went into the clinic and I did inner    
01:26:29.060 muscular, which is just a shot in the arm.Tim Ferriss: That's what runs the rocket ship.   
01:26:33.224 Kevin Rose: And I tried to stay as conscious as I could and explain the feelings as I was    
01:26:37.920 starting to go into La La Land.Tim Ferriss: All right.   
01:26:39.631 Kevin Rose: Now let me tell you why.Tim Ferriss: Are you going to share    
01:26:40.360 marble mouth moments?Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah, 100 percent.   
01:26:44.039 Tim Ferriss: [inaudible].Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah, there's    
01:26:44.560 all that in there. But —Tim Ferriss: It is an    
01:26:47.040 anesthetic. Doesn't generally help you talk.Kevin Rose: No. I had to stop and restart the    
01:26:51.280 same sentence like five times. But I will tell you the reason why I did this is very simply    
01:26:56.720 because of my friend that was suffering from severe depression that she knew me personally.    
01:27:01.240 And she's like, "I saw you do this, and I saw it have a positive benefit." I am not    
01:27:06.800 recommending anyone to do this. But there is a subset of people out there that are suffering,    
01:27:11.200 that are seriously contemplating horrible things, and I just want them to check it out and also see    
01:27:18.120 what a high quality clinic looks like. Don't go to the chiropractor, just look inside of —   
01:27:23.423 Tim Ferriss: I'm so sorry I said that.Kevin Rose: Yeah. No, but it's true though.    
01:27:25.800 Let's not say chiropractors, but people that have access to this compound. Don't go to them.    
01:27:29.600 But you should have a real legitimate doctor. There should be a real legitimate intake. There    
01:27:33.200 should be blood pressure cuffs, there should be heart rate monitors. There should be all the    
01:27:36.680 real things that come with a legitimate practice. And so I want to demystify it a bit. It's going    
01:27:41.920 to be controversial, it's coming out soon. But I think I'm on the right side of history here.    
01:27:47.200 I think that this will help a lot of people. It's not for everyone, but if you're really,    
01:27:52.240 really suffering and you tried everything else, all the exercise, all the antidepressants,    
01:27:56.800 and you still want to do harm, maybe consider.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for suicidal ideation. I mean,    
01:28:03.520 there are many resources that we could recommend.    
01:28:09.320 We're not doctors.Kevin Rose: I mean,    
01:28:10.231 this one is that hit you personally.Tim Ferriss: We're not doctors. We're    
01:28:11.520 not medical doctors. Yeah. I almost off’d myself in college. I mean, if you search “some practical    
01:28:15.480 thoughts on suicide” and my name, there will be a long post that will walk you through my    
01:28:20.080 history with this. But if someone's contemplating self-harm, serious self-harm, then I do think    
01:28:27.760 of all the interventions I've seen in clinic, that's the operative term. Ketamine sessions,    
01:28:38.480 whether IV or intramuscular, are very interesting.They effectively hit stop or pause on the thought    
01:28:47.800 loops so that you can have a moment of respite to really examine what is happening and going on    
01:28:54.400 and take a short break from your pain in the form of these thought loops that are incessant.    
01:29:00.520 And that is also the reason why in my opinion, you should not use ketamine outside of clinic.   
01:29:08.348 Kevin Rose: 100 percent.Tim Ferriss: It is too seductive.    
01:29:10.640 It is very easy to become addicted if you have any history of using alcohol to take    
01:29:19.200 the edge off. Ketamine is like alcohol times 100 in terms of its effectiveness of taking    
01:29:23.680 that edge off. And therein lies the danger because there are severe consequences to    
01:29:29.000 becoming really addicted to ketamine.Kevin Rose: I will say this,    
01:29:31.040 that was really interesting. I talked to Dr. Jen, who's done hundreds of patients    
01:29:34.280 now. And I said to her on the podcast and her defense, this was very interesting. I said,    
01:29:39.720 "For me, I don't see how anyone could be addicted to this because it's like    
01:29:43.600 a journey you go on." And by the time I'm done with the journey, I'm like, oh my God,    
01:29:47.480 thank God I get a few days off because you do it twice a week for three weeks.   
01:29:51.480 But she goes, "No, no, no. Kevin, I just want to let you know there are some people that when    
01:29:56.360 they feel that, they feel high from that." And I'm not one of those people, thank God,    
01:30:00.760 but she's like, "Therein lies the danger." And I'm like, "Thank you for correcting me there."    
01:30:06.640 That's a real legitimate person that is trying to set the record straight because some people    
01:30:11.040 can get that alcohol times 1,000 and get addicted and then they go finding street sources and all    
01:30:16.600 that stuff. But so it's a really crazy compound because in some settings it can be a savior and a    
01:30:24.120 reboot that people need and an outside perspective to look at themselves, disassociated a bit to    
01:30:29.280 laugh and to take the edge off.Tim Ferriss: To take an    
01:30:31.800 observer status on their own stories.Kevin Rose: Observer status, exactly. I    
01:30:34.560 talk about that. Actually when they filmed me coming out of it, they go,    
01:30:38.120 "What did you feel?" And I go, "Kevin was over here. I took an observer status of that. And I    
01:30:43.760 was able to say he's being crazy and he's his own worst enemy." And so it's very challenging because    
01:30:52.280 in some sense this is a very dangerous compound. But I don't think we need to just throw it away.   
01:30:58.267 Tim Ferriss: No, we don't need to demonize it. I think it's a very powerful tool. And the risk is    
01:31:05.240 self-administration.Kevin Rose: Yes.   
01:31:07.040 Tim Ferriss: 100 percent. And I will say I've seen some of the most impressive, amazing, soulful,    
01:31:14.760 high-functioning people completely derail their lives using ketamine and other compounds. And    
01:31:22.360 you just have to be very, very cautious. Because my belief is, and I think this is a, even if it's    
01:31:26.840 inaccurate, I think it's a constructive positive belief to hold. Which is everyone has a molecule    
01:31:34.600 that will make them addictive, everyone.Kevin Rose: Yes.   
01:31:37.387 Tim Ferriss: You just don't know exactly which key is going to fit the lock, but everyone has    
01:31:43.240 the potential to be addicted.Kevin Rose: Did I take —   
01:31:45.347 Tim Ferriss: And it's just the right molecule. So for me, I'm like, let's safeguard against    
01:31:48.520 that. Oh, my God.Addison: [inaudible].   
01:31:52.828 Kevin Rose: What is this?Addison: This is just a single shot of that.   
01:31:55.267 Tim Ferriss: Oh, the great whiskey, or the great tequila. Thank you.   
01:31:57.348 Kevin Rose: All right. Thank you. Thanks so much.Tim Ferriss: I love that text was from like 20    
01:32:00.080 minutes ago. He said thank you. Addison, you're the best, man.   
01:32:03.734 Addison: Sure.Kevin Rose: Thanks man.   
01:32:04.280 Tim Ferriss: PicStudio.AI for Tim in Speedos.Addison: Wait. Did you already pull it up?   
01:32:08.347 Tim Ferriss: I pulled it up.Kevin Rose: It was so good. Amazing. Crazy.   
01:32:10.907 Tim Ferriss: I mean, it looks just like him.Kevin Rose: It does look just like him.   
01:32:14.047 Addison: Here's —Tim Ferriss: What's the story of    
01:32:14.640 the snake through the skull on your forearm?Addison: It's traditional. There's no stories,    
01:32:19.360 man. It's a piece of great art.Kevin Rose: There's no stories. Just beautiful.   
01:32:21.507 Tim Ferriss: All right. You know what? I stand corrected. I like it.   
01:32:23.120 Addison: Hold on, hold on. What about this one? There's no story with the —   
01:32:25.947 Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah, like the monkey in the hat with the cigar?   
01:32:30.232 Kevin Rose: He was [inaudible] —Tim Ferriss: That looks pretty traditional too.   
01:32:31.480 Addison: How about this little baby?Tim Ferriss: Oh, look at like the CCP    
01:32:34.640 baby with the boxing gloves? Yeah. Who knows?Kevin Rose: Addison's the best. Thank you so much.   
01:32:39.940 Addison: Did you guys talk about just what happened last week or    
01:32:42.600 two weeks ago with Flux and the model?Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah. So we did mention    
01:32:44.991 that up front, but I think we should mention it. Well, I didn't mention    
01:32:45.720 Flux. So there was a new model that came out.Tim Ferriss: All right. Addison, you get to do    
01:32:48.760 the cheers. What should we cheers to?Addison: To our girlfriends    
01:32:52.080 and our wives, may they never meet.Kevin Rose: "To our girlfriends and our wives,    
01:32:57.800 may they never meet," is what Addison says.Tim Ferriss: Future tense for me,    
01:33:01.680 but a boy can dream.Kevin Rose: So just to give    
01:33:04.440 the round out of the 30 seconds. Addison, you switched to a new model called Flux.   
01:33:08.140 Addison: Yeah, everyone knows about it. That's deep in the AI space.   
01:33:11.628 Kevin Rose: Yeah, this is the new AI shit.Addison: What's really crazy is,    
01:33:15.080 so you guys brought up —Tim Ferriss: Should we get him a mic?   
01:33:18.108 Kevin Rose: Yeah. Yeah. Here, talk in this mic. Kneel down for a sec. Take a knee.   
01:33:22.520 Just tell us about Flux because the pictures of Tim are insane. Why are    
01:33:26.000 they better now than they were three months ago?Addison: Sure. Well, you guys originally brought    
01:33:30.040 up Prompt Hunt like maybe two years ago now, or maybe a year and a half ago. It was in December    
01:33:35.960 of 2020. You look good. That's not even AI.Tim Ferriss: I do.   
01:33:39.951 Addison: That's our trip to Mexico. It's so good.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, that's just Mexico.   
01:33:42.920 Addison: No. So you guys brought it up and you were making all these theories about    
01:33:49.000 what's going to happen with AI. And really, the models just keep getting better and the    
01:33:55.720 prompts are kind of still staying complicated.And so essentially there was a team at Stable    
01:34:02.200 Diffusion or Stability AI. Those folks left and basically started another open source model.    
01:34:08.920 And this thing is competing with Midjourney and it's all open source. And it launched and    
01:34:15.800 the day or the couple days after it launched, everyone was saying, "You won't be able to fine    
01:34:19.440 tune. You won't be able to train basically these lores and things like that." 24 hours    
01:34:23.880 later, I was like, "Actually, you can."Kevin Rose: And that's how rapidly this changes.   
01:34:27.147 Tim Ferriss: Sounds like AI.Addison: It's just insane. And it takes very    
01:34:29.880 little effort now to train these models.Tim Ferriss: We'll put a bunch    
01:34:31.280 of these up. They're nuts.Kevin Rose: Let me ask you a question on this.   
01:34:33.667 Tim Ferriss: Also, I feel like we're going to put these up and then people are going    
01:34:35.720 to meet me in person and be like, "What happened? You really let yourself go."   
01:34:39.508 Kevin Rose: Hold on, this picture of Tim with the red Speedo type stuff.   
01:34:42.880 Addison: Just pull the AI photos up.Kevin Rose: Exactly. Nice way to get    
01:34:47.480 on Tim's good side. Could you say I want him in a black jacket here, red pants?   
01:34:52.400 Addison: Yeah. Yeah. So the way, what I'm working on with like PicStudio.AI    
01:34:53.589 is essentially everyone wants really —Speaker 1: I'm going to edit this part    
01:34:53.669 out. But do you want to go a little bit more over here so we can see your face?   
01:34:53.748 Kevin Rose: There we go.Addison: I mean, sure.   
01:34:53.794 Kevin Rose: Come more this way.Addison: I want to get my good side. Shit.   
01:34:53.867 Tim Ferriss: Just sit on Kevin.Kevin Rose: [inaudible] editing.   
01:34:54.779 Tim Ferriss: You can just sit on Kevin's lap if you want.   
01:34:57.040 Addison: I'm not saying that's hot, but if the boner police were around, I'd demand a lawyer.   
01:35:02.667 Tim Ferriss: That's definitely staying in.Addison: Shut up. [inaudible].    
01:35:07.800 Okay. [inaudible], Jesus.Kevin Rose: [inaudible] my toothbrush.   
01:35:13.200 Addison: You're going to have to catch up.Tim Ferriss: Oh, God,    
01:35:15.680 you're kneeling on his Fleshlight.Addison: They should make adapters    
01:35:18.840 for this. This would be amazing.Kevin Rose: Multiple adapters.   
01:35:21.367 Tim Ferriss: Okay.Addison: There you go. Sorry.   
01:35:22.120 Kevin Rose: Tell us how we can modify this.Addison: Well, no, the way I've seen this sort    
01:35:26.040 of working in a way that is actually usable, which is what I keep telling people, is how many times    
01:35:30.320 have you taken head shots where you just need them from either LinkedIn or a show that you're working    
01:35:34.800 on? It's just a really —Kevin Rose: Dating.   
01:35:37.160 Addison: Yeah, I'd hate to be dating right now. That'd be really bad.   
01:35:39.781 Tim Ferriss: Yeah, me too.Addison: But you can do anything. Really,    
01:35:41.920 essentially what we're trying to do is figure out what kind of photos people want.   
01:35:45.760 Kevin Rose: [inaudible].Tim Ferriss: Wait, wait,    
01:35:47.280 go to the website for a second.Kevin Rose: Oh, there you go.   
01:35:49.556 Tim Ferriss: What's the tagline? Pro portraits created with AI.   
01:35:52.080 Addison: We're making a whole bunch of stuff. And these are actually old    
01:35:54.720 ones because we're sort of piloting this right now of these different portraits.   
01:35:58.222 Tim Ferriss: God, that's fabulous.Addison: Those are old versions of our portraits.   
01:36:01.757 Tim Ferriss: That is so nuts. Wow.Addison: But I see it less being, "Hey, I want    
01:36:03.880 to be riding an elephant going crazy." It's more like I used to take portraits every year with my    
01:36:09.920 buddy Nate Taylor, who took your portraits by the way. And we'd have to spend a day or two taking    
01:36:15.240 these photos and he doesn't want to do it. I don't want to do it. He's going to take 1,000 photos and    
01:36:19.960 maybe one looks good? And it's like this is just going to get it right right away. So it's just a    
01:36:25.040 realistic way of getting a great portrait.Kevin Rose: I love it.   
01:36:27.947 Addison: But you can do whatever. I absolutely did that and that's going to my library.   
01:36:33.228 Kevin Rose: Your private stash.Addison: [inaudible].   
01:36:36.867 Tim Ferriss: Bookmarks. Tax returns 2011.Kevin Rose: I think I'm going to make    
01:36:40.400 it OnlyFans for Tim. I'm going to make it OnlyFans for Tim based solely on this AI model.   
01:36:45.872 That's an interesting thing. All right.Tim Ferriss: That's true. I can cheat.    
01:36:45.950 You all right over there?Tim Ferriss: I'm good.    
01:36:45.998 Microphone went for a wobble.Kevin Rose: I love Addison. He's    
01:36:47.240 the best. He's always dabbling. This is a one-person startup that he did on his own.   
01:36:51.585 Tim Ferriss: I fucking love that, though.Kevin Rose: Yeah, I know. It's so cool.   
01:36:53.160 Tim Ferriss: Dabbling is where you find things to double down on.   
01:36:56.508 Kevin Rose: Yes.Tim Ferriss: Right?    
01:36:58.280 That's where all the magic happensKevin Rose: 100 percent. All right, I'm out    
01:37:02.000 of good stories. You got anything else? You good?Tim Ferriss: You've got good stories. I think    
01:37:06.320 I've covered most of it on my list. I'll mention a few things. There's a children's book for adults.   
01:37:12.706 Kevin Rose: A trildren's.Tim Ferriss: You all right?   
01:37:14.468 Kevin Rose: You said trildren's. Children's.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, a children's. Children    
01:37:18.680 apostrophe S, a children's.Kevin Rose: Children's.   
01:37:21.907 Tim Ferriss: Yes.Kevin Rose: Okay.   
01:37:23.520 Tim Ferriss: Maybe it's Long Island coming out.    
01:37:25.080 I don't know. I think that's how you say it.Kevin Rose: It's called the tequila coming out.   
01:37:27.560 Kevin Rose: Oh, Lordy.Tim Ferriss: Called The Well    
01:37:29.800 of Being by Jean-Pierre Weill, I guess, if you're going to say it in German.   
01:37:34.508 Kevin Rose: All right.Tim Ferriss: And this has made    
01:37:38.640 an impact on me. It's a beautiful book. It's very easy to read. You could read it with your kids.    
01:37:43.960 And the couple who introduced me to this are one of the most thoughtful, present and playful    
01:37:49.240 couples I know. F. And K., thank you for all this. They've also infused the raising of their    
01:37:56.480 daughters with the ethos of this book in a way.So here's the description. "The Well of Being    
01:38:01.520 from Jean-Pierre Weill is an illustrated inquiry into the art of happiness and what it means to    
01:38:06.200 be radically alive in our daily moments." I'll stop there. It's a long description.   
01:38:10.428 Kevin Rose: It's out of print.I'm on Amazon right now. It's out of print.   
01:38:13.242 Tim Ferriss: Is it really?Kevin Rose: Yeah. And so I    
01:38:13.800 had to just buy a used copy.Tim Ferriss: Buy a used copy.    
01:38:16.440 It's a beautiful book.Kevin Rose: Okay.   
01:38:18.067 Tim Ferriss: And then separately, there's a question that I've been asking myself a lot,    
01:38:21.360 and you can find this more elaborated upon on my blog, takes two or three minutes. But don't freak    
01:38:30.160 out because the first few paragraphs of the blog post. But it's a strong metaphor. And the question    
01:38:35.680 is, are you hunting antelope or field mice? And I've been thinking about this with the podcast    
01:38:41.040 as well as with respect to next projects, how I choose next projects. Because all we have is    
01:38:45.560 our energy and time. And if you spend it in one place, you can't spend it in another. And this    
01:38:52.960 particular question, people can look it up for the history. Are you hunting antelope or field mice is    
01:39:03.360 a reference to sort of the metaphor of the lion. A lion can survive on field mice, but it's going    
01:39:09.920 to ultimately be very, very, very, very, very over busy. And it's going to burn more calories than it    
01:39:15.720 earns through hunting field mice.Kevin Rose: So it'd be skinny.   
01:39:18.667 Tim Ferriss: Don't be skinny, but pick a big —Kevin Rose: No, it would be skinny    
01:39:22.120 if it was just doing field mice.Tim Ferriss: Yeah. But pick a big,    
01:39:24.400 audacious goal that can feed you for a long time. So as you're being    
01:39:29.760 "busy," are you hunting field mice or antelope?Kevin Rose: Can I challenge that for a second?   
01:39:36.947 Tim Ferriss: Challenge.Kevin Rose: So if you're    
01:39:38.440 hunting field mice, I'm assuming that's easier prey, easier to get, probably gives you more    
01:39:45.880 time to sit with who you are.Tim Ferriss: Watch Netflix.   
01:39:50.880 Kevin Rose: The one thing that struck me about today, and let's have a little real    
01:39:55.000 talk for a second at the end.Tim Ferriss: Oh, wow. Oh,    
01:39:56.400 God. Coming to Jesus moment. Here we go.Kevin Rose: No, but you went on this sabbatical    
01:40:01.320 and yet you had to write a book. It's funny —Tim Ferriss: I didn't have to write a book.   
01:40:06.103 Kevin Rose: Well hold on, hold on. Our mutual friend —   
01:40:08.347 Tim Ferriss: Oh, boy.Kevin Rose: — who shall not be named,    
01:40:11.320 pointed this out as well. Where it's like, can you sit and just be you? Or would that be too hard?   
01:40:20.354 Tim Ferriss: Okay, let's do it. All right. So yeah, this is good. Let's get into the    
01:40:22.720 fucking chewy bits. So I routinely, every year, spend at least a month off the grid.    
01:40:31.280 Last October I was gone. I was off the grid.Kevin Rose: Yeah, but you were doing shit.   
01:40:36.027 Tim Ferriss: I was doing stuff, but here's my question, right? And this was in our shared    
01:40:39.960 text thread. I basically said, "Okay, look." So the accusation is that Tim doesn't know how    
01:40:45.600 to chill out. I'm like, "Okay, fine." Let's take that as true. If Tim were to chill out,    
01:40:52.560 what does that look like on a daily and weekly basis? And one of my challenges was humans are    
01:40:57.680 built to be social. You have a family. Our mutual friend has a family. There's an inbuilt social    
01:41:05.720 network in that family. I don't have that. So my —Kevin Rose: I mean, you're a brother to me,    
01:41:12.320 so you always have a family.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I appreciate    
01:41:14.680 that. And on a day-to-day basis, when I wake up in the morning, my hotel room,    
01:41:18.640 my house is empty. So I need to go externally. I need to travel outside of the confines of my house    
01:41:25.240 to find that human interaction.Kevin Rose: Sure.   
01:41:28.787 Tim Ferriss: So the question is, okay, well if you could write the script,    
01:41:34.640 what would Tim Ferriss chilling out look like?Kevin Rose: I know what that would look like.   
01:41:38.547 Tim Ferriss: What would it look like?Kevin Rose: Oh, it's very simple.   
01:41:40.667 Tim Ferriss: All right.Kevin Rose: I've got the    
01:41:41.480 best answer for you ever.Tim Ferriss: Oh, boy.   
01:41:43.588 Kevin Rose: No script.Tim Ferriss: That sounds    
01:41:46.240 like some fucking fortune cookie stuff that I can't make sense of though. What does that mean?   
01:41:49.148 Kevin Rose: I know you can't make sense of it, but that's the point. It's no script.   
01:41:53.240 Tim Ferriss: When have you done that?Kevin Rose: When I did my meditation    
01:41:56.240 retreats. When I do, there's no script.Tim Ferriss: But you had a schedule for each day.   
01:42:00.668 Kevin Rose: Sure. But I think —Tim Ferriss: That was an    
01:42:02.960 intensive silent treatment —Kevin Rose: Okay, okay. [inaudible].   
01:42:04.347 Tim Ferriss: Where you're meditating eight hours a day.   
01:42:06.980 Kevin Rose: Okay, I suffer from the same thing you do. I suffer from the same thing    
01:42:10.120 you do. And that is, that we can't —Tim Ferriss: But there's a reason    
01:42:13.080 we're all friends. We're all fucking border collies chewing on the couch.   
01:42:16.308 Kevin Rose: We can't turn it off. And it's like, honestly, I think the healthiest thing though    
01:42:22.840 would be to wake up with no agenda for a month, with no friends for a month. With the fact that    
01:42:29.080 you just wake up saying, "What is today going to bring?" And that is damn fucking hard for people    
01:42:35.200 that are driven like you and me are.Tim Ferriss: So I did that    
01:42:36.920 for almost a month last October.Kevin Rose: But you did some psychedelics    
01:42:39.920 during that time and shit. Come on, you did shit.Tim Ferriss: Towards the end. But in that    
01:42:43.960 particular case, I mean, I'll just say that I don't think humans are built    
01:42:47.760 for isolation and they're —Kevin Rose: Agreed. Agreed.   
01:42:50.027 Tim Ferriss: And there is a fetishizing of self-sufficiency and independence in the US that    
01:42:55.720 I think is unhealthy. It exists in other places for sure. But if you look at our evolutionary    
01:43:01.520 biological, like our biological programming completely refutes that. To be exiled, to be    
01:43:08.440 excluded from the group, is effectively tough.Kevin Rose: 100 percent. And I'm not arguing    
01:43:12.720 that. But what I'm arguing is what if you couldn't    
01:43:14.280 touch a pen or a computer for a month?Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I'd shoot arrows or a bow.   
01:43:20.468 Kevin Rose: Yeah.Tim Ferriss: I mean, I do think,    
01:43:21.920 and I can't remember the particular attribution of this. Man, I wish I could really remember it.   
01:43:27.280 Kevin Rose: Ron Jeremy?Tim Ferriss: The Hedgehog. No,    
01:43:32.320 it was someone else. But it was basically like man finds leisure through the switching from one    
01:43:38.960 activity to another, one compelling activity to another. Something along those lines. And I wish    
01:43:44.800 I had the exact quote and the attribution, but I don't. And this applies obviously cross-gender.    
01:43:49.720 But the point being that I'm not convinced that being idle is a fruitful goal to have.   
01:44:01.640 If you can't sit with yourself for five minutes, that's a problem. But different    
01:44:07.240 people have different constitutions. And for me, for instance, if you look at The 4-Hour Workweek,    
01:44:13.320 So I get rid of, not get rid of, but I automate my whole business, blah, blah,    
01:44:17.720 blah. What do I do? I end up doing tangos six to eight hours a day. But that was not done from    
01:44:23.200 a position of obligation or fear. It was done from a place of enthusiasm and excitement and love.   
01:44:32.828 Kevin Rose: That's different.Tim Ferriss: And that I think is    
01:44:36.320 good medicine. Right?Kevin Rose: Mm-hmm.   
01:44:38.707 Tim Ferriss: So as long as I have the self-awareness to distinguish between something    
01:44:44.160 that is done from a place of fear or guilt or prestige hunger or responsibility or some nebulous    
01:44:53.320 obligation versus the things that enliven me, I think being active is fine as long as I land    
01:44:59.920 in the latter category. For instance, I am doing a lot of archery right now.   
01:45:05.360 Kevin Rose: But —Tim Ferriss: Because I fucking    
01:45:06.640 love it. I am so fed by it. And I'm not saying I'm the world's    
01:45:11.600 best. I certainly am not. But I just find it so meditative.   
01:45:16.840 Kevin Rose: But can I ask you one question?Tim Ferriss: You can ask me three    
01:45:19.880 questions if you'd like.Kevin Rose: Okay. So one of    
01:45:21.840 the things I'm really curious about is, Tim, I respect you so much because of how I've watched    
01:45:28.520 you dissect and assimilate information like no other human I've ever seen on Earth. And    
01:45:35.200 you are able to learn and pick up and go deep on any topic within a matter of minutes or hours or    
01:45:43.320 weeks. You do that quite well.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, thanks.   
01:45:46.468 Kevin Rose: The one thing that is the rounding out of the holistic picture of Tim that I'm curious    
01:45:52.360 if you can ever tap into is the Tim that says, "I can just be without having to go for those things    
01:46:03.520 or having to engage in that type of thinking." That type of pursuit, that type of analyzing.   
01:46:12.200 Darya, my wife is, she's a PhD in neuroscience. And I oftentimes get engaged in intense debates    
01:46:19.560 with her about there where I'm just like, "Chill the fuck out." No, I'm just —   
01:46:23.278 Tim Ferriss: [inaudible].Kevin Rose:    
01:46:26.680 Darya, don't listen this far. But I'm like, I wish with all my friends' balance. And I think    
01:46:35.200 where our mutual friend was trying to get to is like, might you find —   
01:46:38.867 Tim Ferriss: Voldemort.Kevin Rose: Might you    
01:46:40.920 find a little bit more of that side of the house? Because you have the other in spades.   
01:46:45.707 Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, I'll stay with it. I think that balance can    
01:46:49.240 come in a lot of different forms. So the balance is time-bound in the sense that, is it balanced    
01:46:55.760 on a daily basis? Is it on a weekly basis?Kevin Rose: This is you analyzing it though, dude.   
01:47:00.877 Tim Ferriss: No, hold on. Hold on.Kevin Rose: You're analyzing it.   
01:47:00.943 Tim Ferriss: No, it's not. It's finding the right conceptual framework through which to think about    
01:47:05.600 it. And I don't think that's a mistake. I think it's actually very helpful. It depends on how    
01:47:10.400 your mind works. For me though, it's like if I'm super intense for a month and I'm    
01:47:15.560 going 10 out of 10 and then I'm zero out of 10 for a month, that equates to a five/five.    
01:47:23.440 That's for me a certain degree of balance. But if you looked at on the minute to minute, hour    
01:47:29.040 to hour, day to day, it would look very lopsided.Kevin Rose: I know a fantastic app that I would    
01:47:34.120 love to build for you, which would be the Tim-Tim Random app. And you open it up every morning and    
01:47:39.040 it tells you what to do for a month. And it'd be like, today it's like, "What the fuck is this?"    
01:47:42.960 And you'd be like, "Oh, I have to buy a Slip 'N Slide and go down it 20 times?" Just something    
01:47:48.720 where it's just throwing you completely out of your — and you're like, "Wow, I didn't have to    
01:47:53.920 think about it. I didn't have to overanalyze it. It's just a fucking thing I'm going to do."   
01:47:58.227 Tim Ferriss: Well, this is part of the curse of the entrepreneur.   
01:48:01.428 Kevin Rose: But it's also —Tim Ferriss: No, I'm just saying.   
01:48:03.508 Kevin Rose: 100 percent.Tim Ferriss: You know    
01:48:04.360 exactly what I'm talking about.Kevin Rose: I know exactly.   
01:48:05.904 Tim Ferriss: We talked about this. Jesus.Kevin Rose: But also at the same time —   
01:48:09.347 Tim Ferriss: These are your mics.Tim Ferriss: I know these are my mics.   
01:48:11.388 Kevin Rose: But also at the same time, I will say that when you introduce another partner,    
01:48:16.040 it's the dance that's fucking hard, right? Because Darya is very much about    
01:48:21.560 structure and shit where I'm just like —Tim Ferriss: Darya and I are very similar.   
01:48:24.668 Kevin Rose: Very similar.Tim Ferriss: Super similar.   
01:48:26.508 Kevin Rose: Yeah.Tim Ferriss: Love you, Darya.   
01:48:27.388 Kevin Rose: She's you with hair.Tim Ferriss: You're the best.   
01:48:29.148 Kevin Rose: Yeah. But —Tim Ferriss: Kevin doesn't know what he's doing.   
01:48:31.020 Kevin Rose: She has a better body. No offense.Tim Ferriss: I mean you look at my AI Speedos —   
01:48:37.919 Kevin Rose: [inaudible].Tim Ferriss: — I mean, I'm sorry.   
01:48:40.548 Kevin Rose: We've got to shut this off. You got to catch a plane. Okay. Thank    
01:48:42.520 you everyone for tuning into the show.Tim Ferriss: Great to see you, buddy.

01:48:54.720 city for more than a day or two at a time.Tim Ferriss: Yeah, fuck that, seriously.    
01:48:57.680 100 percent agreed.Kevin Rose: So if we can    
01:48:59.360 talk Darya to moving to Austin, that would be done. Seriously.   
01:49:02.627 Tim Ferriss: We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out.   
01:49:04.280 Kevin Rose: All right.Tim Ferriss: Good to see you, buddy.
