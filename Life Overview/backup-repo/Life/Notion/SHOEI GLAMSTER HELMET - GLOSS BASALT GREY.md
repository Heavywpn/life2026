The Shoei Glamster joins the highly acclaimed brand’s J.O. and Ex-Zero helmets to complete their retro-styled line-up. It is a beautiful helmet with a small, sleek shell that is free from much of the clutter you’ll find on modern helmets. But make no mistakes; under the hood this helmet has all of the modern safety features that make Shoei such a well-respected name in motorcycle land.

The Glamster uses Shoei's much lauded Advance Integrated Matrix Plus (AIM) shell design: a composite of 5 layers of fibreglass and organic fibres making for a very strong, slightly flexible helmet. The liner consists of multi-density, shock-absorbing polystyrene, designed to take a punch, big or small. Shoei also incorporated the Emergency Quick Release System in this helmet: paramedics can pull the red tabs at the bottom of the helmet to release the cheek pads and avoid potential neck injuries when removing the helmet in case of an accident.

The EPS liner mentioned above has channels in them that allow airflow throughout the helmet when you open the forehead vent. Additional, mesh-backed vents can be found on the chin bar. Brushed metal side pods keep the visor in place and a rubber seal prevents any water or wind getting in. The visor can be equipped with the included pin-lock insert to stop it from fogging up.

The Glamster is Shoei’s first real attempt at blending modern function with classic form, and they have nailed it. It looks the part and is an absolute joy to wear, being both comfortable and very light. We’re so impressed by this helmet, we might just consider forgiving them for picking such a horrendous name for it!
