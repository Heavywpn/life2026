# The Life-Changing Skill of Emotional Regulation - Dr Marc Brackett

Only one in five adults can name more
than three emotions they feel regularly.
Why do you think that is?
>> Bluntly, I think it's because we don't
have an emotion education. We just
ignore that aspect of our lives.
>> What does that mean? What does an an
emotion education mean?
It means that from preschool to high
school and even when we're in the
workplace or in college, we are building
our emotion skills, you know,
vocabulary. For example, just to give
you one example, I'm going to ask you
right now, what's the difference between
uh anger and disappointment?
>> Anger is fiery.
>> And feels like you're on the front foot.
Mhm.
>> Disappointment
uh for me is the color of and it's the
color of red for me, orangey red. Uh
disappointment is sort of a blue gray
like a dark purple blue gray and it is
it's sort of closed and it feels like
I'm on the back foot. It feels like I'm
sat in a very low couch. Um I'm aware
that's not a particularly precise
definition.
>> You're you're you're you're a creative
type, that's for sure.
um and all beautiful kind of metaphors
and and but like I really want to know
like the psychological definition or
difference between the two.
>> So what do you think?
>> I'll hand that I'll hand that okay the
psychological difference or definition
between the two. Uh functionally anger
is somebody has stepped over a boundary
and you need to exclaim loudly enough to
ensure that they know that they have
crossed some sort of threshold. Uh it's
a kind of like being your own law
enforcement in a way. Uh disappointment
uh is around hopes, expectations, and
those not being met.
>> Maybe
>> you got it. That was much better. That
was great. So disappointing. You know,
you're uh you're on your verge of being
an emotion scientist.
>> Yes.
>> Um so disappointment, unmet
expectations, anger, perceived
injustice. And so I think a lot of
people kind of look at my work and
they're like, you know, whatever. Who
cares that you know the difference
between anger and disappointment or
anxiety and stress or pressure and fear?
But what we say in our research is that
you have to name it to tame it. You got
to label it to regulate it. And often
times, you know, men in particular are
going to come into our offices, you
know, our homes and, you know, act one
way. They're going to behave one way,
kind of a socially appropriate way of,
you know, typically aggression with all
emotions, whether it's disappointment,
frustration, fear, or anxiety. And the
argument that we make is that until
people really know how they feel and why
they feel the way they do, it's
impossible to support them in managing
them,
>> right? Yeah, that does make sense. Okay.
So, what is emotional intelligence?
Like, is that a thing? I remember there
was this whole world of IQ, EQ.
What does emotional intelligence mean?
So at its simplest level, emotional
intelligence is using your feelings
wisely to achieve your goals. Using all
of our emotions wisely, but that's not
specific enough. And the model that I've
worked on is called ruler. So there are
five skills. The first is recognizing
emotions in oneself and others.
understanding the causes and the
consequences of emotions, labeling
emotions precisely, knowing how and when
to express emotions with different
people across cultures, and then finally
the big R, which is my new book, which
is regulating emotions. What do you do
with those feelings? Both your own and
other people's.
>> Okay. So, it is functional. That would
be one way to put it. Like, it has an
outcome. It's not just a thing that
you're imbued with. It's using your
emotions to achieve.
>> Yes, it's goal oriented
>> just like I mean you can have an IQ and
not use it. A lot of people don't. Um
but the same thing applies to your
emotional intelligence. The the
expectation or the idea is that you have
this set of skills and you apply them to
your life so that you make better
decisions, you make you know you have
better relationships, you achieve your
goals in life. Mhm.
>> You know what I show in my research is
that, you know, we like to think that
our creativity and our general
intelligence are the kind of the things
that we need to achieve our goals.
>> But what I've shown is that there are a
lot of obstacles in the creative
process, a lot of obstacles in achieving
our success in life. And if we don't
have the skills to manage the
frustration or the anxiety or the
disappointment, even the most creative
among us don't really achieve the
outcomes.
>> Yeah. I think a lot of people would see
emotions and the utilizing of emotions
as a vector for weakness, not one for
expediting success.
>> Uh
why
why should people tap into emotions at
all? How how are they a performance
enhancer in that way?
Well, I'm going to be provocative and
say based on my research and you know
the work I've done recently, I think
that emotion regulation should actually
be the new definition of success. Um,
and meaning that we think of success as
you got the fancy car, you got the big
house, you have the big career, whatever
it might be. But truthfully, if you
can't manage your emotions and settle
your nervous system, if you can't manage
or support other people as a leader, for
example, in regulating their emotions,
often times the company doesn't do as
well as you might think it could do. And
often times your own mental health
suffers and your goal attainment
suffers. So I think that's a a lot of
people are fighting me on that one. you
know, they think, well, you know, you
know, well, look at I I've done talks
for big Fortune 100 companies and you
know, like look, look at me, Mark. Look
at my office. You think I really need
emotional intelligence? And the first
thing I say to them is like, well, I
interviewed the five people who report
to you and and they don't like you. They
actually hate you. So, you know, maybe
so, you know, maybe you should develop
some emotional intelligence skills and
maybe the company could be even could be
doing even better than it is.
>> Yeah. I uh
what what is you said uh the like the
definition of high performance is
emotional regulation not emotional
intelligence. So let's define terms
what's emotional regulation.
>> So in the hierarchy of emotional
intelligence emotion regulation comes at
the top right it's like all these skills
come together and then it like helps you
kind of to deal with your feelings. And
the way I define it is I have a little
formula that kind of makes me feel
smart. Um it's er
uh emotion regulation
is a set of goals and strategies. So
think about that. You can prevent an
unwanted emotion. Most people don't
think about regulation that way. They
think of, oh, I'm stressed out. I got to
reduce my stress. But no, if you're a
kid in this classroom and you know
you're going to be anxious on Thursday
at the test, let's prepare now for the
test so you're not anxious on Thursday.
>> If you're, you know, a sports person and
you're going out on the track or out,
you know, to do a match. My other
background is I taught martial arts for
25 years. And so uh you know I would
think about all my martial arts students
getting so you know anxious and as soon
as that you know the opponent came on
the mat and I would say to them like
that's not the time to regulate. You got
to regulate way before you even show up
to the match. You got to be preparing
yourself to be present to not be you
know flustered. So there's a prevention
piece to it. There's a reduction piece
to it in the moment. You got to reduce
the feeling. like if you get triggered,
you get activated, you got to mark, take
a deep breath, calm down. I think
another interesting piece of regulation
is initiating emotions. So, as someone
who manages a large team, um I'm always
thinking to myself like, what emotion is
going to best serve the goal of this
meeting? Like, do I want people to be
inspired? Do I want them to be calm? Do
I want them to be kind of like serious?
And then it's my job to create the
emotional climate that aligns with that
to achieve the outcome. I don't think
people think about that very much. The M
in prime, this is an acronym, is
maintain. So, it's like I'm having a
good day. I'm in flow. I'm writing my
book. And all of a sudden, like I get
that email or I get that phone call and
it's like no, like stay away. Like
>> I'm I'm doing I'm really in a great
place right now.
>> And then the E is kind of enhancing
emotions. So, it's a long definition,
but it's a complicated concept. Mhm.
>> So prime is the goals. Prevent, reduce,
initiate, maintain or enhance.
Then the S is strategies.
Thousands of strategies, right? I mean,
walking in nature, taking a deep breath,
shifting your thinking or reappraising,
getting social support. And so emotion
regulation is G plus S. But then there's
another piece of it which is that all of
that varies as a function of the emotion
you're feeling because you need
different strategies for different
emotions. Kind of your personality. I'm
an introvert. I don't know about you.
You seem a little bit more outgoing than
I am. I'm just making that guess. But um
you know at the end of the day like I
had a I had like a 12-h hour day
yesterday and um it was like 900 PM. I
went to a yoga class to relax but the
yoga teacher was so chatty that I had to
leave the class. I mean I hate it's
embarrassing to say I had to walk out of
the yoga class cuz my brain needed I I
was looking forward to that hot yoga
class where I could just like disappear
and instead I had someone like talking
at me for like 45 minutes. I like this
is not good for me. So B, you know,
that's my personality. I know what I
need and that's going to help me choose.
So I said I went for a walk around
Central Park much better. Um, so it's
the emotion, the person, and the
context. You know, right now if I'm
getting anxious, for example, during our
conversation, I can't be like, you know,
hey Chris, you know what? I'm going for
a run. Like, yeah, that's a little
weird. So anyway, I'll leave it there.
>> Yeah, it's a
>> a lot to think about.
>> It's it is a complex topic. That's true.
Why do you think Why do you think so few
of us were ever taught emotional skills
if they are as fundamental as you say?
Even if they're as fundamental
functionally as you say, you know, you
meritocratic, egalitarian, I'm going to
go and get the thing in life.
>> Why why are people not learning these if
if they're so powerful?
>> Yeah, it's interesting. I think it's
historical. I think that people kind of
thought and especially in psychology,
you know, emotions there, you know, it's
not behavior. So, it's not objective.
It's like in your head and you can't
really study it, which we've proven is
not true. But, um, that's one big piece
of it. I think the other piece of it is
that we tend to equate feeling emotions
with being emotional, like hysterical.
And so we almost treat emotions as bad
things to have because you know they
drive you to make bad decisions and
they're make you impulsive and idio
idiosyncratic impulses. Um of course it
wasn't until like the 70s and ' 80s in
research people like Charles Darwin and
other psychologists would say no no no
actually your emotions ensure your
survival.
Think about that like fear is an
adaptive experience. is saying there's a
threat, you know, stay away, protect
yourself. But, um, it's interesting how
it's taken so long for people to kind of
value emotional intelligence.
Yeah. Well, I suppose
it doesn't have great branding. I don't
think like emotions, emotional
intelligence. I don't think I don't
think when you
>> when you talk to people about it,
they're thinking about the importance of
being able to step into their body, work
out what they're feeling. Uh
I think what most people, especially men
in the modern world, would think about
peak emotional capacity would be
something much closer to suppression.
that that or or or um ignorance maybe.
Well, it's true. When I interview and I
do I do a lot of talks for businesses
and uh I was doing one for a bunch of
lawyers recently and I said, "All right,
define emotion regulation. What is it?"
And the first thing they say, it's like
controlling your emotions, you know, and
then they denying it, you know, ignoring
it, suppressing it. I'm like, "No, no,
no. Go back to your groups, redefine
it." But that's that is the mindset. The
mindset is not to feel, which by the way
is biologically impossible. uh which by
the way the more you suppress the more
it's going to show up in stomach
problems in physical health problems and
mental health problems.
>> Suppression is never the answer.
>> Yeah. We got to remember it's about
using our emotions wisely. And your
point is a good one because you know
with men in particular it's like can I
really tell my wife, my partner, my
colleague that I'm anxious?
>> You know there's no way I'm gonna tell
anybody I'm anxious because they're
going to think I'm weak. As a matter of
fact, a father and you know I had a
pretty rough childhood. I had abuse,
unfortunately, a lot of bullying, and I,
you know, I'm 56 at this point. Like,
you know, this is who I am. Like, I'm
I'm good with who I am, and I'm feeling
pretty safe and comfortable, you know,
sharing my own story. But it took me a
while. And these guys that, you know,
often times at my talks, one guy said to
me, you know, Mark, there's no way I
would ever be as vulnerable as you are,
like in front of other people. like
you're sharing about your bullying and
your abuse and your like your anxiety
about the pandemic. And I'm like, well,
did you feel those? Do you know did you
did you have any anxiety during the
pandemic? He's like, yeah, of course I
did. And I said, well, what did you do
about it? He's like, you know, I didn't
talk about it. I drank alcohol.
And um I said, well, maybe there's a
better way. Um, and I really want I'm
I'm very interested actually in the
gender piece of this because there is
this like we have men in particular have
feelings about their feelings.
>> It's like they feel they feel shame that
they're anxious. What do you think about
that?
>> Oh, I I could talk about this for the
rest of my life. I think
uh what I've called second order
emotions, what you've probably got a
much more official name for uh feeling
bitterness at my resentment about my
shame, about my anxiety, this like
infinite regress of thinking about
thinking and my story that I tell myself
about the story that I told myself about
the thing that I felt.
>> Um
appears to happen a lot in the world of
men. And I think the guys I think guys
struggle to find a place where their
emotions that aren't
a very small number. Maybe resentment is
allowed. Maybe anger is allowed. Um
sadness would you would struggle with,
anxiety, you would struggle with uh
grief, you would struggle with fear
would be a real big difficult one as
well. Um because all of those kind of
strike at the heart of the emotional
mastery, competence, conquer, go after
it and get it type thing that
>> I think guys feel like they need to lean
into and in many ways do need to. Um uh
and yeah, trying to blend those two
worlds is um I think I'm probably not a
bad role model for the sort of uh
highly sensitive guy uh at least in my
personal life.
And I'm completely bought in. I'm so you
know I I I can say now because it's been
what 3 days 4 days since I got back. I
did. Do you know who Joe Hudson is? Are
you familiar with Joe?
>> Art of accomplishment. So, um he is
>> he is the um like head of culture at
OpenAI and Okay.
>> I do know what you're talking about now.
Yep.
>> Yeah. I did Groundbreakers last week,
which is uh 9:00 a.m. till 9:00 p.m. for
7 daysish uh of emotional work every
single day. And uh that was the most
vulnerable, difficult,
intense thing that I've ever done uh by
by like quite some margin. And um it
really reframed, I think, my
perspective. I I already was halfway
there, but this really reframed it even
more. My kind of
viewpoint on what real strength looks
like. sort of what what yeah I think
strength is a maybe a good a good
descriptor for it.
>> Denying or suppressing your emotions is
still giving them a lot of power over
you
>> that
>> you you are saying this thing is so
impactful and outside the bounds of my
control and I am at the mercy of it so
much so that I can't engage with it. I
think you could maybe make a similar
sort of argument about somebody that has
a substance abuse problem and um this
person goes cold turkey, hooray,
congratulations. Like you've you've
transcended your need for alcohol or
nicotine or whatever it might be. But
truly like alchemizing that would be
reintroducing the substance on your
terms and only ever needing one of them.
It would be being being able to use it
again. Does that make sense? Do I sound
insane? No, it's great. I mean, it
totally makes sense. I think you're
getting at a lot of things. Number one
is kind of this like I'd rather like
endure the suffering internally than let
anybody know how I'm feeling to get the
support I might need to have a better
life.
>> Yes.
>> Um and I, you know, it's why so many
people get divorced, right? It's it's
why, you know, people don't talk to
their bosses when they want to get a
raise. It's why friendships, you know,
because it's like I'm having this
feeling, whatever it might be, and it's
more painful for me to think about how I
can tell you how I'm feeling and ask for
your support or ask you to maybe change
a little bit. Um, and I I just that is
like beyond my imagination difficult.
And so I'm just not going to do it. But
of course the outcome is always worse
because you would have a better
relationship and better everything if
you were more comfortable talking about
it.
Yeah. So I think when it comes to the
suppression thing,
why
why is emotional suppression still seen
as a strength?
What is it what is it that's
>> Well, I don't think it is.
>> I wouldn't say it's I wouldn't say it's
seen as a strength. I would say it's
easier and so it's you know people
choose that as an option. It's like in
my research what I find the top
strategies that people are kind of used
to not deal with their feelings you know
avoidance big one. It's like I'm just
not going to have the difficult
conversation. I'm just not going to go
home tonight and talk to my significant
other. I'm not going to tell my kids. I
mean parents are even afraid to talk to
their own kids about feelings. It's
crazy.
>> Mhm. U because they're afraid they can't
deal with what they're going to hear
from their own kids. Um so, you know,
the point is that I'd rather kind of not
engage with the emotion. Um because the
pain of what I'm sorry what I was
getting at is avoidance
denial uh overeating
uh drinking too much alcohol uh like you
said suppression you know all of these
become what I would call our automatic
go-to terrible habits for dealing with
our feelings none of them lead to good
outcomes for us they usually lead to
more shame more regret more self-hatred,
the list goes on, and they never help us
with our well-being or having good
relationships or achieving the real
goals we have in our lives.
But the the the new strategies, the
helpful strategies, kind of what I write
about that even the even doing a
mindfulness exercise, which people
sometimes roll their eyes at, we know
that our sympathetic and parasympathetic
nervous systems, right, need support. We
need to deactivate that nervous system
in order to be present, in order to have
the access to cognitive strategies to
deal with our feelings. But oh, that's
that's, you know, I'm not that's fluff.
Breathing, you know, been breathing, you
know, since you came out of the womb.
So, it's probably a good thing. Um, the
cognitive strategies, I mean, think
about how much gaslighting there is in
our world right now. I mean, be let's be
real. People are endlessly gaslit in
terms of, you know, you're not you're
too fat, you're too skinny, you're too
tall, you're too short, you're not big
enough, you're not small enough, you're
too masculine, you're too feminine,
you're too dark, you're too light. I
mean, it's endless.
And you know, how many of us are taught
when we're kids how to like sift through
that kind of judgment and say, "Hey,
wait a minute. You know, you don't have
the right to define my reality. Like, I
actually like myself and like stay
away." You know, how do we how many of
us have learned how to sift through what
people are saying about us to then have
a more positive view of ourselves as
opposed to allowing other people to
define our realities for us?
>> What happens if you don't express an
emotion? You mentioned it earlier on.
Let's say
I I hesitate to point the finger too
much at repression as if it's something
that people chose to do. And in some
ways they
They did, but it's not in the same way
as you chose to push that person into
open traffic. It's more like I'm scared
and wow, this is a lot. And what about
the world outside? And what about the
story I tell myself? And that's
uncomfortable to deal with. Coping
mechanisms and you know, it's a lot of
stuff that's going on that doesn't feel
quite like commission or valition. It's
just a desperate desire to try and
survive. Um,
>> but if somebody continues to do that,
what happens if you don't express
emotions?
>> Well, they be it's like a debt that
keeps on getting bigger and it comes out
somewhere. It comes out, as I said
earlier, in those maladaptive
strategies. It comes out in terms of
avoiding your significant others. It
comes out in drinking too much alcohol.
It comes out in having, you know,
gastrointestinal issues. it comes out
with anxiety disorders and depressive
disorders. I mean, the list goes on
because
we're born to feel and you know, we have
to get those feelings expressed somehow
or another. And if we don't do it,
they're going to find their way out. And
unfortunately for most people, because
they haven't had the emotion education,
it's easier, you know, we learn like I
don't know about you, but my parents
were not like the role models for
emotional intelligence, you know. So,
you know, my father was a tough guy from
the Bronx, and he would say things like,
"Son, you got to tough it up."
>> I'm like, "Dad, look at me." You know,
I'm about as far from a tough guy as you
can get. I have a fifth degree black
belt, but I'm not a tough guy. Um, and
you know, he would say things like, "I
used to beat kids up like you." Okay,
great. You know, they taught you that in
parenting class, right, Dad? Uh, and my
mom, on the other hand, was with a lot
of anxiety and she would say things
like, "I can't take it anymore. I'm
going to have a nervous breakdown. So,
here I am, this like 5-year-old kid,
10-year-old kid in this growing up in
this environment. Like, what am I
learning? I'm learning like anxiety is
weak. People lock themselves in their
bedrooms when they're anxious and you
just sort of like lose yourself in your
anxiety. And I learned get angry at
everything. And and that's pretty much
what I was until, you know, I got my PhD
in psychology. Um, I was, you know, this
anxious, angry person who just like
didn't know what the hell to do with his
feelings.
>> Um, so anyway,
>> let's say that somebody is somebody
resonates with that. Oh, anxious, angry
person who doesn't really know what to
do with his feelings like army of one
>> listening listen listening here with the
AirPods in. uh what is a good framework
for them to follow to begin
including integrating those emotions
more healthfully?
>> Great question. So this is you know what
happened is I wrote this book many years
ago. It's called permission to feel and
it was my argument that we have to give
ourselves and everyone permission to
feel. And uh I'm proud that's been 30
languages now. And you know, a lot of
people understand that like we have the
first step is we got to like give
ourselves that permission. It's like
it's okay to be anxious. It's okay to be
angry. There's nothing bad about it.
Anger's real. Anxiety is real. Like
don't judge it. Just allow it to be. If
you're feeling it for too long and it's
too intense, you got to do something
about it. And then the pandemic hit and
I got trapped in my house um with my
mother-in-law. So, she came to visit
from the country of Panama for two weeks
around March 1st of 2020. And uh little
did we know that there would be a
pandemic. 2 weeks later that she would
stay with us for 7 months. And I'm like
losing it. You know, for me, the morning
is like my kind of precious time. I like
to have my really good cup of coffee. I
like to like have my existential crisis,
like think about my purpose in life.
>> And I like to do that alone. um not with
the my mother-in-law like staring at me.
So, it got really rough. Anyway, we had
this kind of meltdown in the house and
she looked at me and she's like, "Are
you really the director of the Center
for Emotional Intelligence?" And I was
like, "Not tonight, I'm telling you."
And so, it just like the whole thing
blew up. And I share that with you
because here I was like supposedly like
one of the world's experts in emotional
intelligence and emotion regulation. And
I'm like,
you know, rock bottom, like desperate,
disregulated.
But then I, you know, when I went to bed
that night, I thought to myself, you
know, Mark, you actually are the
director of the Center for Emotional
Intelligence. Like, this is your whole
career. You've written 200 papers and
books and all this stuff. Like, you got
to show up. You got to you got to
practice what you preach. And that's in
that moment, I decided to write a book
on emotion regulation. It was like I was
walking down the stairs. I'm like,
"Nobody knows anything about this stuff.
If I don't know it, like then nobody
knows it." And so this new book that I
wrote called Dealing with Feeling is
really the map. And I just I wanted it
to be super practical. Like step one is
you got to shift your belief systems.
There's no such thing as a bad emotion.
Period. There is no such thing as a bad
emotions are like the tide. They come
and go. Sometimes they're unpleasant.
Sometimes they're pleasant. The second
is you got to build the vocabulary. You
got to know the words.
>> Like I'm going to p I'm going to push
you again. So anger and disappointment.
We spent some time on that one a little
earlier. Let's go to the one that
everybody says they're feeling, which is
anxiety.
>> Everybody's anxious these days, which I
don't believe, by the way. Um I think
people say they're anxious, but they're
not actually anxious.
>> Okay. So, anxiety versus stress
versus pressure.
>> You're taking my little test of
emotional intelligence.
>> Oh, you want me to define the difference
between anxiety, stress, and pressure?
>> Yeah, I do.
>> Okay. Anxiety, uncertainty about the
future.
>> You're good.
um stress a concern between our inner
level of capability and the outer uh
demands that the society is placing on
or that the world is placing on us and
uncertainty an uncertainty that we can
deal. I also get the sense that
complexity is in there. Stress is to do
with lots of complexity that's going on.
Velocity complexity um
>> anxiety. What was the other one?
>> Pressure.
>> Pressure. Ooh.
obligation feels like feels like a sense
of obligation as well.
>> You're pretty good. I think you're using
like chat GPT or something.
>> The um So, you anxiety is about
uncertainty around the future.
>> Yes, let's go. 10 out of 10.
>> Stress is having too many demands and
not enough resources.
>> Yes. Yeah. I'm going to give myself 10
out of 10 again. Yeah. And pressure is
something at stake is dependent upon
your action or behavior.
>> Okay. Yeah, that was a little bit off on
that one. Cool.
>> It's all right.
>> That'll do.
>> But why why would I want you to know
like here you are this, you know,
>> guru, you know, why do I want
>> Yeah.
>> Why would I want you to know the
difference between anxiety, stress, and
pressure?
>> Why do I why why would I care?
>> Because we default to the most common
emotion.
uh we we often bundle together
um
different things into a single word and
by doing that lots of things sound like
one thing. So lots of things sound like
anxiety when they might actually be
stress or pressure.
>> Exactly. and what you would do. So,
think about it. I remember when I'm
anxious about something, I tend to say,
"Mark, like you got no control over that
right now." Like, you can think about
that till tomorrow night and it's not
going to change because you have no
power over that. You got to look at it
from a different perspective, you know,
rethink it. That's what I do for
anxiety. For stress, it's either I get
help or I take stuff off my plate. I
don't know what else to do. There's no I
can take all the breaths in the world,
>> but I'm still going to have too much
stuff on my plate. and not enough time
to get it done. And for pressure, it's
like I either got to talk to my boss and
say, "Hey, you know, like this deadline
is it's it's killing me, you know." And
>> interesting enough, you know, I do a lot
of work with college students because
that's where I'm a professor. Yesterday
I gave a speech to 1500 high schoolers,
which was,
>> you know, a little bit challenging. Um,
and I had done some research with them,
and they all said they're stressed out.
Everyone, I'm stressed. I'm stressed.
I'm stressed. But what my research
showed was The number one emotion was
what do you think?
>> Pressure.
>> Envy.
>> Oh, okay.
>> None of the three. They're thinking
they're stressed or they're saying that
they're stressed, but what they're
feeling is that everyone's better
looking than they are. Everyone has
better opportunities than they have.
Everybody studies for less time and gets
better grades. Everybody's parents have
more connections than their parents
have. They're just like it's like this
endless social comparison.
>> And so, but they're calling that stress.
And so, you know, what's the what do you
do with that? You don't take deep
breaths. You don't do meditation. You
got to, you know, and I tell them like,
you got to switch from envy to
gratitude. Like, look at all of you.
You're in a great high school. You're
doing pretty darn good. And you could
just bask in that envy and par make
you'll be paralyzed by it. Or you can,
you know, shift your thinking because I
don't know other any other way to get
out of the envy spiral until you kind of
look at things from a new lens.
>> That's interesting. Take take me through
take me through your process of
alchemizing envy. Somebody looks at
somebody else, the comparison game is
going on in their head. Uh maybe it
comes up as a bit of resentment, maybe a
little bit of bitterness, maybe a little
bit of fear as well. Um, but you know,
if they investigate themselves and
they're truly truly honest, they say
something like, "Ah, I envy that
person." What is a way that they can
um integrate that emotion uh more
effectively?
>> Yeah. I think the reality is if you're
feeling envy, you're feeling envy, you
know. Um I think that the question is is
the why behind it. Is it going towards
admiration or is it going towards
resentment? I envy a lot of people. Like
I look at people giving speech, I'm
like, "God, their timing is great. That
humor is amazing. Their the way their
posture is great, you know, and but I
don't wish they weren't skilled.
I want to like aspire." And so I use it
as a as a learning opportunity. I'm
like, "Okay, wow. If I incorporate that
into my speech, it's going to get even
better."
>> So it's a reframe. You see, it's a
reframe. Mhm.
>> Instead of being bitter and resentful,
I'm thinking, "Oh, I can actually learn
from that person and apply that to what
I do."
>> That's one way to do it, which I think
is really important. The gratitude piece
is is another whole thing, which is, you
know, I teach at Yale. I mean, let's be
real, it's a pretty good university. And
if you got into Yale, you got to be
pretty darn smart. And so, like, when
students are starting to get envious of
the other validictorians, I'm like, can
we take a break here? and just like look
around like you're doing.
>> Yeah, exactly. Let's just like let's you
know let's let's take a moment and like
reflect on where we're at compared to
many other people. Maybe you should just
like wake up and say things, you know,
think about three things that you're
grateful for for being here.
>> And they're not taught to do that. You
know, this is the problem. It's not
their automatic habitual response is
like they're smarter, they're better,
not oh wow, look at me. I've actually
done pretty well in my life or wow, I
should be grateful that my parents
worked their asses off to get me into
this university and supported me or
whatever it might be.
>> I have a question on this again. Uh my
recency bias is like [ __ ] weapons
grade at the moment, right? Because I've
just come back from this this big
retreat which was exclusively about
emotions.
>> Couple of things to tell you
>> uh when it comes to uh discerning
between different emotions. What is this
thing that is inside of me?
>> I really struggled I I realized that I
really struggled to distinguish between
something like frustration or agitation.
>> Mhm.
>> And anger.
>> Um and that I was confusing a lot of the
time. I was angry but I was feeling it
as frustration or agitation and I wasn't
allowing myself because I didn't think
that anger was was safe to move through.
So I I completely agree with it is
important for us to be able to like a
nice sumelier uh detect the different
notes that are constituting whatever the
emotions are that are inside of us
because you don't know how to deal with
it
>> if you don't do that. Uh you also end up
sort of calling yourself you you
self-leabel this thing as oh there's my
anxiety again and you go well maybe it's
not maybe you're pattern matching four
different things as anxiety when it's
not. Um, one of the other things that
happened throughout the week though was
a lot of work about actually getting
into the body and allowing yourself to
feel these emotions. And one of the
problems that I realized, I've I've been
kinda obsessed with emotions over the
last 18 months. I really wanted to be uh
less emotionally decapitated as I was
referring to it, like emotions existed
above the neck.
>> Um, and getting down and being like,
"Okay, what does this mean? How does
this feel? Can I let it move through me?
And I have more emotional fluidity in
that sense like can it come and it goes,
can it come and it goes?
>> Um,
>> how do you think about the limitations
of trying to teach people this stuff
through concepts and words that result
in the um like overinker just having
more to think about? You understand what
I mean? like it it's this this sort of
tactic at least for me until I
>> uh spent more time
>> getting below the neck
>> results in just more apherisms or
mantras or you know how do you think
about combining embodiment with with
cognition?
>> Well, our emotions are a product of
that. Um so they're they're you need
both. You need to be aware of what's
happening in your body in terms of
whether it's heat in your body, whether
it's the arousal or activation in your
body. The problem with that alone is
that it's very misleading. So, for
example, um for years I would like sit
I'm a workaholic and I'd be like 11:00
at night and I'd be like, you know, I'm
anxious and my partner would say, you
know,
why are you anxious? You're just tired.
Shut the freaking computer and go to
bed.
>> And I'd be like, yeah, you're right. I'm
not anxious. I'm just tired. I was
confusing the signals in my body because
they felt the same as when I was
anxious. So, it's important for people
to know that we confuse our body exper
bodily kind of reactions and experiences
for emotions sometimes when they're not
emotions. They're just physical states.
The cognitive piece is important because
it's the only way we can communicate,
right? If you're in therapy or if you're
trying to communicate to your partner,
your whoever what you're feeling, you
need language. And I um actually built
this app that's free that you are going
to love. I promise you. It's called How
We Feel
>> and I was proud to build it with the
co-founder of Pinterest. His name is Ben
Silverman.
>> And uh he and our teams worked together
for two years. Got an award from Apple.
Congrat.
We made it available for free on iOS and
Android. And um it is this tool that we
call the mood meter which is based on
your pleasantness and your levels of
activation and your bodily awareness.
And it breaks into four quadrants. We
got yellow, red, blue and green. So
yellow are high energy pleasant
emotions. I'm excited. I'm elated. I'm
ecstatic. I'm jubilant. I am optimistic.
>> Green I am calm, content, tranquil,
peaceful, relaxed, blissful. I am
serene.
>> Blue, I am down, disappointed,
devastated, hopeless, despared,
depressed.
red. I am anxious, overwhelmed, I am
angry, I am peeved, I am irritated. So,
we've got the full range of emotions,
but it's based on your appraisal of
what's happening in the environment or
in your head and your body. And then we
give you 144 words to describe those
feeling states.
>> So, um, and the definitions of them so
you understand the reason behind it. And
then we also give you an option to check
in with your body and you can locate
where in your body you're feeling this
emotion and then you could track that
over time and see if there's patterns
between how you feel and where it shows
up.
>> How how how I feel.
>> No, how we feel.
>> How we feel. That has 25,000 reviews and
it is five stars on
>> the the app store and it's an editor's
choice. Dude, that's amazing.
Congratulations. What a beautiful I mean
also someone is definitely stealing it
with how I feel uh because it's the same
color profile. So go and go and get them
to uh see this for for passing off. Um
yeah that's wonderful. I uh
again my recency bias is is [ __ ]
potent at the moment because
>> sure I learned all of this new stuff and
it's very exciting to me but it also
feels right. I feel more aligned in that
way. Uh and so I am I'm completely on
board even if uh even if it's it's
through an app.
>> Yeah. I mean it's a it's a it's you know
one thing about the app it's not like
you have to use it for the whole your
whole life because nobody uses any app
for their whole life but it's a training
ground. It's building that awareness.
It's like oh when I'm before I walk into
my office I'm like where am I in that
mood meter? What's causing me to have
that feeling? Oh I'm feeling that way
because of what happened at home. I
don't need to take that out on the
person at work. M
>> that's what I'm trying to get people to
do. But going back to the strategies.
>> So those we've only gotten to two of
like the eight strategies just so you
know. So the first step is as I said
shift your mindset. And the other piece
of the mindset piece by the way is
having kind of a growth mindset about
your ability to regulate. So my father
for example he'd say son like son this
is the way I deal with my anger. You're
going to have to learn how to deal with
it. M
>> okay dad you know I guess you're not
willing to learn anything you know
that's a that's a fixed mindset like
this is my destiny you know this is who
I am which is not true everybody could
learn to regulate better that's proven
so uh you're not born that way so
mindsets language then you got to know
the breathing pieces you got to be able
to deactivate if you can't deactivate
you're toast because if you get
triggered and you can't bring it down,
you're going to result in, you know,
aggression, you know, or um saying
something you regret or just blowing up.
That's the mindfulness breathing work.
But then the cognitive piece, as I
shared earlier, is probably the most
important in the end. You know, so many
people just have such negative views of
themselves. They look in the mirror and
I'm not good enough and I'm not smart
enough and I'm not creative enough and
nobody wants to be around me. And that
just creates a spiral into, you know,
total despair. I don't know where in our
childhoods we're taught to be
self-compassionate.
Not in a in a in a fluffy way, but
literally
saying like, how do I say, Mark, you can
get through this, Mark, you're strong
enough, Mark, guess what? This feeling
of terror that's going through your
brain right now is actually impermanent.
You will not feel this way. There are
rainy days. There are sunny days. Today
is the rainy day. Tomorrow is going to
be a sunny day. All that cognitive work
that we have to engage in to really help
us have more positive outlooks.
The third or not the third, but whatever
we're on now, I just I know them in
terms of what they are, but um is
I don't think any of us should ever have
to worry alone.
Why? Like why do we have to feel alone
with our fears and anxieties? Of course,
if I'm traveling and I'm in the airport
and the flight gets canceled, I'm pissed
off. Mark, you got to like deal with
this. But in everyday life, you know, we
we we're built to be social creatures.
And so, I've done a lot of research on
this. Actually,
take a guess. What are the top three
characteristics
of the people that we're just desperate
to be around?
>> H what would you give me an example of a
characteristic that isn't in there? just
so that I know they're sort of
>> uh smart,
>> right? Okay. Okay.
>> Which is interesting that it's not in
there.
>> Um
attentive or curious, something like
pro-social. Their their attention is
focused on us in a way.
>> Mhm.
>> Uh regulated or peaceful, something in
that kind of realm. Uh the the the
person is uh not volatile would be
another way maybe to say it. Um,
the third one,
>> I would have said smart. I would have
said smart. So, I'll give you I'll give
you two two of mine.
>> Interestingly enough, smart never shows
up. I've studied this with 25,000
people. Maybe like three people, four
people. in terms of the people that we
want to be around in terms of like
especially when it comes to being
supported by them. There's three core
characteristics
>> and I've shown this now cross-culturally
uh both from the US to England to Spain
to Italy to Australia to Hong Kong to
Costa Rica.
>> No cultural differences.
Number one,
non-judgmental.
>> Okay. Yep. We just we're everybody's
just kind of burnt out from the judgment
in our society. Just can I just be
myself? Can you just let me be who I
want to be? Number two, good listener.
We're dying to be around people who just
listen, but not listen to like
retaliate, but listen to kind of help
you gain perspective. And the third is
just empathy and compassion.
Think about that. I mean, imagine if we
had a society where we were kind of like
striving to have a people who were
non-judgmental, who were good listeners,
who showed empathy and compassion. I
mean, I don't know. I want to live in
that world, to be honest with you.
>> Yeah. It's how funny that those are all
very soft skills, I think you would say.
Um,
>> uh, not in the typical form of the word,
but they are soft traits, right?
>> They're social and emotional.
>> Yeah. They're gentle, they're nurturing,
they're reassuring. Um,
and yet when we look at what are the
sort of traits that people try to
develop, it's their charisma, their
brashness,
uh, their wittiness, you know, their
quickness with words.
>> Um,
>> and that that appears to not be
>> the thing. There's this uh I I I kind of
got obsessed with an idea similar to
this from uh the school of life Aland
Botton's thing and uh he has this idea
that um some people are interesting,
some people make us feel interesting and
we tend to want to be around the latter
more than the former.
>> I he's just such a wonderful inverse
charisma you could call it, right? Um
>> totally other oriented.
>> Other oriented. That's nice. Yeah. Here
for hey, just there's room for you.
There's room for you in this
conversation. Like bring it on. That's
cool. Exactly.
>> I'm going to sit here. I'm not going to
judge. I'm going to be with you. And
this is really, really similar to the uh
view framework that Joe has from Art of
Accomplishment. That's vulnerability,
impartiality,
>> um empathy, and wonder.
>> So,
uh
>> vulnerability, uh saying what's true
even when it's scary, impartiality, not
trying to change the other person.
Empathy, sitting in the emotion without
being captured by it. and wonder, uh,
inquisitiveness without an outcome. So,
like curiosity but not needing the
answer, so to speak. Yeah.
>> And, uh, it seems to me like your 25,000
person cohort would that would slot
together with
>> it's very similar
>> pretty nicely. Yeah.
>> What's interesting though is that the
research that I do goes from childhood
to adulthood. And what I look at is did
you grow up with that? Like, did you
grow up with someone in your life who
created the conditions for you to be
your true self? And what I find is that
only about a third of people say yes.
Twothirds of people say no. There was
nobody when I was growing up.
>> They was non-judgmental.
>> So, it's not like they learned this in
childhood or something. They didn't
pattern match. I once had a supportive
parent and then I want that in
adulthood.
>> No. As a matter of fact, going back to
the male female thing,
of the people who say yes to they they
had the person, half of them say it was
a parent. So like say a third, so it's
like what? 17%
>> say it was a parent. Of that 17%, only
2% say it was their dad.
>> Oh wow.
>> Yeah.
>> Wow.
>> Nobody's nobody's thinking about their
dads as a non-judgmental
listener.
I wonder, you know, me and a lot of the
the guys last week were talking about um
whether there is going to be some sort
of pattern shift from the boomer
generation to sort of whatever
millennial Gen Z parenting with the
ascendancy of
>> podcasts and courses and embodiment work
and emotional awareness and stuff like
that. um you know breaking some of those
uh welltrodden generational cycles of
sort of how specifically men uh show up
for their kids and and the sort of
community around them and stuff like
that. Uh I would like to think that
maybe if you were to do this again in
another 15 20 years that maybe you'll
start to see some pockets grow up of
yeah dad was
>> he did feel more comfortable about
showing up in an unjudgmental way. um
the the uh fragile male ego had been
alchemized somewhat. But uh maybe not.
Maybe maybe we're just maybe this is
just fresh packaging on the same like
patterns, the same non-showing up
patterns. I don't know.
>> I mean, I'm working on it. You know, I
have I do a lot of work in companies,
but my a big part of my career is doing
this work in school systems. And so I
have a program called Ruler that's in
5,000 schools across the United States.
And I think I'm raising a bunch of, you
know, I call them Uncle Marvin's cuz
Uncle Marvin was my hero in my life.
>> And uh he was the person who gave me the
permission to feel. And so uh I like to
think, you know, what do we do to create
a world filled with people who have
these characteristics? That's kind of my
vision and hope. But that's, you know,
that's a piece of it. And so we've gone
from mindsets to language to kind of
deactivating our nervous system to
having the selft talk that's productive
instead of destructive to having these I
call them emotional allies
um meaning our the people that we can
share and talk to talk you our emotions
with um and then there is the piece that
a lot of athletes are really
knowledgeable about it's the sleep
habits it's the nutrition it's the
physical activity
We know those three things directly
correlate with our ability to regulate
emotions effectively. And I think a lot
of people misunderstand that. They
think, "Oh, it's about my health." No,
no, no. If you don't get good quality
sleep, you're going to lose it in the
morning with your kid.
>> You're just not going to have
replenished. And the, you know, emotion
regulation takes effort.
>> And so, if you don't have the the time
to rejuvenate, you're going to have a
much shorter fuse. And the final thing
that I really help people do uh in my
book is I want them to imagine
that they have an identity
as someone who is well regulated
and I stole this from a personal
trainer.
>> Okay.
>> Um and stealing it is not the right way
but I got the idea from him. So during
the pandemic, I decided I'm going to,
you know, I going to get fit again and I
met this guy named Marco and online
fitness expert. And uh and I, you know,
I was never I was a martial artist. I
was very athletic but not a
weightlifter. I decided that I'm going
to become a dude. I'm going to lift
weights. And so
this process of going from you know I'm
a 50-year-old psychologist why am I
doing deadlifts you know like really
like I had so much negative selft talk I
was like this is ridiculous like why am
I doing this like I'm I've been married
for 27 years like who cares what my body
looks like and it was like that was the
first phase of getting rid of the
negative selft talk right then the
second phase was
wow I'm actually enjoying this I I I see
a difference. This is cool. Like got
some definition. But by about two years
into it, I could not not work out.
Like I even today, like at this point,
it's been like 5 years now and I have a
little app and I work at like I have to
do my four workouts a week and I'm like
irritable and like antsy if I don't get
that work in workout in. And I think
it's because
>> I now identify as someone who lifts
weights. Just part of my identity.
My vision is that we can apply that in
our society to emotion regulation.
That if we had people walking around
saying like, you know, I ident I'm I'm
this is like I'm a master at managing
emotions.
>> Like think about if you were triggered
by someone, it'd just be like the Yoda
of emotional intelligence.
Whatever. You can't you can't harm me.
>> My god.
>> So that's my vision. I don't know. What
do you think about that? I I certainly
think that when you begin to identify as
something, it's a powerful route to uh
reinforcing all of the habits that come
below it.
>> Um I think yeah, I people identify with
an emotion. I am an anxious person. I am
an irritable person. I have a short
fuse. I tend to be really excitable. I
tend to be very enthusiastic. I get sad
quickly. Um but not the meta skill of I
have emotional fluidity. Emotions for me
they come and go. Uh I am able to sit
with em I am brave with my emotions.
Right? Which is an interesting kind of
meta skill to think about that. That was
something else that I learned last week.
Um the the kind of bravery that you need
to be able to actually feel an emotion
is way more bravery than it takes to
suppress one.
>> Correct.
>> Like
>> and I like you know we
>> go.
>> No. No. Um, I like where you were going
a little while ago, which is that for
somehow or another we've accepted in our
society like I'm an anxious person and
then it's like, oh, oh, oh, you know, I
understand. Firstly, that's not true.
Like you're not, you know, you're you're
whole, you know, body composition and
your DNA is not an anxious person. You
know, you are feeling anxiety. It's an
experience that you're having. So that
distance from the emotion is important
>> because it will create a self-fulfilling
prophecy.
>> You know just you'll just you'll
everything that you do in life you will
see through that lens. Well why don't we
give people the skills they need and
then they can identify as guess what you
know yes I'm going to have anxiety. Yes
I'm going to have fear. Yes I'm going to
feel depressed if I don't get the job I
wanted. But it's not the end of my life.
It's not the end of the world. I can
reframe. I can try this. I can do this.
And I feel
like we're just it's that's going to be
it's it's a battle that I'm fighting
right now in our society
because um there are a lot of people by
the way who don't think this should be
taught. They're thinking keep this out
of schools, keep this out of you know
companies that this is not something
that should be discussed or talked about
which is also
uh a huge issue for me.
>> Why do you think they say that?
I think it's a number of reasons. Um,
one is that I think some parents believe
that like I should be in control of what
my kid learns about feelings. Um,
>> but not what they learn about maths or
history.
>> Right. Exactly. Exactly.
And I think it's because
there's a fear base, you know, that, you
know, that their kid is going to be told
what their values are or the kid is
going to be told what they should be
doing. when the truth is in our work
which is you know again in 5,000 schools
it's far from that it's you know I know
from the research across all populations
what works to help people regulate their
emotions why I wrote a book on how to
deal with your feelings and so that's
not Mark's opinion
this is research people always ask me
what do you think about this what is
your opinion I'm like don't ask me my
opinion I'm
>> let me tell you what the research says
>> exactly I go back to the science I don't
want to be blamed for my opinion so to
to um play devil's advocate for the
parents. There is something to do with a
child's emotional fluidity and emotional
regulation that feels closer to their
sense of identity, who they are truly,
which is part of the lineage from parent
to child that the way that they join the
letter E to the letter S or the way that
they do their five times table does not
feel the same. It it it does feel more
sacred, more divine, more personal, more
attached to that sense of self and
identity. And if
it feels like you're [ __ ] with the
source code, frankly, it feels like
you're getting in there and [ __ ] with
the source code. So, I understand why
there would be more trepidation about
this. I didn't have this when I was in
school. This wasn't something that was
taught to me. what if it changes and
messes my kid up in some, you know, he's
gone in and he's changed the
bootloadader programming, you know, the
kid can't turn on and it just keeps
resetting and restarting or whatever.
Um, I think
>> if you were to teach the parents and
tell them these are the sorts of
outcomes as soon as you get an education
piece, I think a lot of that falls away.
Um, because the uncertainty is, hey,
this is,
>> you know, high high danger stuff that
we're playing with here. I'm happy to
undo little Timmy's five times table
being a little bit wrecked. the math
teacher was off. I don't like the idea
of trying to reframe his relationship
with shame because of you know what
happened in that way.
>> If they had I am uh reliably confident
that this thing is going to be good for
my kid, I think that they would there
would still be some push back because
like stop [ __ ] with the inner
workings of my child. Um but I think
that that would be alleviated. That I
think is my like uh um gracious uh
interpretation of why parents feel the
work that they do.
>> And you know, it's not all parents, it's
some parents, but yes. And you know, a
lot of parents are like, "Thank God
you're doing this cuz I don't know what
the heck I'm doing."
>> Um and by the way, it you know, it makes
it sound like kids don't have feelings
in school like they're anxious in math
class or they get left out at, you know,
at gym or nobody wants to sit with them
at the lunch table and we're just going
to ignore that. Like that's ridiculous.
Right? The kid is experiencing life 6 to
7 8 hours a day. Let's make sure that
kid is aware of what they're feeling,
has the courage to speak up, and has the
strategies to manage the frustration,
the overwhelm, the scare.
>> I mean, that just that there I can't
imagine like that really makes a lot of
sense to me. Um, and I hear you on that.
You know, one thing I'll just I'll push
back on your push back as as a little a
little role play here is that, you know,
given that anxiety in our society has
gone up like 50% in the last 30 years,
um like just parents, like you're not
doing such a good job.
>> So, yeah. Yeah. Show me the alternative.
I you know, I didn't deal with my
emotions and my son's not going to deal
with his either. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Um I'm I'm interested I'm interested
what are the most challenging emotions
to work with?
>> Uh does it vary from person to person? I
imagine it must do. There will be some
that are more sort of deeply seated. Our
genetic predisposition, our dopamine
baseline, you know, predisposes us to
whatever a effect.
>> Um but generally are there certain
emotions that are more difficult to work
with and easier to work with? I think in
general the what we call the
self-conscious emotions are the hardest
to deal with because when they are about
you as a human being like the shame kind
of family that's that's tough it's not
like dealing with you know I'm a little
I felt afraid of you know going to the
park as a kid you know it's that I have
diminished selfworth like someone has
made me believe that I'm not worthy it's
a lot more work to pair
the jealousy emotions the feeling that
you know people confuse by the what's
the difference between jealousy and envy
oh I I think I should know this um
jealousy is wanting someone to not have
it and envy is sort of about wishing
that that you were where someone else
is. Is that right?
>> You get a B+.
>> Close enough.
>> So envy is just wanting what the person
has, right? I said, "Yeah, that's that
like gosh, I wish I could have that."
>> Oh, it's jealousyy's fearing that
somebody else getting it is going to
take it away from you.
>> Hey, look, I'm not bullshitting. I've
spent a lot of time trying to think
about emotions, okay? Like, I I'm really
happy with my grades so far on this
>> [ __ ] pop pop pop quiz that it wasn't.
>> This is Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
This is not a pop psychology quiz. This
is a real, you know,
>> no pop as in I wasn't prepared for it.
you [ __ ] like sprung it upon me. Um,
there you go.
>> Okay. So, the the self-consciousness
emotions. Why?
>> And so, like jealousy is a big one
because like there's not a lot of
control. You know, when you're jealous
of, you know, that mom is giving your
sister, your brother more attention than
you and you feel like their their
relationship is stronger than yours.
>> That's a lot to work with, right?
There's there's a lot of layers to that
kind of um management and you you really
can't do it alone. The same thing with
the shame. It's very hard to manage
shame on your own. Often times we need
other people to help us kind of regain
our perspective.
Yeah, that's interesting. Okay. I I'm
interested if there is a distinction
between feeling emotions
and dealing with them and what the line
looks like between those two things. I
imagine it must be difficult to uh
regulate or deal with emotions without
feeling them. Uh but you presumably can
feel them without dealing with them. And
I don't know how much feeling you need
to do in order to be able to do like how
do you start to delineate the territory
though?
>> Well, this is an interesting
conversation around like the language of
emotion. So there's feelings, there's
emotions, there's moods, there's
dispositions, there's mental illnesses,
and they're all different. So should we
go there for a minute?
>> Sure.
>> Okay. So, an emotion is typically an
automatic response to a stimulus
that comes from something in our heads
or something in our environments
that causes us to that causes us to have
a shift in our thinking, in our
motivation, in our expression, in our
behavior that's rooted in our entire
life. That's the piece that I think
people miss. that when we're
experiencing an emotion, it's not just
from that moment. It's coming from our
entire life
to that moment. That's an emotion. A
feeling is it just a private subjective
experience. You know, I don't feel like
talking to Chris today. I don't feel
like going to the movies. You know, that
I don't get a good feeling when I think
about that person. That could be in your
body. It could be your head. It's a
little um more kind of this kind of
subjective experience. A mood can be
based off of an emotion or a feeling,
but it's different because it's longer
in duration and less intense.
So, like I'm irritable. I don't know
what it is, but I'm in a great mood
today. That's a mood. You don't really
know where it came from. It could be the
weather. It could be lingering good news
from yesterday.
A disposition is something we were kind
of getting at earlier, which is I tend
to be on the anxiety spectrum. You know,
I tend to be more sad in general. I tend
to be that kind of like everything's
going to be great. Um, that's more your
disposition. And then obviously, you
know, depression diagnosis, you know,
those are diagnoses. And so I think
people don't really know that
granularity, if you want to call it
that, in the language of emotion. And
that could be helpful for people to kind
of just just know.
>> I I certainly think that there is a a
difference a difficulty with people
confusing the two feeling an emotion and
dealing with it. It's like I'm feeling
my anxiety. It's like okay.
>> Yeah. I didn't get to answer your
question yet.
>> Yeah.
>> So that was just my I mean kind of like
being Mr. Professor for a minute to give
people like this kind of nuance in
language for feelings, moods, etc. You
were asking earlier about the difference
between kind of feeling your feelings
and dealing with your feelings. And my
point is that we don't have to deal with
all of our feelings. Sometimes they just
they're ephemeral. Oh, hi anxiety.
You're here for a minute. Welcome. See
you soon. No big deal. Um we get a
little frustrated in a meeting. We're
like it's going to go away. Like how
much is this going to really impact me
right now? Let it go. It's when we feel
like the emotion that we're experiencing
is going to interfere with our
relationship, with our learning, with
our um decisions, you know, with our u
performance. That's when you really need
to regulate.
Yeah, that's interesting. Um
I I want to talk about shame. I think
that shame is really interesting.
I I What do you How do you come to think
about shame? Is it a meta emotion? Is it
is it in a unique category in some way
given that shame is often one of those
second order things that I feel a thing
and I have shame around it. Um
I would say that you know as I I think
shame we were put in that in the
category of a self-conscious emotion.
But I think the the the the the
difficulty with shame is that we don't
put shame upon ourselves. For the most
part,
we are shamed by people. Someone else
has decided that we're not worthy and
they do everything they can to convince
us of that and then we believe it. And
that goes back to the gaslighting piece.
I think most of the shame that we
experience in life is because of other
people gaslighting us.
Say a little bit more about the
gaslighting thing. You don't really feel
that. You shouldn't feel that.
>> Yeah. Gaslighting is when essentially at
the heart of gaslighting is that the
reality that someone else has created
for you is something that you now
believe.
>> Could you give us an example in the
world of emotions?
>> Yeah. Uh let's say you know you know
Chris, you're just so sensitive.
you know, have you do have you realized
like you're you're just too sensitive?
And then in the beginning, you're like,
you know, well, maybe I am. I'm not. I
don't think I am. But after a while,
I've convinced you that you start
believing that you are too sensitive.
That's gaslighting.
What if it's true?
>> No one can be too sensitive.
>> Sorry about that. Now that I am very
interested in in hearing more about I
had a highly sensitive people uh and
what that means and whether you've
looked into that uh yeah as something
that I thought I wanted to talk about.
So give me give me more on that.
>> Yeah. I mean it's like having too much
self-compassion like there's no such
thing. Um the all of this is about
emotional intelligence at least what I'm
talking about here. So yes, you may be
prone to being sensitive. I'm a very
sensitive person, but my emotion
regulation is Mark, without it being
someone else's decision. Do you think
you're being too sensitive about this?
Do you think that, you know, oh, okay,
maybe this is an instance where I am
being a little too overreactive? Okay, I
can give myself that. But it can't be
someone else's definition for you.
That's just not cool.
I think when people when people think
about being too sensitive, what they
mean is your level of emotional
reactivity
is
nonfunctional in the real world and puts
you on the back foot.
>> Is that a fair assessment, do you think,
of kind of like h how some people think
about it?
>> It is. I don't think it's the right way
to think about it. I think what you're
getting at is that that person can't
regulate.
>> They don't have the strategies. They
have allowed someone to have
>> Oh, that makes Yeah. No, I I know
exactly what you mean. So, um
you are too sensitive is you seem to
feel things and not be able to deal with
them, not seem to be feeling things.
>> Correct.
>> Right. But
>> if you are somebody that is of the
highly sensitive persuasion, it's almost
like um it's almost like coming from a
family of fat people or something like
you have great agrein release, you have
a bigger stomach, you have a lower BMR
or whatever. uh you my friend
unfortunately are going to have to do
more work to stay in shape than person
from skinny family with smaller stomach
less grein higher uh BMR uh do you see
it kind of in that sort of a way that
people who are more prone to sensitivity
i.e feel things more deeply both up and
down depth. Um that there is if
>> no I I think sensitivity is just one
example. I mean I have a friend who is a
former tennis coach who has so much
energy she makes me want to like crawl
under a blanket you know and it's like
calms down
your energy is killing me. So, she needs
to know how to downregulate
because of her kind of endless need to
be enthusiastic and excited about
things. I'm like, gosh, like, can you
calm down? I, on the other hand, am
someone who, you know, I would rather go
for a cup of coffee and sit at a wine
bar. And sometimes she's like, you know,
Mark, come on. Like, can we get a little
energy here? Like, can you like, you
know, can I'm like,
>> that's not me. However, as someone who
presents a lot at conferences, I can't
be like talking like I'm in a coffee
shop for an hour and a half on a
presentation, right? I've got to get
myself out of my comfort zone and like
be the entertainer and tell the jokes
and like
>> and that's draining for me, whereas it's
not draining for her. She could do it
all day long, but but she's draining for
me. Do you feel like we all It's like
it's it's about self-awareness and
social awareness. And so I it's not that
anything is bad. I just think that's a
bad way to think about it. Like we are
who we are. People are people. You know,
unless you're being mean and cruel,
then you know, be who you are.
>> Unless you're selfharming, be who you
are. You have to learn that you have to
navigate who you are in relationships
and in leadership positions, sports
teams, you know, whatever it is. And
that's where the regulation piece comes
in. That's where it's like, oh, I'm
aware that I'm talking too much. Mark,
shut up. You calm down.
Yeah, I think you get what I'm saying.
>> Yeah, I know. I do. I do completely. Um,
we are who we are and
sometimes the right amount of that is
great and sometimes too much of it
requires a little bit of uh regression
or progression to some other kind of
like optimal mean. How we want to show
up as best for ourselves, how it's good
to show up for other people in the
world, non-judgmental, empathetic, good
listener, etc. Um,
>> yeah.
>> And to also achieve the things that we
want to. If you're a performer on stage,
you want to show up differently to if
you're a a poet that works in the woods
or a, you know, exactly a woodworker
that's just down the street. I think the
reason that I lingered on the the highly
sensitive people bit is that it seems to
me kind of highly sensitive people are
the hyperresponders to the work that
you're interested in. If they are very
sensitive, then they're going to feel
emotions, which is the currency that
you're trafficing in more than other
people. If you imagine whatever high
highly sensitive person is on one end of
the spectrum and a
>> highly insensitive person or whatever
that that that is on the other end of
the spectrum, I have to assume that the
tactics and techniques that you're
talking about, the sitting with
emotions, the working with them,
integrating them, fluidity, regulation,
the insensitive person simply is feeling
less. The resolution with which they are
feeling emotions is not as great as the
person on the other end. If that's%
>> and and and with that it means that
>> you are as a highly sensitive person not
burdened but kind of obliged in a way if
you want to show up fully there is a
there are skills that you need to use
and and maybe more so than your
insensitive friend.
>> So to put it in like the language of
personality psychology um I am one of
those people. I have a high startle
reflex, you know. I'm like I have a
fifth degree black belt and I'm walking
down the streets and like there's a big
noise. I'm like, you know, and
everybody's like, I thought you were the
fifth degree black belt. Yeah.
>> Like I am the fifth degree blood, but
I'm just afraid of my shadow.
>> I can protect myself, but like my I have
an a very high start reflex.
>> I'll I'll [ __ ] you up, but first I'm
going to jump.
>> Exactly.
>> Yeah.
>> I I'll I'll gather myself quickly. Don't
worry. Um, but another piece of it is
that I'm also high in a personality
trait called neuroticism.
And so I am sensitive to my environment.
I am someone who is like a I'm moody,
then I'm fine, then I'm a little moody,
then I'm irritable, then I'm not
irritable. I just I've been that way.
I'm 56. It's proven this is my
personality.
>> For a hundred years, well, I'm 56. For
35 of my life, years of my life before I
became an expert in this, I assumed that
was my destiny.
I assumed that my personality and my
temperament was just that's who I am.
I'm a person who experiences these
emotions and there's nothing you could
do about it. And then I did research on
this and I found that there's zero
correlation between that personality
trait and emotional intelligence.
Why is that? Because guess what? Someone
like me, I have a lot of opportunities
to practice my skills.
You know, because I get a little worried
before I meet. I'm like, "Mark, take
your breath. I think this way. Mark, you
got this. You've had 500 of these
meetings. You know, I'm using those
strategies and I enter that meeting not
like this, but just like that. Someone
who is more on the resilient side or
someone who is less volatile or uh
steady, you might say, um or emotionally
stable is the word we use in psychology.
>> They're kind of more even keeled. The
problem with those people is that [ __ ]
happens
and they may not have as much
preparation as a person who's like me,
the sensitive person. So again, it's not
a strength or a weakness. It's just that
you have to know who you are and be
aware that the person who's more even
healed all of a sudden there's a death
in the family and they just they've
never really had a lot of emotions to
deal with and all of a sudden it's like,
"Oh my gosh, I don't even know where to
go with this. I can't deal with my grief
or my sadness. Does this does this make
sense?
>> Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Completely. I would say look, one
of the big things that I learned and
it's cool. It's really serendipitous
that I was talking to talking to you
this week after the last week that I
spent, you know, this is a full week
retreat, uh, and I ended up on a farm in
Sonoma County for nine days and it's
been incredibly formative to me. And to
be honest, I'm still
trying to work out what the [ __ ] it all
means. Um,
>> and it's a different sort of language.
It's me getting below the neck, not not
sort of above the neck. Um, but I
realized and I've known for a while, but
was I think embarrassed to sort of admit
it, that I'm also I would put myself in
the whatever it is one in five highly
sensitive people
>> category. Um, and I didn't like that. I
didn't like the idea of thinking about
my sensitivity because I didn't see it
as a strength. I saw it. It it
>> I grew up in the most blueco collar
working-class town in the northeast of
the UK.
>> Uh it's state primary, state, secondary,
state, six form college. Played a a a
sport where you're around men,
working-class men from the age of
>> 12, 13 until I was 20. There wasn't much
room
>> for that to come through. I didn't have
many role models of people who were
integrating or regulating or being fluid
with their emotions in a good way. And I
think
>> it it hadn't been rewarded by the
environment and it's it's difficult to
deal with. So suppression for me was
much easier. And last week uh having
spent I spent a lot of time like just
you know staring into the abyss of my
own emotions and the abyss staring back
at me and sometimes punching me in the
nuts. Um,
I I I was really proud. It was the first
time, I think, in my in my life that I
really saw the depth of of my
sensitivity and and realized how proud I
was of it.
>> Holy [ __ ] Like, look at how look at how
it's enabled you to show up for people.
How
>> not how dare you cuz that that's very
judgmental, but like what a
how unfortunate that you haven't
realized what a blessing it is and how
what a shame. And I grieved I grieved
over the fact that I'd been mean to
myself about my sensitivity. It's like
[ __ ] like you were so nasty to yourself
about feeling stuff. Like who says that
you shouldn't feel stuff? Who says that
you shouldn't do that? And um yeah I you
know for the I I get the sense that this
is the sort of podcast that attracts
people who feel things pretty deeply.
Like you why are you listening to 90
minutes on emotions if you are not
someone that's like what anxiety? I
don't know what you're talking about.
Um, so yeah, I just it was a really
enlightening experience for me to see,
[ __ ] like that's a strength. It's a
real strength that I have. Um, and I
shouldn't be ashamed of it. So yeah, I
uh I'm I'm very pro- highly sensitive
people at the moment.
>> Well, I think what you're really pro,
not to put words in your mouth, is going
back to permission to feel. like you're
pro allowing yourself to feel and maybe
that will help you show up for other
people in your life as non-judgmental
as a good listener you know and as
empathic empathic and compassionate
>> I didn't share with you the outcome of
this though so what I find in my
research is that people who had that
uncle Marvin you know that permission to
feel in adulthood they sleep better
mental health better physical ical
health, greater life satisfaction and
greater purpose and meaning in life.
>> So for those of you who are thinking,
oh, you know, does this really matter?
Is this just like these like soft
attributes? No, actually you providing
the opportunity for people to grow up in
an environment where they can feel and
talk about their feelings and learn
strategies to deal with them is
producing people who are healthier,
happier, and more effective. M
is
is it possible to be too self-aware?
No.
Sorry. Again, it all goes back to
regulation. It all goes back, you know,
one thing that we didn't talk about yet
is this idea of being an emotion
scientist about your life. And, you
know, again, most of us are emotion
judges. You know, we're not that
self-aware. You know, we're like, I'm
feeling fine. and I'm, you know, I'm
ignoring my feelings. I'm thinking that
this is who I am and I can't change. But
the emotion scientist is always kind of
checking in like, did how I regulate
that work? Did it not work? What might I
do differently next time? The emotion
scientist says, did I really know how I
felt in that moment? Um, or maybe I need
to really think like get on that app and
like plot the real feeling that I'm
having. So that endless curiosity is
actually helpful,
but it's not. And this is a really I'm
glad you brought this up because another
one of the push backs, remember the
whole parenting thing we're talking
about?
>> Well, another push back that I get is
Mark is trying to make a world filled
with self-indulgent people.
>> Mhm.
>> And I'm like, there's a big difference
between selfawareness and
selfindulgence.
I do not want you or me or anybody
checking in with their feelings 500
times a day. that is unhelpful. That
will cause you to ruminate. That will
cause you to go nuts. What I want us to
do is I want us to look at our lives and
think,
how am I feeling in general? That's a
good question to ask yourself. But
throughout the day, there are strategic
moments like when you walk into your
office or before a podcast or before you
go home or before you're making an
important decision. Just check in. How
am I feeling? Is this feeling helpful?
Is it unhelpful? What emotion would be
most helpful to achieve my goal? That's
the goal of emotional intelligence.
>> That's great. It's I wonder whether
emotional regulation is sometimes a mask
for people pleasing.
I have to think about that one for a
second. Is emotion regulation? Well, I
think
if it's in authentic regulation, right?
If it's, you know, yes. But real emotion
regulation, you know, the subtitle of my
book is it's dealing with feeling. Use
your emotions to create the life you
want. And I think that's the the key
element here is that
we deserve to have the best lives ever.
We can have all the money in the world.
We can have all the objects in the world
and all the fame in the world. But if we
don't like ourselves, like if I don't
wake up and say, you know, Mark, you're
a good guy. And if I'm not trying to
make the world a better place, whether
it's in my career or in my office,
um, and using strategies wisely to do
that, to me, you know, at least for me,
my life isn't worth living.
>> I think emotional regulation as a mask
for people pleasing is
confusing.
Emotional regulation for compromising
boundaries.
It's, oh, this thing has happened. I'm
going to allow the emotion to move
through me and then it not be a signal
for my action on the other side of it
that you almost uh neutralize the the
the emotional signal. So you could
imagine somebody who does do emotional
regulation is people pleasing thing
happens I'm agitated I'm frustrated I'm
angry I'm upset I'm whatever and you
don't use that to say hey when you did
that thing it made me feel X or this is
something that occurred and it's not
going I don't want it to happen again.
If you start shouting, I'm going to
leave the house and I'm going to come
back in 15 minutes. And if you're still
shouting, I'm going to leave the house
and I'm going to come back in 15
minutes.
>> Like emotional regulation, I think, is
the concern around that and how it leads
into people pleasing is to do the first
bit, but like to do the sensing bit, but
not to do the deploying bit.
>> Well, you you're giving the example of
poor regulation, which is out of fear, a
partner in a relationship might say,
"No, it's okay, honey. It's okay." you
know, I didn't mean it, but you did mean
it, you know, and so that's an excuse
for not actually dealing with your
feeling. It's actually not dealing with
the feeling because the the real
strategy for dealing with the relational
issue is to have the difficult
conversation. But because you're afraid
of the outcome of that, you decide to
people please or suppress or deny.
[Music]
>> Okay. If someone who's listening Great.
But this is like my new test of
emotional intelligent. I like this. Keep
going.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, this this this uh
this next one should be a [ __ ]
straight down the the center of the
plate for you. Someone that's listening
realizes emotional habits are bad.
They're reactive or defensive or
avoidant or whatever. What is the first
step to reshaping them in your opinion?
>> I think the first step is a you've
acknowledged it. like just acknowledge
the fact that my, you know, my the way
I'm dealing with my feelings is not
working for me to have the life I want.
Awareness is the first step.
I would ask, you know, I would ask
people to maybe, you know, they can
read, they can download an app, just
build knowledge. You have to have
knowledge. You can't, this is not like
you're not born with these skills and
strategies. You've got to learn the
strategies. You know, I didn't know
there was something called positive
self-t talk.
I just looked in the mirror and was had
self-hatred for so many years of my
life.
>> And then all of a sudden said to me,
Mark, you know, you could think about
this from a different lens. You can
reappraise, you can reframe.
I was like, wow, what the heck is that?
I never heard of that one before. Um,
and so I think people just have to learn
the skills and then you got to practice
them over and over and over again
because this is, you know, a lot of us
have to unlearn. like you're telling me.
By the way, my research in in in uh the
UK was there were no there was no
cultural differences in the attributes,
but only 18% of people said they grew up
with someone who gave them permission to
feel.
So other places about a third, UK was
18%. So we got to do some we got to push
some love over to the UK. Um
>> that does not surprise me.
Um,
but I think awareness is the first step.
Build your vocabulary is the next step.
Be just be more like really be curious
about how you're feeling. And then ask
yourself, you know, is how I'm feeling
is how I'm dealing with my feelings
working for me or against me. And I use
I use different criteria. I use things
like just generally am I happy? Am I
what's my well-being? Am I making the
choices that are best for me? How are my
relationships? How are my goals? You
know, am I achieving what I want in my
professional life? And if the answer is
no to any of those, then start looking
for those patterns as you said and then
learn the strategies and practice them
for the rest of your life because uh I
thought like I said when the pandemic
hit like Mark you're the director of the
center for emotional intelligence you've
got this and it was like whoa
>> I don't
>> and now you know five years later I got
it a little bit more because I wrote a
whole book on it. So I the way I like
for me what the way I do it is like I
have to translate everything that I
think I know into writing because then I
actually know what I'm talking about.
>> Um and now I feel like wow I got more I
got I got I really know this stuff now.
Am I good at it all? Absolutely not.
>> It's going to take
no way.
>> Dr. Mark Brackett, ladies and gentlemen.
Mark, you're great. I really appreciate
you. I think your work's wonderful.
Where should people go? They want to
check out all of your stuff. Yeah, I
think they should go to my personal
website which is just mark bracket m a r
c b r a c ket.com. I'm on Instagram,
LinkedIn and my book is called Dealing
with Dealing.
>> Heck yeah, Mark. I appreciate you. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Congratulations. You made it
to the end of an episode. Your brain has
not been completely destroyed by the
internet just yet. Here's another one
that you should watch.
Go on.
