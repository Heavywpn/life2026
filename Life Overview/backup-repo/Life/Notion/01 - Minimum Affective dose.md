## Minimum Effective Dose (MED) from The 4-Hour Body

The concept of Minimum Effective Dose (MED) is a key principle in Tim Ferriss' book "The 4-Hour Body". It refers to the smallest dose that will produce a desired outcome. Here's a summary:

- MED is about achieving maximum results with minimum effort or intervention.
- It applies to exercise, diet, and supplementation, arguing that doing the minimum necessary is often more effective than overdoing it.
- For exercise, MED means focusing on the least amount of exercise needed to achieve desired results, rather than spending hours at the gym.
- In diet, it involves identifying the smallest changes that yield the biggest impact on health and body composition.
- For supplementation, MED encourages using the lowest effective dose of any supplement to achieve the desired effect.

Ferriss emphasizes that exceeding the MED is not only wasteful but can often be counterproductive, leading to diminishing returns or even negative outcomes.
