isn't like  other watches this is a Wi-Fi detho watch allows  **0:06**me to attack Wi-Fi networks as always with these  kinds of devices only attack networks that you  **0:11**have permission to attack or that you own in this  example I've got a phone and a laptop connected to  **0:17**a Wi-Fi network I can access the internet on this  phone I'll also start a continuous ping on this  **0:23**laptop and hopefully you can see that this laptop  is able to Ping google.com but what happens when  **0:30**I start the deor tack so I'll press Start packets  are now being sent into the network de oring  **0:36**clients and what you should see is the laptop can  no longer ping google.com I have deor this laptop  **0:45**from the Wi-Fi network on the phone try and go  to YouTube It's failing because the device has  **0:52**been kicked off the Wi-Fi network if I go and  look at my Wi-Fi settings and try and connect  **0:57**to my Wi-Fi network it says connection pH try  and do that again connection failed devices are  **1:03**no longer able to access the internet because  deor packets are being sent from the watch to  **1:10**the Wi-Fi access point this little access point  right over here kicking clients off the network  **1:15**okay I'll stop the deor attack and what you  should notice hopefully is that pings start  **1:20**succeeding on the laptop and there you go and if  I connect back to the Wi-Fi network I'm able to  **1:25**do that I'm connected now and I should be able  to go to youtube.com which I can under ssids you  **1:34**can specify the clone of access points so you  can see I'm cloning a whole bunch here or you  **1:39**could go with a random mode to create a bunch  of random access points so I'll go back back  **1:44**again deny access beacons and start and what  I'll do here is look at the different Wi-Fi  **1:51**networks and you can see a bunch of fake Wi-Fi  networks exist you could use Rick Roll Nam share**2:02**one caveat with this watch is it only supports  2.4 GHz and not 5 GHz but it's a fantastic little  **2:07**device for testing and demonstration purposes now  this is called the Wi-Fi Commander not a Wi-Fi de  WIFI Commander features and unboxing**2:13**arthor even though it supports de oror tax and  other types of attacks this is very similar once  **2:18**again to this watch that I've demonstrated and  that's very similar to the Wi-Fi nugget as well  **2:24**as the meltronics de author now we're told that  it's got a 1.5 in OLED display it's got a digital  **2:30**Crown control now this was made in England  which is interesting not that much stuff is  **2:34**made in England these days it's a trademark of  code junkies once again I purchased this they  **2:40**are not sponsoring this video they don't know  that I'm even making this video that's enough  **2:44**talking let's unbox this not great packaging if  you like very basic so I got this from Amazon so  **2:50**what we get is the watch and a cable that's it so  that's the unboxing experience nothing fancy but  **2:57**it definitely looks more like a watch than this  does it's got a rub a strap here the strap isn't  **3:02**as nice I mean that doesn't look like a watch  this does so what's interesting is this didn't  **3:06**come with any instructions no instructions at  all but again that looks much more like a watch  **3:11**than what this thing does but the proof of the  pudding is can it actually do what they say it  **3:16**can now there are some issues with this device I  found that the battery doesn't last that long I  **3:20**probably need to charge it for longer before I  continue with the demonstrations also the one  **3:24**that I got the charger is covered here so the  only way to charge this is to pop it up out of  **3:29**the watch and I saw on Amazon the reviews are  quite bad because people have found that it's  **3:33**broken when they've popped it out or popped it  back in but that hasn't been my experience so  **3:38**what you got to do is you got to use a micro USB  cable one is supplied with the watch and now it  **3:43**works as you can see it's powered up properly now  so you could just use it like this but obviously  **3:48**it makes more sense to use this as a watch but  you could just hold it like this in your palm  **3:53**of your hand as an example the power of the Sun  in the palm of my hand an attack Networks in the  **3:59**same way I mean that's a very small device that  could be hidden in your hand this is basically a  **4:04**better version of the previous watch that I've  demonstrated lot lot smaller looks more like  **4:09**a watch than this thing does remember the caveat  with this is it only supports 2.4 GHz that is made  **4:14**clear on the box only 2.4 GHz is supported okay  once you turn the watch on we can see that this  WIFI Commander demo // Scanning access points and Deauthing**4:20**is authorized by space Hardware by code junkies  when it boots up you're probably going to want  **4:25**to scan for Wi-Fi networks and you can scan for  either access points or stations themselves I'm  **4:30**going to scan for both now I have found that this  doesn't always work the display shows that there  **4:35**are zero access points even though it's actually  picking up access points as you can see here it's  **4:40**picked up one station but again that information  is incorrect and I've found that it freezes here  **4:45**so I'm going to Simply press the button again I'm  going to go back and then I'm going to select an  **4:50**access point so select and then access points I'm  going to select the access point that we're going  **4:55**to attack which is the TP Link 2.4 GHz that's  this little TP Link link right over here again  **5:01**only ever attack networks that you own or have  permission to attack so I'm going to select that  **5:07**and I'm going to go back and back again and now  we can deny access so select that option and let's  **5:13**say as an example specify deor and then start de  oring and what you'll notice over here is pings  **5:19**are now timing out so this device can no longer  access the internet so on the phone I'll press go  **5:27**notice no internet is available so we have success  sucessfully deauth to the network you can see that  **5:32**we're sending packets but if I stop that we should  see is on the Windows computer PS should start  **5:38**working again which they do so deor attac has now  been stopped so it's as simple as that once again  **5:44**to launch a deor attac using this watch really  cool that it's so much smaller than the previous  **5:49**generations that I've demonstrated just looks like  a standard sports watch as an example now another  Sending Beacons**5:53**option here is to send beacons I'll select beacons  and then I'll scroll down and start the attack so  **6:02**beacons are being sent out into the network now  now this can be used to fake the real Network or  **6:07**just Spam the air with a bunch of fake networks  so as an example if I go to Wi-Fi and look at the  **6:13**Wi-Fi networks notice I'm suddenly seeing a whole  bunch of TPL link networks many of them these are  **6:21**all fake networks so I'll stop that attack  and go back the reason I was able to do that  **6:27**is under ssids you you can specify the clone of  access points so you can see I'm cloning a whole  **6:33**bunch here or you could go with a random mode to  create a bunch of random access points so I'll go  **6:39**back back again deny access beacons and start and  what I'll do here is look at the different Wi-Fi  **6:47**networks and you can see a bunch of fake Wi-Fi  networks exist you could use Rick Roll name share  **6:57**but as you can see a whole bunch of random ssids  are now being broadcast by the watch now various  Packet monitor**7:05**other options are also supported so I can go back  and then I could do a packet monitor as an example  **7:13**and monitor packets in the network so I can see  what's going on now one of the options with the  WIFI Commander remote connection and control**7:18**watch is you can actually connect to it remotely  so I'm going to select the Ping SSID we told that  **7:25**this is an open network I'm okay with that so  I'm going to connect to to the open network  **7:31**called Pang so I'm now connected to that Network  and in my browser so I'm going to browse to 1921  **7:36**16841 and as you can see a web page is opened we  told that this project is a proof of concept for  **7:42**testing and educational purposes only the watch  uses an esp8266 so we warned that the esp8266 chip  **7:50**and the SDK are not built for real world purposes  they only Built for testing and education purposes  **7:57**and bugs can occur and we told the only use this  against our own networks and devices which I'm  **8:02**doing so you can get more information on GitHub  once again space hun or space chicken if you use  **8:09**the English translation has more information on  his website and I said I've read the notice and  **8:15**what I'll do here is Click reload and that shows  me the various Wi-Fi networks so I can see the  **8:22**encryption used I can see the MAC address I  can see the power whole bunch of information  **8:29**about Wi-Fi networks I can also see client  devices so if I go to ssids I could clone  **8:36**an SSID or add one and I could enable  random mode so at the moment clicking  **8:41**reload a bunch of them are random so a whole  bunch of random ssids I'll remove those and  **8:47**click reload now again you could add your own  ssids here and um do a Rick Roll SSID as an**8:53**example so under deny we could start a deauth  attack we could start a beacon attack we could  **9:02**start probing they also give us a nice  explanation of what each does so Beacon  **9:06**packets are used to advertise access points  deal I've demonstrated where we knock clients  **9:11**off a network and probes are sent by client  devices to ask if a known network is nearby  **9:16**you can use this attack to confuse Wi-Fi trackers  by asking for networks that you specified in the  **9:22**SSID list I could go to settings and reboot the  device as an example or reset it now I've put  Spacehuhntech GitHub, Amazon and product page**9:29**links below to space Hun's GitHub page where you  can get a lot of information about the ESP 82660  **9:35**author that he created fantastic project he gives  you information about how it works I've also put  **9:40**a link to Amazon where I bought this can see the  ratings here are terrible but there is an overview  **9:46**of the device on Amazon and you can have a look  at their website to get more information again I  **9:51**think it's a great little tools for demonstration  purposes it only supports 2.4 GHz however doesn't  **9:57**always work with modern access points even  when they use 2.4 GHz so if you want to stop  How to prevent WIFI pranks**10:02**kids using devices like this from pranking you or  destroying your Wi-Fi network or you want to stop  **10:08**hackers that have more powerful devices that  can do something similar use wp3 with a strong  **10:14**password not just numbers but mixed characters  uppercase lowercase special characters etc make  **10:20**the password long use WPA version 3 use 5 GHz  use 6 GHz hope you enjoyed this video if you  Conclusion**10:27**did please consider liking it please consider  subscribing

isn't like  other watches this is a Wi-Fi detho watch allows  **0:06**me to attack Wi-Fi networks as always with these  kinds of devices only attack networks that you  **0:11**have permission to attack or that you own in this  example I've got a phone and a laptop connected to  **0:17**a Wi-Fi network I can access the internet on this  phone I'll also start a continuous ping on this  **0:23**laptop and hopefully you can see that this laptop  is able to Ping google.com but what happens when  **0:30**I start the deor tack so I'll press Start packets  are now being sent into the network de oring  **0:36**clients and what you should see is the laptop can  no longer ping google.com I have deor this laptop  **0:45**from the Wi-Fi network on the phone try and go  to YouTube It's failing because the device has  **0:52**been kicked off the Wi-Fi network if I go and  look at my Wi-Fi settings and try and connect  **0:57**to my Wi-Fi network it says connection pH try  and do that again connection failed devices are  **1:03**no longer able to access the internet because  deor packets are being sent from the watch to  **1:10**the Wi-Fi access point this little access point  right over here kicking clients off the network  **1:15**okay I'll stop the deor attack and what you  should notice hopefully is that pings start  **1:20**succeeding on the laptop and there you go and if  I connect back to the Wi-Fi network I'm able to  **1:25**do that I'm connected now and I should be able  to go to youtube.com which I can under ssids you  **1:34**can specify the clone of access points so you  can see I'm cloning a whole bunch here or you  **1:39**could go with a random mode to create a bunch  of random access points so I'll go back back  **1:44**again deny access beacons and start and what  I'll do here is look at the different Wi-Fi  **1:51**networks and you can see a bunch of fake Wi-Fi  networks exist you could use Rick Roll Nam share**2:02**one caveat with this watch is it only supports  2.4 GHz and not 5 GHz but it's a fantastic little  **2:07**device for testing and demonstration purposes now  this is called the Wi-Fi Commander not a Wi-Fi de  WIFI Commander features and unboxing**2:13**arthor even though it supports de oror tax and  other types of attacks this is very similar once  **2:18**again to this watch that I've demonstrated and  that's very similar to the Wi-Fi nugget as well  **2:24**as the meltronics de author now we're told that  it's got a 1.5 in OLED display it's got a digital  **2:30**Crown control now this was made in England  which is interesting not that much stuff is  **2:34**made in England these days it's a trademark of  code junkies once again I purchased this they  **2:40**are not sponsoring this video they don't know  that I'm even making this video that's enough  **2:44**talking let's unbox this not great packaging if  you like very basic so I got this from Amazon so  **2:50**what we get is the watch and a cable that's it so  that's the unboxing experience nothing fancy but  **2:57**it definitely looks more like a watch than this  does it's got a rub a strap here the strap isn't  **3:02**as nice I mean that doesn't look like a watch  this does so what's interesting is this didn't  **3:06**come with any instructions no instructions at  all but again that looks much more like a watch  **3:11**than what this thing does but the proof of the  pudding is can it actually do what they say it  **3:16**can now there are some issues with this device I  found that the battery doesn't last that long I  **3:20**probably need to charge it for longer before I  continue with the demonstrations also the one  **3:24**that I got the charger is covered here so the  only way to charge this is to pop it up out of  **3:29**the watch and I saw on Amazon the reviews are  quite bad because people have found that it's  **3:33**broken when they've popped it out or popped it  back in but that hasn't been my experience so  **3:38**what you got to do is you got to use a micro USB  cable one is supplied with the watch and now it  **3:43**works as you can see it's powered up properly now  so you could just use it like this but obviously  **3:48**it makes more sense to use this as a watch but  you could just hold it like this in your palm  **3:53**of your hand as an example the power of the Sun  in the palm of my hand an attack Networks in the  **3:59**same way I mean that's a very small device that  could be hidden in your hand this is basically a  **4:04**better version of the previous watch that I've  demonstrated lot lot smaller looks more like  **4:09**a watch than this thing does remember the caveat  with this is it only supports 2.4 GHz that is made  **4:14**clear on the box only 2.4 GHz is supported okay  once you turn the watch on we can see that this  WIFI Commander demo // Scanning access points and Deauthing**4:20**is authorized by space Hardware by code junkies  when it boots up you're probably going to want  **4:25**to scan for Wi-Fi networks and you can scan for  either access points or stations themselves I'm  **4:30**going to scan for both now I have found that this  doesn't always work the display shows that there  **4:35**are zero access points even though it's actually  picking up access points as you can see here it's  **4:40**picked up one station but again that information  is incorrect and I've found that it freezes here  **4:45**so I'm going to Simply press the button again I'm  going to go back and then I'm going to select an  **4:50**access point so select and then access points I'm  going to select the access point that we're going  **4:55**to attack which is the TP Link 2.4 GHz that's  this little TP Link link right over here again  **5:01**only ever attack networks that you own or have  permission to attack so I'm going to select that  **5:07**and I'm going to go back and back again and now  we can deny access so select that option and let's  **5:13**say as an example specify deor and then start de  oring and what you'll notice over here is pings  **5:19**are now timing out so this device can no longer  access the internet so on the phone I'll press go  **5:27**notice no internet is available so we have success  sucessfully deauth to the network you can see that  **5:32**we're sending packets but if I stop that we should  see is on the Windows computer PS should start  **5:38**working again which they do so deor attac has now  been stopped so it's as simple as that once again  **5:44**to launch a deor attac using this watch really  cool that it's so much smaller than the previous  **5:49**generations that I've demonstrated just looks like  a standard sports watch as an example now another  Sending Beacons**5:53**option here is to send beacons I'll select beacons  and then I'll scroll down and start the attack so  **6:02**beacons are being sent out into the network now  now this can be used to fake the real Network or  **6:07**just Spam the air with a bunch of fake networks  so as an example if I go to Wi-Fi and look at the  **6:13**Wi-Fi networks notice I'm suddenly seeing a whole  bunch of TPL link networks many of them these are  **6:21**all fake networks so I'll stop that attack  and go back the reason I was able to do that  **6:27**is under ssids you you can specify the clone of  access points so you can see I'm cloning a whole  **6:33**bunch here or you could go with a random mode to  create a bunch of random access points so I'll go  **6:39**back back again deny access beacons and start and  what I'll do here is look at the different Wi-Fi  **6:47**networks and you can see a bunch of fake Wi-Fi  networks exist you could use Rick Roll name share  **6:57**but as you can see a whole bunch of random ssids  are now being broadcast by the watch now various  Packet monitor**7:05**other options are also supported so I can go back  and then I could do a packet monitor as an example  **7:13**and monitor packets in the network so I can see  what's going on now one of the options with the  WIFI Commander remote connection and control**7:18**watch is you can actually connect to it remotely  so I'm going to select the Ping SSID we told that  **7:25**this is an open network I'm okay with that so  I'm going to connect to to the open network  **7:31**called Pang so I'm now connected to that Network  and in my browser so I'm going to browse to 1921  **7:36**16841 and as you can see a web page is opened we  told that this project is a proof of concept for  **7:42**testing and educational purposes only the watch  uses an esp8266 so we warned that the esp8266 chip  **7:50**and the SDK are not built for real world purposes  they only Built for testing and education purposes  **7:57**and bugs can occur and we told the only use this  against our own networks and devices which I'm  **8:02**doing so you can get more information on GitHub  once again space hun or space chicken if you use  **8:09**the English translation has more information on  his website and I said I've read the notice and  **8:15**what I'll do here is Click reload and that shows  me the various Wi-Fi networks so I can see the  **8:22**encryption used I can see the MAC address I  can see the power whole bunch of information  **8:29**about Wi-Fi networks I can also see client  devices so if I go to ssids I could clone  **8:36**an SSID or add one and I could enable  random mode so at the moment clicking  **8:41**reload a bunch of them are random so a whole  bunch of random ssids I'll remove those and  **8:47**click reload now again you could add your own  ssids here and um do a Rick Roll SSID as an**8:53**example so under deny we could start a deauth  attack we could start a beacon attack we could  **9:02**start probing they also give us a nice  explanation of what each does so Beacon  **9:06**packets are used to advertise access points  deal I've demonstrated where we knock clients  **9:11**off a network and probes are sent by client  devices to ask if a known network is nearby  **9:16**you can use this attack to confuse Wi-Fi trackers  by asking for networks that you specified in the  **9:22**SSID list I could go to settings and reboot the  device as an example or reset it now I've put  Spacehuhntech GitHub, Amazon and product page**9:29**links below to space Hun's GitHub page where you  can get a lot of information about the ESP 82660  **9:35**author that he created fantastic project he gives  you information about how it works I've also put  **9:40**a link to Amazon where I bought this can see the  ratings here are terrible but there is an overview  **9:46**of the device on Amazon and you can have a look  at their website to get more information again I  **9:51**think it's a great little tools for demonstration  purposes it only supports 2.4 GHz however doesn't  **9:57**always work with modern access points even  when they use 2.4 GHz so if you want to stop  How to prevent WIFI pranks**10:02**kids using devices like this from pranking you or  destroying your Wi-Fi network or you want to stop  **10:08**hackers that have more powerful devices that  can do something similar use wp3 with a strong  **10:14**password not just numbers but mixed characters  uppercase lowercase special characters etc make  **10:20**the password long use WPA version 3 use 5 GHz  use 6 GHz hope you enjoyed this video if you  Conclusion**10:27**did please consider liking it please consider  subscribing
