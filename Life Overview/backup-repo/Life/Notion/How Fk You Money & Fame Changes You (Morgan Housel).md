# SUMMARY

Morgan Housel discusses how wealth and fame impact personality, using examples like J. Paul Getty, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump.

# IDEAS:

- Money amplifies existing personality traits rather than fundamentally changing them
- Extreme wealth doesn't guarantee happiness or contentment
- The ability to "afford to be different" often leads to personality changes in the wealthy
- Fame and fortune can significantly alter personalities, as seen with figures like Elon Musk and Donald Trump
- Depressed individuals may mistakenly believe money will solve their problems
- Wealth can sometimes remove hope by eliminating financial goals to strive for
- Power, alcohol, and drugs act as amplifiers of personality, similar to money
- People often underestimate how much wealth would change them
- How someone treats service workers can reveal their true character
- Having "f*\#k you money" may reveal aspects of personality previously hidden
- Warren Buffett's philanthropy shows a positive use of extreme wealth
- The impact of wealth on personality can be observed through changes over time in public figures
- People's behavior often changes when they no longer need to maintain social niceties
- The way wealth changes people can be both positive and negative
- Wealth can provide opportunities for significant philanthropic impact
- The desire for more money can sometimes mask underlying issues
- Fame can exaggerate both positive and negative personality traits
- Financial success doesn't necessarily correlate with personal fulfillment
- The perception of wealth's impact often differs from the reality
- The effects of sudden wealth can be particularly dramatic

# QUOTES:

- "if you are already happy gaining more money will probably make you happier but if you're already kind of depressed gaining more money is probably not going to help that much"
- "people who are happier than me"
- "money didn't help him because he was already depressed and in that situation it's it's not going to do much"
- "When Will Smith was poor and depressed he could say to himself if only I had more money everything would be better"
- "money actually subtracted The Hope from his life because he realized there's nothing else to strive for"
- "money just accentuates who you are if you're a jerk it's going to make you more of a jerk if you're happy it's probably going to make you happier"
- "nobody would be the same if they could afford to be different"
- "adversity doesn't build character it reveals it"
- "when you really have [ __ ] you money right how often do you actually say [ __ ] you"

# FACTS:

# RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Watch early interviews of public figures to observe how fame and wealth changed them over time
- Read biographies of wealthy individuals to understand the impact of money on their lives
- Be cautious about assuming money will solve all problems, especially mental health issues
- Consider how you might change if you suddenly became extremely wealthy
- Observe how wealthy individuals treat service workers as a measure of their character
- Be aware that gaining significant wealth might reveal hidden aspects of your personality
- Use wealth as an opportunity for philanthropy and positive impact, like Warren Buffett
- Reflect on what truly brings happiness and fulfillment beyond financial success
- Develop a strong sense of self and values before acquiring wealth to mitigate negative changes
- Seek happiness and contentment independent of financial status
- Be mindful of the potential negative effects of extreme wealth and fame on personality
- Strive for personal growth and character development regardless of financial situation
- Consider the long-term psychological impacts of pursuing extreme wealth
- Maintain close relationships and accountability as wealth increases
- Regularly assess your behavior and values as your financial situation changes

# Key Points

- **Money amplifies existing traits:** If you're happy, more money may increase happiness. If depressed, money likely won't help much.
- **Wealth doesn't guarantee contentment:** Even extremely wealthy individuals like J. Paul Getty can still be unhappy and envious of others.
- **Fame and fortune change people:** Examples like Elon Musk and Donald Trump show how significant wealth and fame can alter personalities.
- The ability to "afford to be different" often leads to personality changes when people acquire substantial wealth.
- While money can improve life quality, it's not a cure-all for underlying issues or unhappiness.

**0:00**

if you are already happy gaining more

**0:02**

money will probably make you happier but

**0:05**

if you're already kind of depressed

**0:06**

gaining more money is probably not going

**0:07**

to help that much there's a really

**0:09**

interesting documentary about Jay Paul

**0:10**

Getty who uh used to be the richest man

**0:12**

in the world and I think that the

**0:14**

interview is taking place in the 1960s

**0:16**

or 1970s in his castle in England and it

**0:19**

is a Bonafide castle like straight out

**0:21**

of a fiction book and he's sitting there

**0:23**

in this like 700 foot long dining room

**0:27**

surrounded by gold and diamonds like the

**0:29**

most ostentatious thing you can see and

**0:30**

the interviewer says who are you envious

**0:32**

of and the interviewer says like

**0:34**

obviously everyone's envious of you who

**0:35**

are you envious of and the guy he's so

**0:38**

morose he's so glum and he just kind of

**0:40**

looks down and he says people who are

**0:42**

happier than me and it was like that's

**0:44**

the case money didn't money didn't help

**0:46**

him because he was already depressed and

**0:48**

in that situation it's it's not going to

**0:49**

do much but I think if you are the kind

**0:51**

of person who already has a chipper

**0:53**

disposition you're already happy then

**0:55**

getting more money will probably improve

**0:57**

your life that I think is kind of an

**0:59**

unfortunate I don't just like because so

**1:01**

many people who are depressed will think

**1:04**

to themselves if only I had money it

**1:06**

would fix everything and it it's

**1:08**

probably not the case there's a really

**1:09**

great quote in Will Smith's biography

**1:12**

where he says when Will Smith was poor

**1:14**

and depressed he could say to himself if

**1:16**

only I had more money everything would

**1:18**

be better and then when he was rich and

**1:20**

depressed he he didn't have that hope

**1:22**

anymore he li like money actually

**1:24**

subtracted The Hope from his life

**1:25**

because he realized there's nothing else

**1:27**

to strive for so I think that's the case

**1:29**

if you're already depressed that's who

**1:31**

you're going to be when you're rich and

**1:33**

this is just highlighting something that

**1:34**

a million people have said and everyone

**1:36**

already knows is that money just

**1:37**

accentuates who you are if you're a jerk

**1:39**

it's going to make you more of a jerk if

**1:40**

you're happy it's probably going to make

**1:41**

you happier it's like power or alcohol

**1:44**

or many drugs it's an amplifier exactly

**1:48**

one of the thing that's really

**1:49**

interesting to

**1:50**

me the new biography of Elon Musk Walter

**1:53**

Isaacson is interviewing mus first wife

**1:56**

whose name is Justine and she met Elon

**1:58**

in college before he was any successful

**2:00**

he was just an immigrant from South

**2:02**

Africa he didn't have any money no

**2:03**

success that's when she met him and she

**2:05**

talks about how much money and fame

**2:07**

changed him it just completely altered

**2:09**

his personality the other thing that

**2:10**

I've always found interesting is that if

**2:12**

you go back and look at an interview of

**2:13**

Donald Trump in the early 1980s there

**2:15**

are several of them you can find on

**2:16**

YouTube when he was known but not famous

**2:19**

and he was probably wealthy but not rich

**2:22**

you would not recognize him utterly

**2:23**

different person very calm very measured

**2:26**

very reasonable and even if you are a

**2:29**

huge Trump fan I think you would be

**2:30**

stunned at who the person is on camera

**2:32**

so any of us me you anyone if we became

**2:36**

into that level of Fame and power and

**2:38**

money it would change us and there

**2:41**

there's another quote from J Paul Getty

**2:43**

where he says nobody would be the same

**2:45**

if they could afford to be different and

**2:47**

I think that's a sad quote but I think

**2:49**

there's a lot of do that he says nobody

**2:51**

would be the same if they could afford

**2:54**

to be

**2:55**

different what do you think he meant by

**2:57**

that I think he was probably mentioning

**2:59**

in the sense of does money make you

**3:03**

happier does money change who you are

**3:05**

and I think all of us want to imagine

**3:08**

that if you and I stumbled across a

**3:10**

billion dollars tomorrow we would be the

**3:12**

same people we would have the same

**3:13**

friends the same interests the same

**3:15**

Hobbies the same disposition the same

**3:18**

personality and I think there's enough

**3:20**

examples of this where the answer is we

**3:22**

would not yeah there are probably some

**3:25**

exceptions that we could think of but I

**3:27**

think every single person who comes into

**3:29**

that kind of money is a different person

**3:30**

becomes a different person I wonder if

**3:32**

they become a different person or if

**3:34**

it's similar to the quote I wish I could

**3:38**

recall the attribution but adversity

**3:40**

doesn't build character it reveals it I

**3:42**

wonder if it's it's kind of like

**3:44**

watching someone with money interact

**3:47**

with a waiter or a waitress who's having

**3:50**

a tough first day or a busy section when

**3:54**

people don't need to be nice anymore how

**3:56**

do they behave yes I think that's

**3:57**

exactly it whereas when you're still in

**3:59**

build mode on some level especially if

**4:02**

you're socially aware you're playing I

**4:04**

shouldn't say all people most people are

**4:06**

going to play the game consciously or

**4:07**

subconsciously be on better Behavior but

**4:09**

when you really have [ __ ] you money

**4:12**

right how often do you actually say [ __ ]

**4:14**

you right I think that's maybe a measure

**4:16**

of what was a kernel of the personality

**4:19**

or the hidden personality the better

**4:21**

hidden personality beforehand also I

**4:24**

don't want to end on basically if you

**4:27**

think your life sucks now doesn't matter

**4:29**

what money you make you're probably

**4:30**

going to still think your life sucks cuz

**4:32**

it's pretty now even if it's true it's

**4:35**

sort of a sour note to end this chapter

**4:38**

of the conversation on so I want to

**4:40**

explore it a little bit further but what

**4:42**

were you going to say well I was going

**4:43**

to say I was in Omaha Nebraska last week

**4:45**

obviously waren Buffett's Hometown and I

**4:47**

was driving along the freeway and

**4:48**

there's a giant building one of the

**4:50**

tallest buildings in town that on top of

**4:52**

the building in enormous probably 50

**4:54**

foot letters says Buffett Cancer

**4:57**

Research Center so he's funded it he's

**4:59**

bought it

**5:00**

Warren drives past that building every

**5:01**

day and sees that and there's no way

**5:04**

that seeing your name on something like

**5:06**

that there's no way that he's the same

**5:07**

Warren Buffett who drove past that

**5:09**

building when he was 13 yeah it's going

**5:11**

to completely change just your view of

**5:12**

who you are in the world to your point

**5:14**

about let's not leave this on a sad note

**5:16**

because you're right it's I I I I do

**5:18**

think money can be used to give yourself

**5:19**

a better life what the distinction we

**5:21**

need to make is the distinction between

**5:23**

happiness and contentment does money buy

**5:26**

happiness I think that answer is pretty

**5:27**

firmly no can money buy contentment I

**5:30**

think that's a pretty firm yes and

**5:32**

that's great contentment is a great

**5:34**

trait that makes your life better but

**5:35**

it's very different from happiness could

**5:37**

you just Define that term so we

**5:39**

understand what we're talking about I

**5:41**

would say happiness is you wake up

**5:42**

grinning ear to ear happiness is you're

**5:45**

out at a bar with your friends happiness

**5:46**

is you hear the funniest joke you've

**5:47**

ever heard and that's what I think

**5:49**

people strive for and they think that

**5:50**

money is going to give to them and it

**5:51**

won't but I think contentment is you

**5:53**

just wake up with a low or virtually no

**5:56**

level of anxiety you're like I'm good

**5:58**

I'm pretty satisfied with my career I'm

**6:00**

satisfied with my relationships I'm

**6:01**

satisfied with the house that I live in

**6:03**

that's not happiness though so I think

**6:05**

money can reduce the number of sad days

**6:08**

that you have but it's probably not

**6:09**

going to increase the number of happy

**6:11**

days that you have now that's awesome

**6:13**

like if you can do that that's a huge

**6:14**

life Improvement but it's not happiness
