==**Every behaviour has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive**==

  

==**A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive**==

  

==**Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you’ll see that it does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying motives of human nature**==

  

==**Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices.**==

  

==**There are many different ways to address the same underlying motive**==

  

==**One person might learn to reduce stress by smoking a cigarette. Another person learns to ease their anxiety by going for a run.**==

  

==**Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face, they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.**==

  

==**Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not**==

  

==**Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment**==

  

==**You are endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment**==

  

==**The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them**==

  

==**Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply**==

  

==**A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state.**==

  

==**Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future**==

  

==**Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make a change. They help us decide the best course of action**==

  

==**It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent**==

  

==**To summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives. Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again**==

  

==**Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment**==

  

### How to reprogram your brain to enjoy hard habits

  

==**You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience**==

  

==**Now imagine changing just one word: You don’t have to. You get to.**==

  

==**You transition from seeing these behaviours as burdens and turn them into opportunities.**==

  

==**The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them**==

  

==**Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive**==

  

==**You can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation**==

  

==**Find something that makes you truly happy, and then create a short routine that you perform every time before you do the thing you love**==

  

==**The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them. It’s not easy, but if you can reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habits into an attractive one.**==
