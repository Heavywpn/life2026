==**Habit formation is the process by which a behaviour becomes progressively more automatic through repetition**==

  

==**Neurons that fire together wire together**==

  

==**Repeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain**==

  

==**Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit associated with that habit. This means that simply putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit**==

==**Habits form based on frequency, not time**==

==**What matters is the rate at which you perform the behaviour**==

  

==**It’s the frequency that makes the difference**==

  

==**To build a habit, you need to practice it**==
