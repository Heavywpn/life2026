with health in0:18mind it was created with profits in mind i don't think that we got here overnight and I think we just ignored the problem0:25until we are at the point where the cost of healthcare

gone on for decades and the reason why the majority of people are just walking around probably 60% of0:44their true state of normal and just believing that this is a consequence of aging just because it's happening to a0:50lot of people and it's becoming normalized does not mean that it's okay that does not have to be your experience0:56so where does this go in a perfect world where does your mission can you have the greatest effect that's a great question1:03if I could just change one thing that has been the basis of my entire business and my message is that we need to be1:17ultimate

to have you this is so much fun we were talking earlier on my podcast about how we just felt like little kids we're just like so excited i'm just so2:26excited to be in this industry and so excited to to the caliber of people that we get to associate with and the2:32sincerity of the commitment of most of the people in our industry our peer group it's just everybody wants to see2:39the tide raise all of our boats yes and we're all on the same mission to just better humanity and I I find that2:47there's a lack of arrogance and a sincere fabric of authenticity in this community and everyone wants to see2:55everyone else thrive and it's just very unique I think to a lot of you know3:01different industries out there so we are both very very blessed to be a part of this yeah um and you've had kind of an3:07interesting journey which I I find fascinating and I really think that yourCourtney Swan’s Journey and Passion on Food3:13influence is now beginning to be recognized to the point where you're3:18able to have a bigger voice and potentially make a bigger impact so talk a little bit about um your journey to3:25becoming this advocate for food real Foodie is her podcast if you haven't3:30seen it you've got to check out Real Food i was just on it so at a minimum watch my my3:37episode um but talk a little bit about the genesis of this how did it become your purpose your passion like what3:44ignited it for you yeah it was a it was a journey for me to get there for sure3:49we had talked about this earlier off camera but I I started out working in music actually uh my mom had really3:55planted the seeds for me when I was a kid because she was buying organic and natural food before it was even a4:01movement or a thing and when I was a kid like most kids you don't realize how good you have it right like I I was4:07watching all my friends eating the Dunkaroos and getting Burger King every night for dinner and I was upset and then I was going home to my amazing4:14organic home-cooked meals that my mom would my mom would be in the kitchen almost for two hours every night making4:20everything which you despised her for at the time oh I despised her at the time they're like \"What about Lucky Charms Mom?\" Yeah i was like \"I want the4:25McDonald's like I want a Happy Meal.\" And now I mean obviously I am so beyond grateful i went to college um I started4:33eating fast food and I don't even recognize who that person is anymore but you know I was eating in the dining hall4:38which is you know Cisco and Shamrock Foods catering and and I I gained a bunch of weight i got acne I'd never had4:44before i was fatigued and I it wasn't until I took a nutrition course and also4:49my mom had sent me a book on nutrition and it was literally just called you are what you eat wow and cuz I was looking4:55for answers right but I was looking in all the wrong places i was eating Slim Fast bars for breakfast and thinking5:00that I was going to lose weight and like get healthy which is so ironic right and I found this book it's called You Are5:06What You Eat and it really just it was talk about a light bulb moment for me it made me really understand oh wow the5:12things that I'm putting in my body the food that I'm eating is quite literally building my cells and it's going to either determine whether I have good5:18energy and I'm going to be at a healthy weight and I'm not going to you know be inflamed all the time or it's going to drive all of that right and it's so5:25funny looking back to that now thinking how much of a light bulb moment that was for me but it really lit a fire under my5:30ass because I quite to be quite frank I was pretty mad that I had not learned that sooner because I was uh probably 205:37at that point and you were in college and I was thinking why aren't we teaching small children this why doesn't5:42every human know this and I was also thinking too looking at all my um you know my my parents' friends and like5:47older generations and a lot of them still hadn't figured it out and I was so flabbergasted for lack of a better word5:54because I was like this is so simple right it's so simple um the things that we're eating and we're putting in our bodies are either fighting disease or6:02fueling it you know and so that really ignited a passion in me and then I just6:07could not get enough information I found Michael Pollen back then when he was writing about food um I found Dr mark6:14Heyman i think I read one of his very first books love him yeah and he introduced me to this world of6:19functional and integrative medicine which is you know root cause disease protocol um where you're looking at the6:25root cause and you're looking for the root cause and trying to u mitigate symptoms with diet and lifestyle changes so that really affected me a lot i was6:31in school or sorry I was actually touring at the time um I finally decided in the music industry exactly so I was6:37with the music industry um I decided to quit that and I went back and I got my masters of science in nutrition and6:44integrative health wow and then actually during that time I got pulled back on the road and I ended up being a6:50nutritionist for four years for a pop star really yeah which was pretty amazing so cool and it was very cool6:55because it was you know I got to kind of blend both of my favorite worlds which was nutrition and then being on tour and and getting to work for musicians which7:02was so much fun but I did hit a point where um you know we kind of talked about this on my podcast that it was7:07really starting to to really like tax my body like I just was feeling the effects of not getting enough sleep and you know7:14it is harder to eat healthy and so I finally in 2019 decided to no longer tour anymore and I had been building7:20real foodology on the side and at the time it really was more just of a hobby i really had no plan i had no like goals7:27or plans of turning this into anything other than it started with a passion where I felt like this was information7:33that people largely didn't know and I was seeing so many people suffer and like you just said a minute ago I want7:38to see people thrive and so I started Real Food as a blog and I was just kind of Instagramming my my touring life and7:45then in 2019 I was like you know what i'm going to pursue this full-time started my podcast in 2020 wow 20207:51that's that's awesome yeah yeah and then it just kind of has exploded from there that's so great you know I I think too7:58that you know sometimes when we travel we realize that you know you go to Italy and you have a bowl of pasta and a8:04basket of bread maybe a glass of wine and you feel amazing um in fact some8:09people will travel to European countries and lose weight even though eating high carbohydrates pizza pasta yeah I8:15remember when the the research came out on the blue zones and I was I was8:21watching the documentary on the blue zones and I was reading the book on it and I read Dr walter Longo's book on the8:26longevity diet and I realized you know there's there's no continuity between8:32diets that are helping people live to be hypercentinarians meaning it wasn't8:37carnivore keto paleo pescatarian vegan vegetarian it wasn't the hyperd dogmatic diets it was just whole food yes like8:45just real food yes and you know in the States a lot of our food is just not8:51even food and and I wonder if we could talk about that for a minute because without sounding like fearmongers you8:58know a part of what I believe our industry and people like yourself are trying to do is just help people get9:03around the system and and just get to back to the basics almost right i mean I9:11feel like if most people just got sunlight touched the surface of the earth focused on their sleep hydrated9:17some minerals ate old foods I mean just those basics would have a such a9:23dramatic impact on on on their life and so I know that you're very connected to9:28and enormous supporter of the of the Maha movement we talked a little bit about it on on your podcast i wonder if9:35we might just delve into some of the the sinister things that have gone on for9:40decades um that are really leading to this chronic disease epidemic that we9:46have and the reason why the majority of people are just walking around probably9:5260% of their true state of normal and just believing that this is a consequence of aging9:58so that is one of the biggest myths in in all of this in the nutrition wellnessBiggest Myth in Nutrition and Wellness10:04and medical system that really drives me nuts is that people just think \"Oh that's this is just what happens you10:09start aging and then you don't feel that well and your energy plummets and then you know you maybe have to go on a couple med medications and maybe you get10:16diabetes oh that's just aging i hear that all the time it's just oh well it's just part of being human that does not10:22have to be your experience yeah and I think it's normalized not to cut you off but I think it's normalized too because at certain ages your whole peer group is10:29experiencing the same thing they're like \"Yeah well none of us really sleep well and we don't remember anything i can't find my car keys and my belt and my10:35wallet.\" And and they're like \"Oh it's normal.\" Because all my friends are doing the same thing spare tire that I I never really had but all my friends do10:41and and I'm on three meds but all of my buddies are on three meds and my wife's on three or four meds yes and I and I10:48think that normalization almost makes it feel like it's just a part of quote unquote what10:54happens but exactly but just because it's happening to a lot of people and it's becoming normalized does not mean11:00that it's okay and that it should be happening i agree and Yeah and you know a lot of this is11:06largely driven by the fact that we are for the most part not really eating food anymore 60% of Americans d Americans11:13diets are coming from ultrarocessed foods 60% that's more than half of our diet what does it mean to be11:18ultrarocessed i think a lot of people don't understand what that means i mean does that mean that we just take a cow11:24and slaughter it and chop it into steaks and package it and send it or No so that would be processing yeah so there's a11:30there's a lot of discrepancy between like processing versus ultrarocessed because I see some of these like RDS or11:35dissenting voices out there that are saying \"Oh well uh applesauce is processed bread is processed.\" So that11:41is absolutely true but there is a huge difference between eating applesauce that maybe is just made with apple and11:47maybe add a little bit of sugar and some water versus if you were going to go to McDonald's and get an apple pie so the11:52difference between ultrarocessed and just something simply processing that we've been doing since the dawn of time11:57is with ultrarocessed foods you're adding a ton of additives and preservatives and fillers in there and that food no longer resembles what that12:05natural state of food once was i I often I often tell people if your grandparents12:11were to time travel or maybe like your great-grandparents like someone who's no longer alive if they were to time travel and you just dropped them into 2025 and12:17you took them to a grocery store and you showed them all these food products that were eating oh my god they probably wouldn't even know what where it came12:23from like they wouldn't even tell be able to tell you just by looking at it like \"Oh I know that that is from potatoes.\" They would be like \"What what12:29is that?\" Right that would be something that would be ultrarocessed foods soldier processed foods are made with a12:35bunch of ingredients that you would not normally have in your kitchen they're a bunch of ingredients that you find in factories and my argument and the whole12:42reason that I started real foodology my whole thing was when I came up with that name 14 years ago is I sat down and I12:47thought what's going to stand the test of time when it comes to nutrition and health we always need to be coming back12:52to eating real food that's so true and that has been the basis of my entire business and my message is that we need12:59to be getting back to eating real food and right now more than or the majority of our calories are coming from these13:07ultrarocessed foods you know what's amazing is I I still remember going into my um grandmother's basement GrandmaThe Shift in Eating Real Foods to Ultra-Processed Foods13:13Rose who I named my daughter after um so my grandmother um Rose Brea she in her13:19basement which was always like a little cool were all these like canned vegetables everywhere and she would she would every year you know she would can13:25vegetables and she would make like sauerkrauts and kimchi and pickles and all of this stuff i always thought it was like a little weird um but I I13:33really identify with it now and I remember you used to press the lid and if the if the lid was still tight she was like \"Yeah bring it upstairs if the13:39lid pops throw it in the trash.\" Yes and um I still remember I'm like \"This is so weird.\" Because I was here last13:46Christmas and that pickle was right there you know so something tells me I shouldn't bring this up and eat it um13:53but it made so much sense they didn't have preservatives and they didn't have13:58the you know um thickening agents and all a lot of these artificial ingredients and so they preserved them14:04naturally through the fermentation process which actually made them more healthy and you know like fermented14:09vegetables one of the healthiest things you can put in your body i try to eat a lot of kimchi and sauerkraut and get the14:15soluble and insoluble fibers um but you know I think we've we've modernized things and I don't think that we got14:23here overnight i think we got here really slowly and I think we just14:28ignored the problem until we are at call it pandemic levels crisis levels14:34whatever you want to call it i mean we are at the point where I think from a financial14:40perspective that you know the the cost of healthcare could break the entire system oh yeah right um I don't think14:46people understand how detrimental it is actually I don't think so either i wonder if you might talk about that a little bit and I want to go into some of14:52the chemicals specifically like glyphosate you know we hear about these things um but we don't really know how14:58do they get into our food supply why are they in our food supply um is there some kind of sinister profit motive behind it15:04and if so like you know what can we do to to address it yeah so I largely believe that most of this stuff started15:10with good intention the problem is is that now that we have the data and the science and we know that these chemicalsChemicals in Our Food Supply15:17and certain processing you know things that we're doing with our food we now know that they are harming people and15:23now it is to the point where it is becoming sinister in my opinion but I don't think it started out that way largely a lot of what we're dealing with15:29now which is an industrialization of our food system was started because of the war you know after the war um there was15:35famine people or our president was genuinely concerned about getting enough food to people having it be cheap15:40accessible fast so that's when we started paying subsidies to farmers because they thought okay what crops can15:46we grow just rows and rows and rows of grow them really fast and then commodit15:52commodi commoditize them commoditize commoditize them why was that so hard for me to get out you actually said a15:57word on the podcast last time that was the first time I'd ever heard it i needed to go infantilize maybe infantilize that was the word i almost I16:06almost fact checked you on that because I was like I've never heard of it but the context I got it so it is really a16:13word it is well I say you regardless and lots of other things that are not words but that's that's really good it's rare16:19that I hear a word and I'm like \"Wow that's a new one.\" It's fun i've been I've been trying to to broaden my You're16:25going to hear it start popping into my podcast right i hope I use it well be like \"Oh Gary got that from me.\" Not to16:32infantilize you but But if you want protein to build lean16:37muscle but without the caloric impact or need to cut you need perfect amino it's pure essential amino acids the building16:44blocks of proteins in a precise form and ratio that allows for near 100%16:50utilization in building lean muscle and no caloric impact so we build protein16:55six times as much as whey but without the excess body fat we normally get during bulking this is the new era of17:02protein supplementation and it's real if you want to build lean muscle without having to cut you need perfect amino17:09when it comes to snacking Masa is flipping the script on what real food should look like masa chips are crafted17:15with grass-fed beef tallow one of the healthiest fats on the planet these chips are packed with essential vitamins17:21like vitamin A D E and vitamin K2 all of which play a role in keeping your skin17:26vibrant your immune system strong and your bones solid but here's the real magic about Masa masa's corn goes17:33through an ancient process called nyx stimilization which makes it way easier to digest and it amps up its nutrient17:39profile plus these chips are low in pufas so you won't find any of the inflammatory seed oils that you find in17:45most snacks and instead masa uses pure Redmond sea salt giving you a natural17:50hit of minerals that keep your cells hydrated and your energy steady so don't just snack reach for Masa it's real food17:57real health without any of the junk grab a bag and I promise you'll feel the difference now let's get back to the18:03Ultimate Human podcast so historically you think that you know obviously after the war we needed to promulleate crops18:09and we need to have them less expensive and more readily available and there was also this notion which we're still18:15seeing today is that they wanted to feed the world so this is when we started introducing things like glyphosate for18:20example which is one that I really am hyperfocused on right now i'm incredibly concerned about glyphosate um over 90%18:27of Americans were finding glyphosate in their urine and it's coming up in placenta it's coming up in breast milk i18:32had it in my my urine i did the vibrant wellness test yeah even those of us that are eating organic and we're doing18:38really hard and we're doing saunas and we're detoxing we are all finding it in our blood and it is so incredibly concerning so glyphosate is an herbicide18:45um it's also known as Roundup which was created by Monsanto now in 2018 Bayer18:51which is a pharmaceutical company bought Monsanto and now they are also a agrochemical company and they own a18:57majority of our food system now because they have patented genetically modified seeds which are corn um wheat and or19:04sorry we just started genetically modifying wheat recently but corn and soy are the majority of those now during19:09the war what we did is we started paying subsidies to farmers what are subsidies these come from taxpayer dollars and19:15it's money that we give to farmers in order to incentivize them to grow specific crops wow now some of the crops19:20that we do with that are corn and soy now it's why I would encourage everybody19:25listening if you have any ultrarocessed foods in your cabinet I would go and I would read the label and I would argue19:31that almost every single one of them that you pick up it's going to say may contain corn wheat and soy really19:36they're in everything because we are paying farmers to grow them so we have them in surplus and it's cheaper it's19:44more accessible um it's more affordable again we have it in excess so we're using it in everything and so not only19:50is it being pushed into our ultrarocessed foods in the forms of you know vegetable oils um all of our19:55processed grains uh corn syrup is a really big one wow yeah high fructose corn syrup corn syrup yeah we're also20:01using that to feed our livestock so we're also getting it on the other end in our meat our dairy and our eggs m and20:08glyphosate is incredibly concerning um it has very concerning back very concerning backstory so this is actually20:14what I did my Senate speech on i was uh so grateful to be a part of this round20:20table this nutrition round table it was hosted by Senator Ron Johnson back in September and it was with Vonnie Hari uh20:27Michaela Peterson Jordan Peterson RFK Jr cali and Casey Means i remember that it20:32was so amazing yeah some some of the talks that you guys gave were so impactful i mean thankfully a lot of20:38those videos have gone viral i've had the majority of those people on my podcast and it was so impactful i20:44actually remember seeing Cali Means um on the Tucker Carlson show with his20:49sister and for someone that is you know as woke whatever you want to call it and20:55aware of the biohacking community nutrition in general um I was blown away because he laid out the sequence of21:02corruption and I and I think that those two particularly have a really interesting skill set and background21:08even though now they have a shared mission you know one coming from a very alopathic I think she was a head neck surgeon from Stanford yeah um and and21:16then he came from highly educated um and he came from the you know the political21:23side of things where he was lobbyist yeah he was working for as a lobbyist for companies like Coca-Cola yeah so21:29it's fascinating because he has a really he had a look under the hood that many people are not actually revealing to the21:36general public which was fascinating i had him on my podcast a couple years ago and same thing i was blown away because21:41a lot of what he is saying he's just validating what a lot of us have been trying to say for years and he came out21:46and he said \"Yeah this is all true i was literally in the boardrooms.\" Yeah a part of these conversations yeah it was21:51part of my job to influence politicians for these certain outcomes and I think he just woke up one day and was like21:58\"Wait a second this is all wrong.\" I mean when he started talking about the intentionality of it um that's whatMajority of Food on the Shelves Are Created with Profits in Mind, Not Our Health22:06really began to sway my opinion it's one thing to be doing something and not know22:12it's another to know intentionally continue and intentionally and22:17aggressively cover it up to the point where you're actually willing to ruin somebody else's life or smy's reputation22:23you know armed children um you know that's when you realize the sinister intention of it and one of the things he said I'll never forget was that uh his22:31group had five lobbyists for every member of Congress that's nuts so so I'm22:38just thinking man if you're So if you're a member of Congress and this is only one group you know one lobbying group22:43has five lobbyists assigned to you and he was like it was our role to try to take up all their calendar slots22:49contribute to their campaigns support their events whine dine them whine them dine them um and and to try to just22:57overwhelm them with meetings and appointments and and and essentially try to take up as much of their bandwidth as23:02they they possibly could um and that's when I realized man we have more of an23:08intentionality behind this than than I thought you know just like you said I don't think it began with sinister23:14intentions right we need you have famine you need to feed the nation yep um and then it just grew into this big chemical23:20agricultural industry a lot of which is wholly unnecessary now exactly and and23:27humanity is is paying the price exactly like again you know at the time I think23:32it was great it was this modern technology oh my gosh what do you mean we don't have to can everything now we can just add these additives and23:37preservatives in there that will prolong the shelf life this is what many people need to understand is that the majority23:43of the food on our shelves was not created with health in mind it was created uh with profits in mind because23:49they want it to be shelf stable so that it can stay it can stay on the shelf for long periods of time right i was doing23:55this little like personal experiment at my house um still kind of ongoing and I've released two videos about this24:00already but I bought just a bunch of conventional bread loaves of bread from the grocery store in December i got24:06Sarah Lee and some other like December yeah it's what April now exactly it's almost April those bags have been open24:14they've just been opened sitting on my counter and since December and there is not a drop of mold on any single one of24:20them not nothing they smell quote unquote fresh like it's still squishy24:26it's not dry really yes wow oil that's the preservatives that's the additives24:32that's Wow folic acid ex yep exactly all of those things so you're hyperfocused24:38on glyphosate because um you know they call it a forever chemical and I'm I'd24:45love for you to define what that means um but why glyphosate in particular so24:51glyphosate well first of all the reason I'm most concerned about it is because it's it's become so ubiquitous so we're24:57spraying it on all of our fields um the the backstory of glyphosate is uh they25:02were using a lot of these chemicals in uh World War II nazis were using them in nerve as nerve agents in gas chambers25:09they weren't using glyphosate specifically but they were using known insecticides and pesticides and theyRisks of Glyphosate in Our Foods25:16have similar chemical components to glyphosate um and then same with the Vietnam War uh Agent Orange was created25:22by Monsanto um so now fast forward these agrochemical companies need somewhere to25:27use their chemicals and their fertilizers and so they pivoted to spraying them on farmlands and what25:33happened initially is they said \"Oh they're totally fine these are not harmful at all to to health.\" So the25:38farmers are spraying down their crops everything and the glyphosate was killing everything including the plants25:44that they were trying to grow so what happened was they genetically modified seeds they genetically modified plants to grow to where they could just spray25:51the fields with glyphosate and everything would get covered in glyphosate and the plant itself wouldn't die but it would kill everything else25:57off well here's the issue with that and this is where I get super passionate about something called regenerative26:02farming because the soil we talk a lot about soil health so glyphosate also acts like an antibiotic which means that26:08it's not only killing off bad bacteria but it's also killing off the good bacteria wow and we talked about how a lot of people are consuming glyphosate26:15and they're getting it in their bodies and then everyone's having all these you know IBS and Crohn's and gut issues and26:20antibiotic resistance exactly well it's no wonder because all of us are consuming an antibiotic almost on a26:25daily basis and we don't even know and on top of that it's not labeled it doesn't need to be on the label soFeeding Garbage to the Livestock Animals26:31people can be consuming it and they have no clue um now the where my passion really comes in in all this is that when26:36we're spraying our soil with glyphosate because it's an antibiotic we're killing off the entire ecosystem of the soil26:42that makes the plants healthy in the first place i don't know if you've heard this before but I've heard this quoted often we are only as healthy as our soil26:49is no doubt because our plants are growing in our soil and if our soil does not have the ecosystem the bacteria the26:55bugs there's this whole ecosystem that half of what we probably still don't even understand what's going on there we're killing all of that the soil is27:01barely hanging on and then we think that the plants that are going to grow out are going to come out with enough vitamins minerals and nutrients for us27:07absolutely not and when you leave nature to do what it is intended to do what it's meant to do which is a thing called27:13regenerative farming there's this I love this I there's this incredible process that happens called carbon sequestration27:20where carbon is actually pulled out of the atmosphere because a lot of people were super concerned for good reason about there being too much carbon in the27:25atmosphere if we leave nature to do her thing she pulls the carbon out of the atmosphere and that is actually food for27:31the soil and if we're not spraying it with all these chemical interventions we're letting the soil thrive with the27:37bacteria and the bugs and everything that it's meant to be and how it's meant to be there the carbons in the soil and27:42it's this really deep rich like beautiful black soil that's going to be food for the plants and we see so many27:50articles now saying \"Oh our our food is losing you know it's devoid of vitamins minerals and nutrients.\" You talk about27:55this all the time yeah I talk about it all the time you know it's funny i I I love the book that you read we are What28:01but but I think we're we're also what we eat eats yes right and which is getting28:06you closer to the soil i mean I I totally agree when you have you know when we feed livestock um you know if28:13you've ever driven by a commercial feed lot um it's it's really kind of a sad28:19sad place you know it's just acres and acres of dirt and mud no grass as far as28:24the eye can see feed troughs you know which are very often corn soybean um28:30millet these other things um and I've even there's a butcher in Naples that28:35I'm I'm friends with and they stopped buying meat from a certain uh farm and28:40he said they were actually adding high fructose corn syrup to the feed um and the meat was so full of pus because the28:48because they were sick because the animals were dying of type 2 diabetes right before they were slaughtered they28:53were on their way to dying from from um type two diabetes i mean where in nature's does a cow run into high28:58fructose corn syrup and he said it was actually causing the their teeth to rot all the way up into the gums because29:03they so they would lose their teeth so they couldn't really couldn't really chew and I love cows that actually breaks my heart yeah I do too i love29:11animals in general i mean but Yes well I saw something online too and a farmer actually verified this to me um they're29:18starting to feed candy to our livestock now too just to fatten them up they don't even think about the nutritional29:23value anymore of like oh how can we feed them so that they're you know healthy and they get enough nutrients no they're just like how can we fatten them up as29:30fast and quick as possible so they're feeding them candy bars they'll just throw candy bars in their feed and sometimes they don't even take the29:35wrappers off I heard yeah it's Yeah i mean you see a lot of those u you know videos of the uh especially especially29:42pigs that are eating Yes garbage but a lot of it has plastic in it i mean they don't even take the take the plastic out29:48of it so so where does this go so you know glyphosate is an issue and um you29:54know for the first time maybe in our whole lifetime there is potential opportunity to affect public policy30:00because of people like yourself going and speak in front of Congress um and the whole Maha movement which I think is30:07just phenomenal no matter what side of the aisle you're on you've got to be pro- nutrition prohealthy food because30:12we all deserve especially our children deserve clean food so where does this go30:17in a in a perfect world where does your mission um where can you have theCourtney Swan’s Mission30:22greatest effect that's a great question i mean look if I could just change one30:28thing it would just be can we just get these additives out of our food and focus on real food i think a lot of it30:36is um there's an education component there because there's a large portion of the population that's been eating so30:42much foods out of packages that they one are scared to cook now or they feel like they can't cook or maybe it hasn't been30:48passed down through generations through them anymore so I definitely think there's an educational component there so how can we um really start like in30:56honestly what I would love to see is we start doing this in schools with kids you know have them when they're in kindergarten have them start tending a31:02garden and teach them the importance of growing your food and then show them how that food is then ending up on their31:09plates for lunch you know and then how can we have them have a cooking class you know i think this should start very31:14very early because there is a large education component there because now we're just tell because this is I have a31:21huge issue about this i actually just talked about this on a podcast yesterday we are telling people \"Oh you don't have31:27time to cook or it's so expensive don't even try.\" So I think so many people are not even trying anymore they're not even31:32attempting it because they just think like \"Okay well that's that's one that's too expensive for me and it's not going to be accessible for me and it's super31:38hard.\" We live in the most amazing time of information you can literally open Tik Tok open YouTube and just type in31:45any recipe you want to make and you can watch a video of it so you can very easily and I I think so many people are31:51scared to cook but it is so easy it doesn't have to be complicated grill up a steak right and then bake some sweet31:58potatoes and then add a little arugula on the side like done it does not have to be so hard so from a policy32:05standpoint what we need to do is a couple things i think first of all we need to stop paying subsidies for foods32:11that are driving our chronic disease m corn and soy like I said earlier are largely making up of the majority of the32:17food like products is it corn soy wheat those are the big ones yes corn soy are the majority yes so over 90% of our corn32:24is genetically modified and over 90% of our soy is genetically modified and those are a lot of what we're paying32:30subsidies for um and then wheat as well and then wheat is just now starting to be genetically modified and so that32:36means that it's it can withstand glyphosate so you hear all this you hear all this talk online saying \"Oh GMOs32:42actually means less pesticides.\" No the pesticides are quite literally in some of those seeds that are genetically modified and if they're not they're32:49having to spray everything like crazy with glyphosates so it actually means more pesticides not less yeah because if32:55something is um genetically modified to be resistant to glyphosate it's probably going to absorb and survive holding on33:02to the glyphosate i mean we already know that it not only it not only makes it into our food supply it makes it into33:08our blood it made it into my blood and if it's getting in mine it's getting in everybody's i promise you exactly33:13because we're eating organic and we're going above and beyond i mean I filter my water i filter my shower i'm eating33:19all organic in my home the only time I don't eat organic is when I'm eating out and I can't control it like many of you33:25the hardest thing for me is to shut off my mind at night when I want to sleep and it's funny because sometimes I'll33:30wake up tired already thinking of when I'll get back to bed again but exactly the moment that I lay my head on the33:36pillow it feels like the machine of crazy what if thoughts is turned back on does this happen to you let me tell you33:42my new secret to deal with this you may have heard of Magnesium

regenerative farming but I heard you say something that you know organic eating is now no longerOrganic Eating Should No Longer Be Negotiable34:59negotiable um and I wonder if you might describe organic eating organic food35:05labeling um because I think too that there is maybe it's not direct corruption but there's a lot of35:12misinformation if you will on organic food food labeling so for the average consumer walking into the grocery store35:19it's like okay um I'm going to sacrifice some other areas of my budget because35:24I'm going to make sure that my family is eating the cleanest you know organic food where do they start on that journey35:30yeah well first and foremost the reason I'm such a huge supporter of organic food in general is because there's a lot35:36of laws and regulations around what is allowed and what is allowed to be sprayed on organic food so legally by35:43law if it's stamped organic it means that it was not allowed to be sprayed by glyphosate um if it's meat or dairy it35:49wasn't allowed to be injected with growth hormones they're not allowed to give them you know pharmaceutical drugs there's a lot of laws around there also35:56they can't eat genetically modified crops wow with organics so if you buy organic meat Exactly you know that36:02they're not eating this pesticide laden grains right so that to me is the36:08biggest concern right now and why I feel like it's non-negotiable but what is so insidious about all this36:14is that organic is just what we should be eating there should not be two different options what I would love to36:19see is that we're just not using these pesticides anymore and organic is just the only option it's just food right36:26because you know 50 years ago when our grandparents were eating they were eating organic but they weren't labeling it organic it just was food it's so true36:32you know I heard Max Lou say on a podcast one time \"If your grocery store has a healthy food section what does36:38that tell you about the rest of the story what is the rest of it?\" Like I mean it was just so simple but I I've loved it i actually was in uh uh36:45Medigene Colombia a while back and we were eating in this restaurant and I ordered steak36:50and I asked the guy if the steak was grass-fed and he literally looked at me like I had two heads and and because you36:58know for him he was like \"What else do cows eat?\" like why are you asking me that of course it's grass-fed and and I37:05was it it just dawned on me i was like well in the States we have to ask this right we have we have to check i realize37:11here all they eat is grass because you guys got it right you know um which I think is part of the reason why you see37:18our life expectancy has dropped we talked about this on on your podcast but you know um has dropped to 66th in the37:24world you know beneath some countries that don't even have clean water and sanitation and I think in countries like37:32that um your only accessible food is is real is real food it's whole food and37:40this is supported by Blue Zone Research they were all eating whole food they didn't eat dogmatic diets there was you37:46know almost zero processed ingredients in in the diets of these centinarians um37:52plus they moved and they had a sense of community um but I want to I want to work my way back to regenerative farming37:57because there has to be an answer other than just stop poisoning the food because the what the chemical industry38:04is going to say is if we stop spraying glyphosate or if we stop spraying glyphosate on the crops all the pests38:11are going to eat it the you know the uh this is an herbicide the weeds are going to take over um and that's going to be38:16worse for your food than what you're getting in this small amount of micro38:22poisoning what we have as the grass guideline right that generally regarded as as safe and and I think that a lot of38:29these um guidelines are based on single dose toxicity meaning yeah if you go out38:37and eat an inorganic piece of um fish or chicken or you know traditionally fed38:42cow and some you know non-organic vegetables is that going to kill you in a single meal no but it's the cumulative38:48dose toxicity right over time exactly um that our our cellular biology just can't38:54handle anymore yeah and and our immune systems can't handle it anymore well we're seeing a really concerning trend39:00right now i would encourage people to Google this because you can actually look up photos so look you can neverThe Sustainability of Agriculture39:05outsmart nature nature always finds a way and what's happening with a lot of these weeds that were initially being39:10killed off by glyphosate you're seeing these crazy glyphosate resistant weeds39:15popping up everywhere that the farmers don't really know how to handle because they're no longer uh responding to the39:21glyphosate right and so it's again like nature always finds a way it's similar to like you know like the antibiotic resistance that we see when you're39:27taking too much antibiotics and we're seeing it a lot because we're we're giving it prophylactically to our livestock so there is yeah there's a39:35huge concern with that as well and um there's there's a lot of push back against the organic movement from the39:41agrochemical companies because they say well how are the farmers going to survive how are we going to feed the world how are we going to going to39:48create enough food for everyone and what I always tell people is there's this amazing farming systems trial that's39:53been going on for 40 years and what it is it's been an ongoing study that's still happening right now they've been doing it for 40 years through the Rodell40:00Institute and what they do is they have conventional farming on one side and then they have organic farming on the other side no it's incredible and what40:07they have found is that in this organic farming system it produces the same if40:13not sometimes even more yield than what the conventional is yielding and then on top of that it's sustainable because40:20what we're doing in our conventional model right now is we're getting to a point where we are desertifying the soil40:25yes and we're depleting it of so much nutrients that at some point you literally cannot plant there anymore and40:30you have to go somewhere else to plant and they are theorizing and if we continue down this path and we keep40:36ignoring this that we have about depending on who you talk to anywhere between like 52 to 54 harvests left40:42where we will no longer have soil that's plantable for plants wow so we need to40:47do something because what we're doing right now it's just a quick fix right it's not long-term sustainable and our40:54you know our grandkids are not even going to have soil left to plant in what is sustainable agriculture what is what41:01is regenerative farming um and and can we do that on a mass scale and still41:07allow farmers to be profitable and maybe clean up the food supply you know I get41:12a lot of my stuff here in Miami from this place called Southwest Ranches which is right down the street and they're hyper um vigilant about where41:21they source their meats their line caught fish their their their honey their you know their maple syrups you41:27know all of their raw raw dairies i can tell when I'm home and I'm eating that41:32type of food and then when I go on the road and my choices are limited um my wife can too like instantly um feel it41:40it's just like we were saying before when you go to Italy and you have a bowl of pasta and a basket of bread and you feel amazing and you come back here and41:46you have a bowl of pasta and a basket of bread and you blow up like a tick exactly yeah you blow up like a tick but um do41:54you have a hope that maybe under this Maha movement that the subsidies coming42:00from the taxpayer will go towards quality foods i really hope so that is42:06one of my number one dreams like hopes that we get out of Maja i know uh Robert42:11F kennedy Jr is incredibly passionate about regenerative farming and I know he knows about it and also too we know that42:18it can be done large scale i mean we have these farmers like Will Harris and Joel Salatin that have these hugeThe Possible Outcomes of Regenerative and Sustainable Farming is Subsidized42:24regenerative farms and they all came from the traditional conventional path and they switched over to regenerative42:31and they also um provide a lot of resources for farmers that want to switch over it's also healthier for the42:36farmers because they're not using all this glyphosate and all the other stuff that so many of these farmers no one is really talking about this so many of42:42these farmers are now getting non-hodkins lymphoma oh yeah they're getting crazy aggressive forms of cancer42:48from using these chemicals exactly but you know part of the issue42:53is that we need an entire reform of our food system here in America because right now we have I don't know the exact42:59number but we have a small amount of just really large industrialized farms43:04and then they're just shipping out everything across the country and what people don't realize is that an apple that you get at the grocery store has43:11probably been it was probably three weeks from being picked because Wow they picked it and then they sprayed it with43:17something in the truck that makes it ripen while it's on its trip to you and43:22then finally by the time you get it at the grocery store it was picked like 3 weeks ago and it was ripened in the back of a truck not on a tree right and we're43:29doing this largely across all of our our food systems so what we need to do is we need to incentivize farmers to go back43:35to regenerative farming we need more local farms yeah where we can get local produce from our communities and and and43:42do you think that um there'll be a point where we start to43:48subsidize regenerative farming and sustainable you know sustainable agriculture and we actually get back to43:55taking good care of the soil because I I see it in in our clinic system too you44:01know so many human beings are just nutrient deficient yes you know they're vitamin they're mineral they're amino44:07acid they're nutrient deficient and when you look at the importance of these nutrients in the human body you know how44:13our calcium and phosphorus form hydroxy appatite to create bones and that process needs 12 minerals um when we're44:21actually creating neurotransmitters which form the basis of our mood that process needs raw materials vitamins44:27which used to be prevalent in our food supply and they used to be prevalent in our fruits and our vegetables and now44:32it's it's just so um depleted i wonder if there's you know um you know an era44:41where we're not subsidizing non-foods we're actually subsidizing you know that44:47would be amazing why can't we subsidize whole real foods and encourage more local farmers to want to get back into44:53farming um I think a lot of these smaller farmers that are super passionate about all this they're they're all getting pushed out by these44:59big industrialized farms that are taking over everything and then they're just ruining our food supply and they'reThe Impact of the Chemical Industry on Our Health45:04spraying everything and they're conventionally farming and Yeah and your to your point um I mean you talk about45:09this all the time in the nutritional deficiencies americans are overfed and undernourished yes they're eating so45:15much we're actually overfed because we're undernourished which is really interesting exactly exactly right and45:20we're not getting enough nutrients from our foods because we're really not eating a lot of real foods anymore and then when we are we're they're devoid of45:28vitamins and minerals and nutrients that were there before and this is another argument for organic they do a lot of um45:34there's been a lot of studies and testing done and they find time and time again that conventional crops I you45:39think that the organic food is lower and devoid of nutrients and minerals and vitamins the conventionally grown has45:45like nothing left right so at least with organic it's higher in the vitamin minerals content mineral content and45:50it's still a lot lower than generations before but at least in organic it has higher amounts than the conventional45:56does you know and I think too that when you when you look at cellular biology I46:01mean these these deficiencies trace to very specific conditions and diseases and it's not like um all vaccines cause46:08autism all glyphosate causes cancer it's you know we it's this multiffactorial46:14thing where you know our food system has become so corrupt and I wonder if we46:19might even talk for a moment about the influence that the chemical industry has on our you know government and public46:26policy some of that's happening right now yeah and I want you to bring it up so that you disappear and I can continue46:31my podcast um my fiance is I always tell my audience I'm like if I disappear open46:37an investigation because I'm really really happy i'm like I love my family i love my wife yes not suicidal i love my46:45family i'm about to get married i'm very excited no I mean really honestly my fiance recently was like um are are you46:51are we good talking about some of this stuff publicly like are you going to be okay and I you know I'm very spiritual46:57and I I really believe that I came to earth with a purpose and my purpose is to help people thrive and wake them up47:05to I think it's greater than even the food system but I think right now currently my mission is to help people47:10wake up to their own innate power and knowingness about themselves and knowing how to feed themselves and how to take47:16care of themselves and how to thrive because the human body wants to be healthy we just need to give it the47:23right tools to and healthy can mean it's so much more than just diet right it's it's your mental state um it's your47:30community how much sleep you're getting like it's more than just the food but I really believe that I came here with a47:35purpose and I I just can't shut up so like sorry I'm not going to stop talking47:41about it and so I feel like I have a certain protection i know he's like Courtney you're going to get um but okay47:49so glyphosate so this is a this is where this is where it does47:55become insidious because now that they they know that this is happening so um I mentioned earlier Monsanto was bought48:01out by Bayer in 2018 and then shortly after that Mon or Bayer but which was before Monsanto started getting pulled48:08into a ton of litigations with mostly farmers but just Americans in general that were getting non-hodkins lymphoma48:14from glyphosate right to this day they have spent over $2 billion paying back48:20farmers and other Americans that have gotten non-hodkins lymphoma from glyphosate the ARC which is the48:26International Agency for Research on Cancer through the World Health Organization48:31says that glyphosate it classifies glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen now meaning that we probably48:38basically know that it causes cancer so this is why it's so incredibly concerning and now Bayer knows this um48:46but they are currently working and they're going state by state it's actually on the governor's desk right48:51now um in Georgia they're going state by state they're trying to go through their legislators through their senators to48:58get immunity from being sued if someone gets cancer so essentially if this passes in Georgia it would mean that if49:06you or I were farming or just in general if we were using glyphosate in our lawn and we got cancer and the research shows49:12that glyphosate's connected to cancer and we got the cancer and we're using the glyphosate we would not legally be allowed to sue them it's actually the49:18same thing that the vaccine companies went for in 1986 which is the immunity shield where if you get harmed by a49:23vaccine you can't hold the company liable right so that is mind-numbing to me i mean it's it's insidious why can't49:30we just stop using the chemicals but instead they're they're pushing back even further and they want to get this49:36immunity and if it passes through Georgia there's a huge concern that then it's just going to you know pass like wildfire throughout all the other states49:43wow so we're currently trying to block it in fact I post about it all the time on my Instagram um I post numbers that49:48you can call emails you can call i'm going to do that too yes yeah give me that information because I will stand with you on that so if I bring this back49:55to the consumer you know I'm a mother or father i'm listening to this podcast um50:00I'm concerned you've sort of woken me up to this uh what do I do tomorrow right i50:06mean how do I where do I start in the grocery store um you know without reallyActionable Steps People Can Start Doing to Improve Their Health50:11breaking my budget what are some ways to avoid some of the most sinister things because we're not going to shift50:18everybody's habits you know all the way overnight but I think a lot of people50:24hearing this are like willing to make incremental change yeah so where does that start with them around the kitchen50:31well okay i think first and foremost uh this is I would be remissed without talking about this you have to reframe50:39and understand that there may be a little bit of budgeting and reframing of priorities that has to happen because50:45unfortunately we are living in a time right now if you do not make time for your wellness you will be forced to make50:50time for your illness it is just that dire at this point and I'm not trying to scare anyone but I just I believe in50:57telling people the truth and if you know this then you're going to be way more inclined to actually want to take action51:04so some of that is okay instead of you know eating out for every meal or postmating everything or going to51:10Starbucks every single morning how can you make that coffee at home how can you stop getting food delivered every single51:17night how can you have just dinner out one night a week and make it more of a special thing and start focusing on51:23buying groceries and cooking at home it doesn't have to be these fancy you know five course meals it can be something really simple to make um I think also51:31too people think that fast food is cheap it is no longer cheap in fact I did a series on my podcast called Organic for51:38Everyone it was so much fun really yes my producer and I would go and we would buy really popular fast food items and51:44see how much the cost of that was like we did Taco Bell cheesy gordita crunch for example and then we also bought all51:50the ingredients to make that at home every single ingredient was organic we were buying it from super accessible stores like Walmart Ralph's Kroger51:58really okay every single ingredient was organic and then we made a copycat of that at home and every single time it52:03was cheaper to buy all organic groceries and make it at home than it was to go through the drive-thru oh that's so52:08amazing i'm I'm I I'm going on your Instagram and I'm going to re re I'm52:14going to I'm going to reforward all all of your videos and and and and put them up on my Instagram and if you want to52:19make me a collaborate on them I would love to help you get the message out because I do this similar thing called lateral shifts where um you know I'll52:28take anything that people like to eat and um I try to make them two promises one I won't change the flavor profile52:35and two I won't add a dime to their budget and I had a very similar experience um you know so people would52:41go to their you know refrigerator and and sometimes these are on lives you know we got thousands of people on and52:48they'll go to the refrigerator and they'll in the refrigerator and they'll say \"What do you like to eat in there?\" Like \"Oh I love this uh I won't say the52:54brand name but this yogurt brand with fruit on the bottom and it's all the individual like peel off bags.\" Like53:00\"Okay well let's spin that around.\" And you look at the back and it's like 54 grams of sugar high fructose corn syrup53:05there it is um natural fruit flavor you know which means ain't got no fruit and53:11um and and you say \"Well which one of those do you like to eat?\" \"Oh I like the blueberry.\" You say \"Okay so what53:16we're going to do is we're going to go to the grocery store we're going to buy a quart of whole fat Greek yogurt we're53:22going to take um a basket of organic blueberries and um we're going to get a bag of monk fruit and you're just going53:29to scoop some of that whole fat Greek yogurt in there you can throw in a fistful of organic blueberries and put a teaspoon teaspoon and a half of monk53:36fruit mix it up and you tell me if you know how's that taste like it's amazing53:41and when you actually look at the buying it by the quart and the basket and the bag versus buying it in a lot of these53:48convenience exactly so a lot of times like the the crap food is packaged in a53:54convenient way and so people are actually paying for the convenience exactly and getting the crappy food and54:01and I think that's a big narrative that needs to shift is the expense of54:08convenience of convenience i say this all the time convenience is killing us it really is and we think that it's so I54:15said this earlier it has been so hammered into us oh it's so expensive to eat healthy it's so expensive i am not I54:21I'm by no means saying that I think that um that some of this stuff is not overpriced and I know if you really54:27start getting into ins and outs of it it can get really expensive but if you are dire straits really on a budget forget54:33the organic okay that is concerning and I focus on it but like if you are dire straits and you were just trying to eat54:38more whole real foods just get ground beef rice beans a big court of yogurt um54:44normally eggs are well priced i think they're going back down right now they're back down now i think so right i heard they're like back like four or54:50five years ago prices okay i need to I've been traveling so I haven't gone to store recently54:56but you know focus on the basics like that and like you said get fruit and get yogurt and just focus on eating as many55:03whole real foods as you can and dump all the convenience because it's expensive over the last 20 years in human biology55:09one compound I've trusted again and again is NAD+ it's critical for energy55:15focus and cellular repair but your levels drop around age 30 i used to55:20administer NAD via IVs in my clinics but now I take Rorow Nutrition's liposomaal55:26NAD

let's get back to the Ultimate Human Podcast55:54you know I I I see too that there's a lot of free apps out there right now um there's like Seed Oil Scout um and I56:02Trash Panda what is it called trash Panda where you can scan everything so people can go and scan everything in the grocery store and it's called Trash56:08Panda that's actually kind of a cool name i know it's such a cute name i love it that's catchy trash Panda great job56:14and so you scan the QR code on any food label exactly and it'll tell you and then it'll tell you it rates it and then56:20they tell you all the ingredients that are red flag why they're red flags and then it'll it'll give you um alternative56:26options really yeah it's really cool that is amazing okay so I'm going to link these in my show notes like Seed Oil Scout um what is it trash Panda56:34trash Panda panda uh there's another one that will um and I'm gonna I'm gonna figure it out it's just not coming to me56:39right now that will tell you where um your local farmers markets are yes um and shockingly when I look at the number56:48of places where you can buy locally grown food nearly every56:54state in North Dakota you know I mean like colder climates um you know there's a lot of places that have farmers that57:01are that are growing foods and make it available to the public and there's there's apps that you can use to help you find that y um I use one here called57:08South West uh Ranches and raw dairy raw cheese you know their bees their their57:16honeys i mean and it's and it's just it's just amazing and I think that we could have a shift and I also believe57:23that awareness is key because through people like yourself myself and all of our peers if if it becomes politically57:33not cool to be siding with chemicals synthetics pharmaceuticals highly57:40processed foods which is poisoning our children that's a giant win and if the57:47consumer you know if their buying habits shift then there's no choice but for the57:53market to shift it drives the consumer trends actually during our Senate speech uh Jason Karp who's the founder of Hugh58:00Kitchen he actually said this and he has he he knows what it's like to be in58:05those boardrooms with those companies and he said that a company like for example Kellogg's General Mills if they58:11see just a 10% drop in their sales they scramble just 10% do you know how little that is billions of dollars but exactProfit-Driven Food Companies58:18but I mean from our perspective of like if we all of a sudden just decide like we're not going to buy from their products anymore and we're going to buy58:24from a smaller local farm or you know a smaller company that's actually doing right by us that doesn't take that many58:29people to see a huge shift like that and I mean look at organic organic has absolutely exploded in the last 10 years58:35and it's all driven by consumer trends we drive that with our money i think people don't understand how much power58:41we actually really have yeah and I think that now there's an opportunity because of social media which can be good or bad58:47but because of social media to kind of circumvent that system too to circumvent that media narrative because it it was58:53really interesting just as a crazy exercise during the Super Bowl um this year we sat with my family and we were58:59just taking note of all the commercials yes it was all junk food oh my gosh it's like the consumer does doesn't even59:06stand a chance if I like I know the OMIC jingle by heart now oh oh59:13and it's like the choir's back there like I heard it singing along and you59:19know and then you know the Doritos commercials are so uh so cool but you know what I find really encouraging you59:25know we just banned Red Eye number three um there are certain states like Texas um um there's a state recently I want to59:32say West Virginia just banned it virginia um huge just uh banned it and59:39so this means now if you're one of these major manufacturers or distributors and59:46you just cut off an entire state um they're going to be forced to make that change for everyone else we will start59:51you know um and do you think that this is profit driven because they've already made the changes overseas i think this59:57is another thing that the public doesn't really you know Food Babe does a great job at highlighting this um raising1:00:04awareness to the fact that it's not something that can't be done because it's something they're already doing1:00:09exactly it's just they're not doing it here and these American companies are making these for other countries that's1:00:15what drives me nuts about it that blew my mind i know um that you know when you1:00:20compare the labels of uh you know a again I won't use a brand name but a box1:00:25of certain cereal here and the same box identical box of cereal made by the same manufacturer in the UK or even in Canada1:00:33in some cases the dramatic shift in the ingredients and I got to think it's just got to be pennies per product but you1:00:39know what that is actually so Jason Karp again was talking about this at our Senate hearing and he was emailing back1:00:45and forth with one of these companies and the issue is is that they have realized that the brightly colored1:00:52cereals and you know brightly colored fruit snacks or whatever it is that they're adding those dyes into make them1:00:57more appealing and addictive to children and so that's why they do it so Trixs actually famously a couple years ago1:01:03they took they announced we're we're taking out all the artificial colors yeah and they're like we're going to use1:01:08natural dyes you know to color them well they're not as bright because the1:01:13they're colors made in nature it's why when you see cereal it's like fluorescent highlighter color it's not1:01:19colors that you fluorescent highlighter mauve and chartreuse you're like I don't see those in nature i do not see those1:01:25in nature yeah it's like highlighter colors um they actually saw a dramatic1:01:31drop in their sales because Trixs was the only one that was doing it and so they brought them back so this is a1:01:38large part of the issue is that these companies are digging their heels in because they're like \"No we're going to lose money off of the profit of these1:01:45cereals.\" And but I think also if there weren't alternatives well exactly if everyone was forced to then the kids1:01:51will just have to acclimate and honestly it will be so much better for them the reason why they've banned them in places like the UK and Sweden is because they1:01:57have recognized that these dyes cause hyperactivity in children talk to anyone who's an educator and who's been in the1:02:04space for the last 20 years i can't tell you how many teachers DM me almost on a day-to-day basis and they'll say \"I've1:02:10been working for you know 20 years as an educator and I have never seen so many behavioral issues ever in my life.\"1:02:15Really yeah and you hear this in in schools i mean and you and and again it's multiffactorial and and I don't1:02:22want to sound the alarm on any one thing causing everything but you know at some point these skyrocketing rates of autism1:02:29skyrocketing rates of childhood cancer the skyrocketing rates of obesity it's scary the number of children now that1:02:35have fatty liver disease almost 15% of our our teens and preubescent teens have have fatty liver disease i mean that1:02:41used to be reserved for alcoholics alcoholics um oh that condition largely didn't exist 50 years ago that one1:02:47really gets me it gets me too and the you know autism which again is multiffactorial but it's a1:02:52neuralinflammatory condition and we know that certain things are causing these neural inflammatory cascades and a lot1:02:59of autism distance on the spectrum is related to the grade of inflammation that they have um and and and the amount1:03:06of this neural damage and the the exciting thing is that a lot of this is1:03:13reversible um and I think you know people like myself that had a career in1:03:19mortality coming together with people like yourself that have a career in nutrition and and other people that have1:03:26careers in politics and medicine you know we're all starting to realize that1:03:31man we really need to to do something but the solution is very promising like1:03:38it's it's really exciting it's not a restriction of the freedom of choice um because that is one way that this1:03:44movement gets attacked i get attacked you get attacked yeah um is that you know we're just going to strip free1:03:50choice away from everybody which is not what we're not saying you can't have ice cream we're not saying you can't you1:03:56know do all of those things that you you know are going to decimate your health but but there's no reason why we should1:04:02consciously be allowing this stuff Yeah into in into the the food system so um1:04:09you know back to the average mom and dad um you know or you know baby biohacker1:04:15that's that's just getting going what would you say because I love that you posed this question to me on your1:04:20podcast you know what are what are two or three things that they could do tomorrow um not big shifts in theirSimple Hacks You Can Start Doing Tomorrow1:04:26budget that you think could dramatically change the trajectory of their health i would say first and1:04:32foremost do an audit of your pantry and just start paying attention and reading1:04:38ingredient labels if you can do that one shift and start slowly swapping out a1:04:43lot of your normal everyday food products that you're buying for ones that are made with real ingredients1:04:49you're going to be off to a great start so I have a really really simple hack for this when you're in the grocery1:04:55store and you're reading a label and you see all the ingredients in there you never want to just look at the front the1:05:00front is a billboard for the package they're just trying to sell it oh and they'll also often have the health claims on there which is exactly1:05:06something else that Max Luger talked about that I thought was it was also one of those just phenomenally obvious1:05:12things that I never really thought about before and he was like you realize that most health foods don't make health food1:05:17claims like there's not a claim on the avocado really healthy fatty acids you know maybe may lead to longevity and a1:05:24healthy heart but you you go to the seed oils and it's like heart healthy low and saturated fat polyunsaturated you know1:05:30it's like they try to um eight vitamins and um four nutrients fortified enriched1:05:36you know it's amazing well it's amazing how many non-health foods they they have1:05:43to make health claims you're right right on the front of the package so spin it around look at the ingredients yep and I1:05:48would say the more health claims they make on the front is usually a really red flag so you're you you'll learn1:05:54here's the thing the first couple times you do this you'll probably spend a couple of hours in the grocery store sorry but you get in a rhythm and then1:06:00you kind of understand and then you know what foods you like um and you kind of start to understand which ones are just1:06:06you tell it's a red flag you don't have to do it again exactly right so my rule is if you can read So read all those1:06:12ingredients if you could technically if you wanted to make this product at home I'm not saying you have to but let's say that you were like \"Okay if I wanted to1:06:18make these crackers at home could I buy every single one of those ingredients in the grocery store?\" I always use Simple Mills as an example simple Mills has1:06:25rosemary extract it's made with almonds um just all whole real foods you could1:06:30technically buy every single one of those ingredients in the grocery store and put it in your cart and make those crackers at home if you wanted to wow1:06:36whereas alternatively if you turn around something like CheezIts it has BHT in there it has some preservatives and some1:06:42other crap in there that you're reading that you're going I have no idea where I would find BHT in the grocery store where would I find that in the grocery1:06:48store it doesn't exist wow that's a great point so that would be something that I would say put that one back on1:06:54the shelf look around there's a lot of different alternatives now if you're looking for a cheese like cracker there's a couple of other brands now1:06:59that are creating ones that are just made with real food ingredients if you don't start doing something like that some of these other ones that is you're1:07:06already going to be off to a great start another one that I love to remind people real food tastes amazing1:07:13amazing it is so good especially if you you learn a couple things that you love1:07:19to make you can repeat those get you know follow some creators online that teach you how to make really simple1:07:24whole real food ingredient recipes also you don't have to give up your favorite foods we literally had burgers for lunch1:07:29yeah i eat burgers a couple times a week that's so awesome yeah we had And we had organ blend meats and we had the ground1:07:36beef with it and we had some shaved goat cheese on the top oh it was it was delicious right it was delicious it was1:07:41so good and this is what I remind people all the time you don't have to give up your favorite foods but make sure that1:07:47when you're eating those foods they're made with whole real food ingredients so if you can't find a restaurant nearby that's um you know using 100% Italian1:07:54flour or whatever it is in their pizza dough make pizza at home make those burgers at home or find a really good uh1:07:59burger place that has grass-fed burgers and you know beef tallow fries if you can find them um so that would be my1:08:06second one is you do not have to be restrictive in fact I have never had a1:08:12healthier relationship with my food ever in my entire life like I've never had a healthier relationship with it because1:08:17if as long as it's real food nothing is off the table for me i don't feel like I'm like \"Oh I can't have that cookie or1:08:22whatever.\" I'm like \"Is it made with real ingredients great i'm going to have the cookie.\" I love it yeah that's my only restriction is that I want it to be1:08:29made with real food right whereas before when I was eating like Slim Fast bars and stuff I was literally trying to like oh how many calories is in this and you1:08:36know like trying to track everything and I don't even think that way anymore yeah neither do I so I'd say that and then I1:08:41would say the last one is try to eat try to eat as many meals at home as you can1:08:47because when you eat out this is when you're going to start seeing the additives and the seed oils and everything else so try to eat as many1:08:53meals at home as possible i love it Courtney you're amazing you're definitely coming back on i hope um we1:08:59have so many friends in common and you know it's it's it's an absolute honor uh you know and a blessing to be on this1:09:05journey with you you know and giving the support to this Maha movement um I have a VIP community so they I let them know1:09:13who's coming on the podcast and so they're waiting for you and they they've got some questions for you so we're going to jump into my VIP here in a1:09:19minute and if you're interested in becoming a VIP just go over to the ultimatehum.com and that's the1:09:25ultimatehum.comvip and you can sign up to be a member of my VIP community i'll even send you a free box of h2 tabs um1:09:32if you sign up to be a VIP this is where we do uh live coaching we do challenges we have private podcasts um this is1:09:39where I really am pouring the best uh of what I'm doing in my research and in my travels around the world so uh Courtney1:09:47I end every podcast by asking every guest the same question and that is umFinal Question: What does it mean to you to be an “Ultimate Human?”1:09:53what does it mean to you to be an ultimate human i think oh man I have to think about this for a second how do I1:09:59want to answer this i think to be an ultimate human is to live um live with1:10:05your soul's purpose and also to um live in integrity and always strive1:10:12for the truth and to um be the best you can for yourself and for your others or for everyone in your life and everyone1:10:18that you love um one of the main reasons that I got into healthy eating in the first place is because I knew what it1:10:24felt like to feel really sick i think a lot of people largely walk through life not even knowing how sick they actually1:10:30are and how sick they actually feel because they have no comparison and I went from feeling really good in my home1:10:35then going out of the home and eating like crap all the time feeling really sick and then coming back and realizing1:10:41oh my gosh like this is what so many Americans go through every day and they feel this way and they don't even realize it so I think learning how to1:10:48nourish my body take care of my body um and just to feel better and then as a1:10:53result I'm more clearheaded i'm more in touch with my innate knowing um what's best for me and I can have better1:11:00discernment and yeah it just it helps me live a better more full life and and also I just I want to live a full life i1:11:07want to have fun i want to have fun i want to have fun with my friends i want to have energy i want to do all the things I want to do i have so many1:11:13things that I want to accomplish and I think being healthy and taking care of my body allows me to do all of that and1:11:19show up for others that's so amazing so for my audience that's not familiar with you where can they find you online and1:11:25where can they find out more about Real Food yeah so I'm at
