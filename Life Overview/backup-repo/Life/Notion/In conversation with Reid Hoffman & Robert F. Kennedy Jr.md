Knight himself yeah the Rainman David Sachs and we have a bestie guesty for  
Reid Hoffman joins the show, reminiscing on PayPal stories with Sacks  
you folks friend of my other pod this week in startups Reed Hoffman is here and uh you know him as a venture  
capitalist board member at Microsoft and you the co-founder or the founder of LinkedIn I don't know if you had a  
co-founder co-founder co-founder of LinkedIn now owned by Microsoft he's got his own podcast  
masters of scale and uh he he and David saxs work together at  
PayPal Reed give it welcome to the program and give us a little story what is your fondest memory or the most  
quirky memory David S and that all those weirdos I'm sorry not supposed to use  
the word weird anymore I get banned on all of those unique personalities at PayPal tell us about that moment in time  
and do you remember the first time you met David sex yeah I met um David uh  
because Peter had known him from Stanford and hired him in um and you  
know David uh very quickly because he you know uh has a has a strong learning  
curve as he plays these things kind of got the Instinct of what the game we were playing with PayPal was and it's  
part of the reason why why I think you know each of the execs have had you know kind of key contributions to making um  
you know kind of PayPal successful and and David's was this kind of like um  
maniacal focused on the kind of the the cycle of how the product worked on eBay  
um and like like there was just a whole bunch of stuff I learned from him it's part of how I track you know kind  
of you know people I respect is what do I learn from them and that was one of the things that I would say I learned  
from uh David at PayPal that's nice David tell us your first memory of  
meeting Reed Hoffman would you remember where you were do you remember the conversation and yeah yeah I think well  
we met through Peter you know and Reed I think Reed was on the board of was confinity back then and then joined  
full-time what were you like 28 27 29 no I mean let's see um this  
would have been 2000 I I guess it would have been 27 when I first joined PayPal 27 28 I guess  
something like that yeah 99 so whatever that was yeah in any event I mean I'll  
just to return the compliment you know PayPal had all these existential issues where you had these larger entities  
trying to kill us Visa Mastercard eBay who else oh the let goes on City Bank  
yeah and uh Reed was was kind of our Emissary who kept all these dogs at Bay  
and managed to I guess be friends with them I guess to some degree even though they wanted to kill us and re was kind  
of in charge of making sure that these existential issues didn't blow up on us and they didn't so we got pretty lucky  
there it's it's the Will Rogers line it's politics is the art of saying nice doggy while you hunt for a stick tell us  
like a moment read that is incredibly memorable to you from that PayPal era  
you know some existential moment or one of the more difficult or funny moment moments late night moments that would be  
indicative of that era and whatever was in the water that Drew all that talent to one  
place well part of it is that I mean this is you know among the things I was learning from from Peter was that Peter  
and Max uh recruited just a tremendous  
focus on on uh like intense learning curves so you know it was one of the  
things that Peter later was like okay I guess you have to interview for being on sports teams and so forth because this teamwork thing does matter but like high  
performers and it was kind of like a like and that was part of the reason why there was such intense um you know kind  
of uh Innovation and capability um you know probably the most stunning memory I  
had at at at PayPal is we you know we're all young we're all first time we're  
we're kind of doing a startup that matters you know kind of uh making this stuff happen and we do this merger with  
XTO and and you know like pre the merger closing um you know Elon is is saying oh  
I got this CEO Bill Harris he's the best ever that's part of the reason why you should give so much percentage to the company deck.com and the merger You Know  
da d d d da and then after um the merger literally the first meeting I had with  
Elon is Bill Harris is a complete disaster we need to fire him right away like like before we get to the  
first board meeting we need him fired and I'm like uh Elon you need to talk to Peter about  
this well I mean my he is decisive that's for sure all right well let's get  
into we want you know we're going to go a little bit mullet here fredberg we're going to start with business and uh then  
maybe we had a we had a fun meeting about that topic at a place in paloalto that no longer exists called Antonio's  
Nut House yes exactly yes the legendary Antonio's n house yeah and when Bill  
eventually did meet his demise um at PayPal it was called The Nut House  
coup he got whacked at The Nut House where on the pool tables in the back you whacked him or in the boots in the front  
well it he wasn't whacked he was whacked at a board meeting not at the nut house but certain plans were formulated at the  
the back of Antonio's Nut House it's Antonio's Nut House is um yeah the most  
unhygienic bar in the Bay Area and then that's that's a pretty low Benchmark  
let's just leave it at that we'll start with some business here talk a little Ai and then since two of our panelists have  
a passion we'll do the party political parties at the end everybody knows re  
was a co-founder of inflection Ai and as a general partner at Greylock and uh one  
of the founding investors also in open AI there's a good story there I'm sure  
and we just got results Reed uh from Nvidia results were good they beat across the board stock was down after  
State of AI: Nvidia, cluster buildouts, competition  
hours analysts said probably profit taking putting that aside we've never seen a  
chart like this in the history of uh business I would say data seter Revenue  
26.3 billion 87% of their revenue now you remember Nvidia started obviously with you know video games and and uh  
didn't have a major Data Center business that has exploded uh net income 16.6  
billion gross margin 75% and uh here's your chart on a total  
basis nvidia's Revenue scale up is basically unlike anything we've seen But  
if you look their C quarter over quarter Revenue over the past couple years things are starting to cool off  
significantly after that giant boom R what's your take on nvidia's just  
incredible run here is it sustainable will they have competitors and do you  
think this buildout this massive buildout we're seeing from startups to sovereigns you know to Microsoft which  
you're on the board of Google Apple Etc is this sustainable and is this going to keep going well I got asked that  
question unsurprisingly by many public market investors over the year yeah and I said basically told them and say Hey  
look it's sustainable for two years which for you guys means forever yeah eight full quarters yes  
exactly so that that's Infinity right in terms of time um you know uh Nvidia has  
a very sharp you know kind of lead on the importance of the the chips for the  
training clusters um you know they're they're effective on inference um but I  
do think that as you kind of scale the demand there'll be a lot of inference chips uh coming in um you know I think  
chamath here invested in one of those oh um and um I think there's going to be a bunch of those kind of coming in and and  
and the bulk of the demand will be on the inference side and then Nvidia will have this challenge of do I try to keep  
my prices and my margin or do I do what what we like competition do I have to  
respond to the competitive market and that I think will will play out you know start playing out probably in a year two  
at the latest and then kind of go so I think it's not sustain the the the pure  
heat is not sustainable um but I think it's you know nvidia's got a very strong position and and um you know I  
definitely I would recommend people not be short on Nvidia yeah today so yeah there's growth  
left competition is coming and this is probably not the type of stock you would want to short at this moment in time  
yeah uh freeberg what are your thoughts on this buildout uh as well as the software buildout that's occurring and  
when do you think we're going to see some competition come into the space I don't know if this competition and the  
buildout I think we talked about this in the past I don't know if you guys saw these quotes this week or recently on we  
don't think about this build out in terms of Roi Gavin Baker in conversation  
on invest like the is that the name of podcast y I think referen some been with  
the leaders of these regarding the buildout is so important because ultimately if you create this quote  
digital God the you know return is how many trillions so it doesn't matter how  
many tens of billions you're spending each quarter right now you have to get there you have to make sure you don't miss the boat I guess Reed a question  
for you you're on the board of Microsoft still right like yes indeed as Microsoft SAA publicly talked about how they  
rationalize the investing principles associated with building out AI  
infrastructure in the cloud is it Roi based like hey in the next two years we're going to make this much additional  
incremental operating profit ory we got to get this thing working right right to be more precise is the investment driven  
by Roi or does everyone just say this is so strategic we just have to win it and we'll throw all the resources we have to  
at this well so um what well one board members speaking for Microsoft is you  
know is forbidden so I'm not speaking for Microsoft just speaking for me right um two all all cloud computing platform  
companies how are yeah what's your s on how they're thinking it's just one of the principles in the Microsoft thing is the company speaks for itself board  
members don't don't don't speak for them um but you know I think SAA is like the  
best public market CEO of our uh Generation Um I think he is  
stunning um in kind of blending com combination of strategic Insight with also kind of being you know kind of  
return on Capital you know sensible risk-taking Etc and so the actual thing  
between your guys questions in terms of because I can comment on how SAA thinks with this stuff is he's both thinking  
about like it's a platform change and you have to be there for the platform change for productivity for cloud Etc  
and okay let's rationalize the capital to when are we expecting Revenue how do we get Revenue sooner to to have that as  
a good productive cycle how do we um you know be not trying to you know just uh  
spend like drunken Sailors which is easy to do right but but to to be targeting  
you know kind of business outcomes and it's part of the reason why you know like like like you know he's very  
focused on what are we doing with office what are we doing Cloud what are we doing with you know as opposed to like  
you you you rarely hear him talking about AGI or never digital Gods because  
it's kind of the question of I am I am focused on this in a business sense and I think that's that's kind of the way  
he's doing it but there is obviously a you know kind of a it's hard to predict the future when it's novel and unknown  
in platforms and it's part of the reason why you have all the hyperscalers now you know kind of fully engaged and  
intelligently engaged because you say well if even it's just a new platform by which you know kind of software  
everything with with with a computer unit in it whether it's a a phone or a  
speaker or a computer or anything else anything with a with a with a with a with a kind of a CPU or a GPU gets more  
intelligent like you can't miss out on that platform um and so that's that's I  
think the the thing that's motivating everybody but it's obviously you know how to do that smart is one of the things that uh you know everybody is I'd  
say obsessing about every week what do you think about the open source movement versus closed Source you  
were one of the original donators to open aai you were originally on the board and there's a couple of ways to go  
with this question but I just want to start with forget about the corporate structure over there we'll get to that in a second but I want to talk  
specifically about open source met is T met is obviously far behind open aai far  
behind Google Microsoft so they went open source when you're behind you go open source I guess is the idea here um  
but they're making some big progress who do you think is going to win this ultimately an open- Source uh provider  
of llms or proprietary closed Source like open AI is and it's confounding to  
say open AI is closed but closed AI yeah um look from the very founding  
open AI was never claiming it was going to be open source was claiming it was going to be one safety Open Access um  
and not differential or controlling access uh for that and I think that's they stayed true to that principle which  
is I think what the Genesis of the word open is there and um look I think the  
key thing is there's going to be winners all over the place I think there's going to be winners in the open source side um  
and you know I don't I don't know if llama's going to win from its open source thing as much as it's just TR saying hey we're training these models  
so we're going to you know uh put them out there because our closed system closed loop you know doesn't require  
selling for tokens and so forth but there's also you know Mr all and other folks who were doing competent models um  
and then I think that the uh the but you know there'll be wins in different ways  
so it's not like I think like for example you know I think there's going to be a bunch of different startups they're win whether it's coding agents  
or you know kind of very specific applications within medical or other kinds of things and I think they will  
you know generate big companies and I think large companies like you know the hyperscalers are going to are going to  
succeed as well now in the pure model competition the question is when do we start seeing a a a a Asm toote to scale  
and um and my guess is and you know kind of the gbt landmarks is each order of magnitude my guess guess is the soonest  
will be gpd6 um and it might not even it may even be after that and that's part of what the the bet that open Ai and  
anthropic and the hyperscalers are all making is that that that return to scale and then that has a lot of Downstream  
effects because even if you say we can train smaller models uh to do effective things part of what's going to be really  
instrumental for training those smaller models is the larger models so like even if there's a bunch of smaller models  
that are specifically capturing other kinds of Market opportun ities which is part of what I've been doing and investing in AI since you know 2014  
2015 um you know there's a there's a there's going to be a a set of those  
things that are all a whole bunch of startup opportunities so I think it's that the the a versus B is is is is a  
good dramatic framing um but it's really on which specific opportunities because there's going to be wins and  
opportunities across them uh sorry just real quick do you think there's one um llm or one found  
AAL model read that effectively does everything like a meta model that starts  
to take most of the market or does different versions of smaller models or  
small agents that kind of network together end up being the best solution for specific applications and verticals  
like how does this evolve over time like everyone's got this concept that there's a God model that does everything and wins and whoever gets the god model wins  
everything but the reality of software and principles of biology would indicate  
that you'll see like smaller Network things that are better at doing things than any one big thing and I'm to hear  
your point of view on the philosophy of that yeah I think the mistake that people make is they think precisely it's like the one model to rule them all it's  
like sauron's ring and actually in fact um already today like for example one of  
the things that happens with all the model providers at Microsoft and open eye which I've seen is all sometimes Sub  
in like GPD 3.5 as opposed to four to see what the answers are because there's a cost of compute even as you learn to  
bring the cost of the compu of the larger models down the larger models are always going to be a lot more expensive and by the way they're going to be more  
expensive kind of probably Loosely on the order of magnitude right so it's like well it's 10x larger it's 10x more  
expensive totally and and so when you're trying to say hey I'm trying to make business models work the language  
translation right if I just want to do language translation I don't need a massive model I just need a model that's really good at language translation  
exactly and so think you're going to see is is is networks of models and like kind of traffic control and escalation  
and all the rest and agents are not going to be one model they're going to be blends of models and that's one of the reasons why you say well there's  
actually in fact a lot of a lot of room for startups because it's not like we say well we we take gbd 7 and we just  
serve it for everything it's like well it's going to be super expensive and there's a whole bunch of things about like serving it more cheaply and like  
for example one of the the the really great technical papers that I love for Microsoft is you know all you need is textbooks it's like you can you can  
train very specific models on kind of like high quality data um along with by  
the way the larger model helping train it that all of a sudden you have a functional smaller model and you know  
the the question will be a blends of these things so I think the the the the multimodel model approach is I think  
going to be you know quickly Universal what is your take on I in this new era  
OpenAI's corporate structure and thoughts on Elon's lawsuit  
we uh see open Ai and you're not on the open AI board anymore right you're so you're dependent of that even though you  
made a big donation at some point donation and investment I led the the first commercial series first commercial  
so you're an investor in it and you donated to it but actually let's start there what's up with that corporate  
structure how do we make sense of that something's a nonprofit you donated to  
it and then you invested in it and everybody's making money and selling and secondary at 100 billion how does that  
work in the world so um so it's it's a 51 C3 is the governor thing that's what  
started and you know when you know kind of Elon and Sam were starting this and  
said look we need you know philanthropic support and we're we're trying to make sure that there's like open access to AI  
which is going to be an instrumental technology and we've got some great technologists who want to come do this we started as a as a you know kind of as  
a 501c3 for doing it that that that persists as far as I know till today  
then you know one of Sam Alman 's you know pieces of Genius was that he kind of said look we're going to need scale  
capital and I'm trying to go out to raise and Commercial round was 600 million I'm trying to raise 600 million  
philanthropy and is not working right so so I have this idea which is the 501c3  
which is doing this kind of research mission of you know AGI for Humanity is also producing commercial benefits and  
we can create initially an LP which has a a kind of a a a a a revenue right on  
the commercial things that investors can invest in and you know um you know Reed  
it be really helpful if you led this um because you know and I was like well but you don't have a go to market plan you  
don't have a product plan you don't have a business plan like yeah yeah but you  
know like we we need to show that we're actually serious with the business I said all right fine I will I will lead it for my Foundation um you know because  
even though none of these things we like to see as investors were there but I was like look okay I'll lead it as inv I'll  
manage it as an investment but I'll do as an investment for my Foundation um in order to do this and um and what you  
know you know kind of that was kind of as we were beginning to get in a you know like kind of we we hadn't seen  
anything they were still doing DOTA and and robot hands and bunch of those so it's like we're betting on the scale  
thesis of generating something magical and so we hadn't seen gbd3 yet um and of course once that started coming then it  
was like well we need a bunch more Capital let's do a strategic you know you know um you know connection and  
let's talk to all the hyperscalers and let's work out a deal by which one of them invest in us and and and then you  
know the the Microsoft openi deal came together with you know converting the lp  
into a subsidiary of the nonprofit you know kind of saying look um there's all kinds of benefits that both open Ai and  
Microsoft can get from a business deal um and so that's that's that that's what's led to you know the structure um  
you know that I was familiar with before the board do you what did you think of elon's first lawsuit and then he dropped  
it and then he refiled where where do you think he's coming from well  
um what what is the uh you know I'm not very charitable about those lawsuits um  
you know I would like to be because you know elon's one of the entrepreneurial Heroes of our time and generation but I  
think it's the I think it's you know frankly I think probably the most thing to say is sour grapes um because you  
know for example I know Sam offered him as much of the investment round as he wanted right like he could have done the  
whole thing he could have let it you know it was kind of like hey look we still love you we still and like and he  
was like no it's not a company that I control it's going to fail so I'm not interested in investing and I was like  
okay right and so now you're getting these lawsuits that are like you know um  
like I was misled it was like you were offered everything at every opportunity other than converting open AI into a  
company that you you completely owned and so um you know I think it's without  
without basis without Merit but why do you think he would have dropped it and then refiled where do you think that  
comes from is was is there new information do you think or I think it was a jurisdiction issue  
Jamal oh that makes sense I got fact that but Reed I mean Elon put in the first what $44 million and he doesn't  
have any shares yeah I by the way put in 10 million at the same time and I don't  
have any shares from those 10 million but do you think that he kind of got screwed because he doesn't have any shares I mean at the time he put in the  
44 million it was never going to be a for-profit now it's a for-profit a lot of people are profiting you know  
assuming the paper Mark ends up being realized so he doesn't own anything I  
mean if you the seed investor and put up 44 million and something and then everyone's making money and you don't  
have any shares forget about the legal technicalities wouldn't you have a feeling of being screwed well I look I can understand the  
emotion of that but like it's not like elon's short of money right and so if you go look I'd like to have shares like  
I did invest in the other thing I didn't get any shares for the 10 million that I put in and by the way it's not just  
legal technicalities it's actually really important that you're not doing private enrichment off philanthropic donations and so you know it's it's but  
isn't that what's happened um no from a Viewpoint of  
they're held separate right um and so you know and the 501c3 continues to to  
control the um you know kind of control the kind of the the the the mission and  
Destiny and so forth and so the question are its mission is still is still guiding things and you're essentially  
investing in that mission and you recorded you recruited people you know on that mission and so um you know I  
think that the you know um you know I think like I said sour  
grapes uh okay so let's get into some political stuff first I want to uh get  
the IP question then I want to talk about lenina con so how do you think about IP in this you know briefly in  
this new world open Ai and New York Times can't come to terms New York Times caught them red-handed cookie jar  
according to their lawsuit having indexed a ton of their content it's pretty crystal clear that their  
content's behind a pay wall and that's how they make money I also subscribe to chat GPT I give them 20 bucks a month  
maybe 30 bucks a month for every employee in my firm and and I get New York Times content from there all the  
time I will ask it what does the wire cutter think is the best choice in chat GPT I get that and then I get the answer  
and I don't need my New York Times subscription I don't visit the New York Times anymore um feels pretty clearcut  
to me but how do you think about IP should uh an llm be able to ingest  
whatever they please or should they be required to get permission in advance and pay a royalty to content creators  
Reed Hoffman huh well as a content creator too look I  
think I think that it tends to be a little bit of a look we do want content creators to  
benefit economically from the work it's part of the reason why we have copyright it's part of the reason why we have payrolls you know other kinds of things  
that I think are are very important and I think it's it's a complicated thing that needs to be sorted out now that being said I think we also want to say  
that we can train these models like you know like training is like reading and like reading things is you know like  
when something's available to be read and you've engage in the right economic thing for reading it I think that's a  
kind of a reasonable fair use thing now maybe we update the terms of service maybe we update you know copyright law  
or other things to say okay that now changes you know I think we don't want to forbid changes in the future you know  
um this is like one of the problems we get with it blocks Innovation when we do that it blocks Innovation and you know  
kind of Hollywood it blocks Innovation and music it blocks Innovation so you want to allow some new chain you know  
changing landscape and I think this is a changing landscape that arguably is reading so I think that like both of  
those things are true in terms of what do we what do we want to sort through I think that one of the reasons why this  
is kind of like you know over like when I give advice to you know various news organizations and so say look don't try  
to hold out for money on the training side of things because you know we're going to create synthetic data we're  
going to do all kinds of other things that are going to mean that no one's particular data is really going to  
matter what you should be is on freshness on brand on other things and we should work out ongoing sustaining  
economic Arrangements like that that would be my two cents you know suggestion for it and I do think we want  
to design an ecosystem that includes that and you know when I was involved in those Co conversations at open AI they  
they agreed with that Microsoft certainly agrees with that in terms of you know how do we make sure that economics are fairly apportioned and so  
forth for you know what we're doing for you know this phase of you know and ongoing but like you know there's a  
current Tech new technological wave that's coming and how do you do that so you know that's a messy answer but  
unfortunately it's a messy subject it it's pretty messy subject yeah before we move to politics I just wanted to  
Inflection AI's deal structure with Microsoft, Lina Khan's impact on the tech industry  
actually ask you about inflection so is it still running yeah and so what  
basically happened there was like some transfer payment from Microsoft and a couple of the people like and then it  
seems like whatever that deal was a little bit seems to have been copied by Google when they did this character AI  
thing so just trying to get a sense from you are these deals to structurally avoid FDC scrutiny in terms of the  
building blocks of it or how how did you think about it and what is the what is  
the pattern and the trend on these things well the thing I think this happened was you know very early days  
you had things like you know we're doing an agent and if Pi had launched before J gbt it'd probably be in a different  
circumstance but like chat gbt got the oh my God high is the inflection AI the  
inflation agent yeah and so so by the time that Pi we got the the the trend  
right and the and the interest of the market right but we got the timing you know too late happens with startups so  
it's like okay we need to Pivot we need to Pivot from a b Toc model to a B2B and we have a unique model but let's sell  
that to other people who already have audiences because we're not going to be able to easily grow our audience and then you know once we had that as a  
conversation there were employees are like well we want to do the direct agent thing and that's what we want to do and maybe we'll go somewhere in order to do  
that and we're like okay how do we fund this and how do we make that work and how do we make it work for investors and we said hey there's a deal structure  
that could work which is you know with a you know kind of outside party you can get paid enough in a non-exclusive IP  
license and an ability to selectively hire folks and then you can dividend some of that out to investors so  
investors you know get back a you know kind of a 1x um and then kind of a a an  
ongoing position so you know as investors it's great to have a kind of optionality on its B2B business  
um in order to play that out and this is a structure that works for everybody in this pivot to be to be and that's  
essentially the the the structure that we did I see great pivot chth into Lena  
Khan I think one of the things that is quite Paradox paradoxical about your  
relationship with David saak is you both agree on something in politics which is Lena Khan and her Concepts around future  
competition and maybe how she's running uh this issue for the United States is  
leading to basically a freeze on the market we're seeing weird deal structures like some of the ones we're  
talking about here that could have just been Acquisitions and I'm curious your  
thoughts on what she you know this sort of breakup of Google now we're seeing  
that emerge at the same time that they're facing the biggest existential crisis of their career which is language  
models competing with them and me I would say half of my Google Searchers have already moved to you know uh you  
know chat GPT like services so what's your take on Lena Khan's approach to m&a  
and what impact if it's continued and sustained will that have on Capital allocation because I I don't know what  
happened to the single and double m&a Market but it seems to be completely gone everything from Adobe and figma to  
other uh mergers that could be happening are essentially Frozen so what's your take  
so it was funny because I kind of made an off-the-cuff you know kind of remark about Lena Khan which turned into a  
whole news cycle I I saw you on CNN where they were like are you telling Kamala and Biden what they have to do  
and I'm like no because I don't believe in that kind of Corruption of of of Politics the only way she's gonna learn  
about it is either she asked me or she watched this television show um and um  
and so so she's done a good job on the price cartel she did a good job on the anti competes both of which I think are  
very very good for you know competitive markets the problem is I think she has a misunderstanding of these uh large tech  
companies and um for example on the m&a thing you know her theory is you got to  
prevent the aggregation of power so you got to you got to fight every acquisition of note and the problem of  
course is that actually quells venture capital investment because it's like okay um part of the the returns is if  
I'm going to invest in something that might be competing with you know one or  
more of the large tech companies I need to have acquisition exits as part of  
being able to to fund enough Capital to really make that acquisition you know that that that that investment possibly  
work because if it doesn't work I want to be able to at least return recover my Capital by an investment so the right  
way to look at it is is there competition amongst the top tech companies because you know if one of  
them is like squashing all the other ones that's a problem if we're if we're five large tech companies heading to  
three then I'm much more sympathetic to our point of view but we're actually five heading to 10 right or five to  
seven heading to 12 because like Nvidia is now in the mix and and others I think coming Mi is you now over 500 billion  
yeah so yes and so you have this ability so the thing is is they're competing on  
the Acquisitions just like they're competing in the Mar in the marketplace and if you're trying to quell the whole  
thing because your theory is like like they should just you know the startup should just be able to grow up to  
compete that actually means that those will never get the capital that they need in order to do that which means  
you're actually having the opposite of your intent right what you're doing is you're actually in fact making there be  
less competition because you know capitalists can't say if I'm going to put a 100 million 500 million a billion  
dollars into this company I at least have a chance of getting my Capital back or I can possibly create a competitor  
and that's that's the reason I was speaking out against it as an expert um was like interesting you I saw you I  
think it was a jake taper Tapper who uh you kind of grilled I thought you did an exceptional job of just saying listen I  
made a donation this is how I feel about it but obviously she's going to do what she wants to do and and that's just how  
politics works so uh I thought that was actually pretty well done and I actually appreciate you fighting for more m&a  
because it would be great for the industry Sak you wna you want to throw up a political topic here or you want me  
to no just just to stick on Lena Khan for a second so I I agree that her approach has been uh overly Broad and  
has had a chilling effect on m&a and so Jal like you said we've lost those base  
hit Acquisitions that I think are important to the Venture Capital Market that help new stars get funded I mean if  
the Returns on risk Capital go down there's going to be less of it that me'll be less be less inovation yeah so  
I agree with Reed on that the area where I'm not sure we agree is and and where I do agree with Lena Khan is I do think  
the big tech companies have too much power I do think that they are monopolies or have monopolies and I do  
think they need to be controlled I just think that you know I wouldn't prevent them from doing any m&a whatsoever I'm  
curious if Reed like agrees with that that the big tech companies have too much power or agrees with Lena Khan on  
that and I guess specifically do you think any big tech company should be broken up if so which ones I mean I I  
would actually entertain that idea of of of deong glomera or breaking up some of these big tech companies do you do you  
think do you agree that big Tech has too much power or not um I think it's  
TBD um but the reason I'd say look take the opposite point of view we would say no uh the thesis for no is that they are  
very strong American comp companies that get you know in the most cases over half the revenue from  
overseas they create uh technology platforms that beneficially differentiate the  
US um versus you know many other uh countries in kind of global circumstances like the inter and other  
kinds of things um I think that they are competing ferociously with each other I mean uh you know Jason just mentioned  
that you know it's kind of like look we've already got like chat GPT competing with Google search and other kinds of things and I think it's  
competitive pressure right this is I think what capitalism is about is competitive pressure that essentially  
creates the thing and that's the reason why like if it's if if we were shrinking like it was Google Uber Alis or I  
actually frankly think that the you know Everyone likes to talk about you know Google you like I think the the prime  
candidate is likely to be and I'm speaking as an individual and as a venture capitalist here is apple with  
the app store right okay so wait so so that brings up an interesting point one of the things we've talked about in this pod is that we shouldn't shut down m&a  
but the the uh FTC should limit anti-competitive tactics by these big  
tech companies yep Apple really good example because they drive everything  
through the App Store you're not allowed to do side loading they want to take what is it 30% piece of any sales you're  
not even allowed to have a link inside an application to drive except to the website yeah yeah Europe up now you can  
would you at least want to crack down on those anti-competitive tactics yeah no for sure and look especially when is you  
know we all know it's nonsense it's like look you could just give the consumers the option to to to allow side loading  
you could just say it's technically very simple to do and you could say look uh  
we we don't want you to Sid load because we view it to be Safety and Security but  
we're giving you the option right fine give people the option right Reed were  
you surprised that then the first Target where there was like some successful antitrust push back was against Google  
versus Apple and then second do you think that there's a chance like a meaningful chance that the government  
tries to break Google up or do you think it looks something maybe more similar to what happened to  
Microsoft so I think in mandating breakups you know like I think is a um  
look I think we should operate through competitive networks and competitive ecosystems I think it's part of what smart about capitalism and I think  
mandating breakups is only when essentially capitalism is failing uh on specific things you want to do the the  
least the least you can to get back to competitive networks in terms of how  
you're operating and so you know when you say hey look I iOS has this kind of Monopoly and you say there's no side  
loading you have to use app store you have to use the payment mechanism you know etc etc it's like well that quells a ton of startup Innovation we all know  
this as investors because we look at anyone who's perspectively doing a business like this and say no chance  
it's you know you're you're not going to succeed and so so then you say well what's the least thing that we can do  
right and you know a classic antitrust like well let's break off the App Store from Apple as well right unclear that  
that would really fully work you know that's like socialism mandating how the thing should work let's try to get it so  
that we allow competition uh to determine these things and like for example saying hey like you have to  
allow consumers the option of side loing you have to allow consumers the option of installing an alternative app store  
right like that kind of stuff I think you know what's the minimal stuff I think that's the kind of intervention we want to have because I think there's all  
kinds of benefits that come from why but why do you think that the the case against Apple has made less progress  
than the case against Google uh I think it's kind of it's less politically easy right like it's kind of  
like everybody loves their iOS phone and you know there's there's there's less of  
a blue and red you know kind of combo tackle um where you know the the blue Fe  
people are like hate big companies less offensive basically you're saying yeah yes more stylish they're they're  
prettier I I kind of like your approach though with the app store if you were to think of least harm to the ecosystem  
epic games has their own App Store for games they charge 88% they give they give I'm sorry they give developers 88%  
they only take 12 and forcing Apple to allow you know a startup to do an app  
store would solve the entire problem and it seems like that's where it's going to go and all five of us would invest  
instantly in an App Store that would say 0% take rate and all Advertising based  
what a great idea that would be yeah GRE I have a question a few weeks ago you said something to  
Reid's perspective on Kamala being hot swapped for Biden, funding groups that attempted to keep RFK Jr. off ballots  
the effect very publicly that you had had a one-h hour or multi-hour lunch with Biden and he just seemed like super  
on his game and then he was kind of dumped was that just a moment in time  
where he was really great with you or how do you reconcile that with Pelosi  
and all of these other folks and what happened to Biden well like most of us um I was  
pretty dismayed by the debate performance um because when I talk to  
him like detailed thoughtful analysis with no notes on Gaza questions about AI  
you know and what kinds of things you know what did I think about what the progress you know the thing they were doing with the volunteer commitments the  
executive order and you know what kinds of things should happen in the future and all that kind of stuff being on the game a little slower right than than you  
know a a 50-year-old would be but but you know like cogent and totally worth  
and then you kind of uh looked at the debate thing oh my gosh this is this is  
this is a disaster um and so um it was like look is the debate a one-off thing  
is it did you were you ill you know like trying to reconcile the two and you know spent a little bit of time trying to  
figure that out uh to to what was going on because it was it was the first time I'd seen something like that and you  
know um you know I don't you know I'm not enough of a DC Insider to know  
exactly what the set of conclusions were other than I you know I plotted you know Biden for having the kind of Integrity  
go look I'm maybe I'm Ill maybe I'm old maybe I'm slower but you know the it's about the country more than it's about  
me because I'm you know not um you know it's it's it's important to be about the country not about yourself I'll I'll  
step aside and ultimately his decision there's nothing that anyone could force Pelosi couldn't force it anyone else it's ultimately his decision he came to  
that decision so um you know do you think that they should have run an Open Primary after that and would  
kamla have won an Open Primary well it's hard to know I mean I think they were definitely leaning  
towards an Open Primary and then all the people who would be the most natural contenders all endorsed Kamala so um and  
by the way you say what kind of democratic process it was like well there was a democratic process that picked the Biden Harris ticket which turned into the Harris Walt's ticket and  
so that's not anti-democratic but I think if you look at the sequence of events it was kind of like well you know  
we're we're going to sort out you know what we're going to do and then you know all of the key folks you know Shapiro  
and and Whitmer and every else all endorsed K I was like okay let's just let's get back to you know kind of the  
the choice of two candidates and so I you know do you feel the voters felt  
Reed do you think the voters felt left out um the Democratic um  
voters well I mean from Posta seems not right with the level of kind of energy  
and all the rest it seems that that that um um that the uh that you know like the  
with the pure polling and kind of level energy and kind of what's going on they're happy with what they got yeah they're happy with what they got I would  
have liked to have that speedrun do you think it sets a bad precedent that there were these back  
room conversations obviously the staff of Whitmer Moore  
Shapiro their office speaks with Democratic party leadership speak with big donors and there was effectively a  
coalescing that took place over a period of time that said we should all stand behind and endorse one person instead of  
infighting and creating a split in the party and does that not set a bad precedent that there is a small group of  
people in either party that in a primary process effectively get to nominate their candidate get their candidate to  
become the nominee and therefore there's only two people for the country to choose from and as we have seen recently  
with RFK Jr and the lawsuits against him in being on the ballot in different states it makes it very difficult maybe  
for the people to have their choice and is that a bad way for democracy to work and I just love your philosophical view  
on this on like what's the best way for democracy in the United States to work  
so for the president for the president yes we do live in a republic all right and there there is various like you know  
some people have much more influence than others um whether it's media platforms whether whether it's um you  
know economics and ability to spend whether it's you know a history and a brand and and and other things and so  
you know this melee and and and kind of you know whole integration set of things  
now ultimately you know voters are going to decide in November right so you know people do have a you know and I think  
that that that staying to our Democratic process is what's really key like you  
know people going to the polls you know I think we should want to live in a country where everyone does you know everyone who is who is legally allowed  
to vote does vote um and I think that that's you know ultimately good thing now you know are there things that I  
would like to change sure I'd like to change I'd like to have rank Choice voting you know I'd like to have open  
primaries there there's a set of things like like actually my principal frustration in all of this stuff is you  
know what's what's one of the fundamental things the two parties agree on that that that that shouldn't be is  
that there should be only two parties right and I think that's uh I think that's something that you you need to  
fix and you can't fix it unfortunately I think with independent candidates because because the whole system is really set up uh for you know kind of  
two parties and independent candidates are almost always spoilers one way or the other I mean like on the RFK stuff I  
understand there was a bunch of Democrats who were trying to you know prevent him from getting on the ballot I actually prefer him on the ballot  
because I actually think his his his antiva stance you know really fit very  
well with with Trump and so I think he was do you want to address that Reed because I think there was a rumor that  
you were funding some of these lawsuits to keep him off the ballot or whatever like have you spent any money to try to  
impact RFK one way or the other I wouldn't be surprised if we look at all  
the money that goes to all the different organizations if organization X kind of had some kind of ballot thing my in my  
voice and instruction was always like no no no no don't do that that's anti-democratic but you know you can't  
control everything just like you invest in a company and Co sometimes the dumbass that you can't do anything  
about because you give you give money you give money to to folks that then execute their own strategies so you  
can't control on the ground tactics right yeah so there's there's that happens that you're like no don't do  
that right well okay that's a good um that's a good segue because let's talk about the five cases against Trump there  
are five lawsuits hold on jcal I don't can we just stay on this top for a second I think this okay so in in  
Michigan Wisconsin you had Democratic groups they fought RFK Jr's bid to get  
on the ballot okay they failed now he wants to get off the ballot but they won't take him off now that they think  
that his presence hurts Trump and at the same time Michigan's trying to remove  
Cornell West and Wisconsin's trying to remove Jill Stein so I'm curious do you think there's any principle on display  
here besides naked partisan hackery I mean basically the Democrats fought  
having third parties on the ballot when they thought it would hurt Biden and now  
they want to keep them on the ballot when they think it's going to hurt Trump except for those third party candidates  
who they still think will hurt Harris so what is there any principle here or is this just partisan hacker I I think it's  
you know I I frankly you know think that everyone who follows the legal process to get on the ballot should be on the  
ballot and you know we should follow the legal process I'm very much of a legal process kind of person what I'm opposed  
to is like you know calling raffensberger and asking for 11,000 votes right which is not legal right so  
so like yeah sure is that is that bad and and do I advocate against it the answer is absolutely yes um but it's you  
know follow the legal process if the secretary of state of Colorado throws Trump off the ballot for example is that  
legal process if it's then overruled by the Supreme Court or could we just say substantively that states shouldn't be  
removing candidates from the ballot that's anti-democratic uh well but you want  
them to remove RFK from the ballot no that's not what I saw I okay I'm just  
trying to figure out no the the rule is that well first of all I don't think that Democratic groups should be suing  
RFK to keep him off the ballot and that's what he said is that Democratic groups were suing to keep him off the  
ballot and they were trying to exhaust his resources so he couldn't mount an effective campaign and some of those  
groups you funded right so maybe you didn't know what they were doing but in any event I consider that to be  
anti-democratic RFK is now trying to remove his name from the ballot I think as a candidate you're allowed to do that  
and those same groups that once fought to keep him off the ballot are trying to keep his name on the ballot because now  
they perceive yeah because now they perceive the political calculation to be a little different so my so I don't see  
any of this as being Democratic this to me is just partisan hackery isn't it so can't youe that look yes fundamentally  
from a Viewpoint of like like for example my my direct actions and yes there was you fund a whole bunch of  
different groups and you have different groups doing different things but you funded them to do this thing that you were thinking of and things happen it's  
just like companies you know my thing was actually in fact making people aware  
of of rfk's antix you know statement his anti-science stuff because I thought  
that would be relevant in the polls in November that that was the the actual strategy that that I believe and I think  
that would differ entially you know hit Trump more and so therefore would be a  
spoiler right as these independ are I I have no problem with drawing attention to issues but I I do think fundamentally  
it's anti-democratic to sue third party candidates to the point where they can't be on the ballot okay let me ask you  
directly Cornell West um there's an effort right now to remove Cornell West  
from the ballot in Michigan do you support that or would you oppose that I mean is that democracy but by default I  
would oppose it I don't know any of the details okay fair enough Reed I have a I have a question for  
you it's more of a statement actually maybe I just left to get your reaction one of the most divisive issues  
Reid's thoughts on growing antisemitism  
that we have right now is people's position on October 7th Israel  
Palestine there is a sense that there's a growing kind of like virent strain of  
anti-Semitism in America a lot of people point to the extreme left as as where  
that's really gestating there was thoughts that Josh airo would have been an exceptional  
candidate but one of the large reasons why he was not really meaningfully considered was his religion I just want  
you to comment on the broad issue and whether you see it in the Democratic party whether you see it in the Republican Party whether you see it at  
all just give us a sense of where we stand culturally on this issue well so like I know Josh airo I  
think he's great um you know I've had I've broken bread with him um and you  
know he was meaningfully considered um you know I think that the um you know I  
think we should be so lucky that he would you know run for presidency someday uh some year um you know I  
actually didn't know Waltz at all and and and you know was initially kind of  
surprised because you know I was like Oh I thought I was probably going to be Shapiro and I was like well you know I  
think it was you know probably a close call down to those two and and it looks like you know you know in making  
decisions I think uh you know Harris you know made a good decision with Waltz so  
you know I think it's a um you know now on the on the anti-Semitism topic I do  
worry that you know broadly um we're seeing you know kind of more rise of  
anti-Semitism and that's extremely important to fight um you know because I  
think and I think there are people in in the you know it's it's a weirdly like like uh there's some lefties who are  
doing it and there's some righties who are doing it's both a blue and a red issue in different different shape and I  
think it's very important that we you know we stand against that uh as a country and so um you know I've been uh  
you know kind of mostly just trying to say hey look we gota we got to be anti anti-racism anti-Semitism and also  
anti-genocide and we got to figure that out what do you think of kamala's uh handling of that issue in her speech she  
basically seemed to I don't know say both sides it but she said hey you can  
uh believe that the people of Gaza should be treated more humanely and that uh you know Israel has a right to defend  
herself what do you think of her handling I think that's rational right like you should be anti- genocide both  
of Palestinians and of Jews right and and like like it's obviously a very very  
thorny topic yes right so um so I think you know saying that I'm going to try to  
protect civilians both sides anti genocide I think that's a human Caring  
Place to be looking out for people Reed do you think that generally speaking Marxist socialist principles are taking  
Thoughts on Kamala's economic proposals: price caps, wealth tax, etc.  
a firmer hold on the the the Democratic party and kind of those principles are  
starting to Showcase not just in the cultural phenomena that that chamath is referencing but also in some of the  
policymaking that's going on and um concepts of  
equity rooted in concepts of social justice ultimately rooted in Marxist  
principles emerging from the Industrial Revolution what about price fix so so as an example the price gouging you know  
price caps on food proposal the concept of a wealth tax not  
necessarily the unrealized capital gains tax but separately a tax on wealth all of these concepts of the degradation of  
power structure through policy and in part some have argued that the  
anti-Semitism arises from these principles and that the Jews are considered a privileged and Powerful uh  
cultural class is that is that not being observed you not do you not think that there's some tendencies that are  
emerging in the Democratic party and may be influenced by a louder far-left and that far-left is becoming more loud and  
and better represented in the party look I think we should speak out against both  
the far left and the far right um I think it's important to do both and so you know since you know uh I'm I'm I I'm  
playing the Democrat here on this conversation I'll ask you guys to play the the the or especially Sachs play the  
Republican and and speak out against the the far right too um but the the the  
short answer is yes there are amongst the extreme left that's not everybody in the Democratic party but the extreme  
left there is um some like you know misunderstandings about you know why  
it's important to to defend you know kind of anti- genocides like from the river to the Seas like yeah that's a  
genocidal statement don't use that one right that understand what language you're  
using and and to be like look the you know we've had a great genocidal moment with you know World War II and we're  
still trying to recover from it um two you know questions around like like what I think is a a a a foolish wealth tax  
even though it's by the way narrow to like 80% and then on like the the price gouging stuff um you know one of the  
things as I started scratching at it you know was interesting I think this week Kroger said yes we did actually artificial raise prices to profit from  
the pandemic you know and yeah you should stop price gouging it's not quite the same thing as price capping and  
apparently there's laws that affect even in Florida right or in Texas uh where  
some of you know uh you guys are living so like it's kind of um you know it's  
like okay I need to understand this issue in more depth but I don't think it's as simplistic as the political  
headlines are having it well but the reason why Comm Harris proposed the price fixing proposal price G whatever  
you want to call it was in response to inflation in other words we've had 20% erosion and purchasing power over the  
last four years Harris needs a response to that so she came forward with this new economic proposal so it's in that  
context this came up this wasn't some proposal by the far left of the party unless you consider K Harris to be far  
left I actually do but okay fair enough but my point is just this is her proposal and it's in response to  
inflation I mean you don't you understand what causes inflation right it's like the government printing too  
much money it's not it's not greedy corporations raising their prices too much I mean do you agree with that look  
I agree that you have to have good monetary policy and so I think we we probably agree on that and I think some  
printing of money is part of the normal functioning economy but too much is is bad and I don't think look I think Price  
look part of the reason why we just talked about antitrust stuff earlier you do have to look at places where there's  
a there's a possibility of kind of commanding stuff from your you're a privileged position and like  
you know the like I want we all agree we all agree that monopolies have to be controlled no no no debate there but  
that's not what's caused the inflation right because we've had inflation of Commodities not just Monopoly products but Commodities like just food Staples  
eggs you know chicken stuff like that driven driven by Fuel and labor and all  
the other inflationary you know underpinnings of those markets and I think we tried to highlight that I don't  
know if you saw Elizabeth Warren's interview on CNBC where she got taken apart she made some claims about profiteering  
by Craft Hind and the CNBC anchor has pointed out you actually incorrect craft hin has seen a reduction in profit over  
this period of time and so like there were factual inaccuracies in these belief systems but you know for me it  
feels a lot like the government setting prices in free markets is one of those steps towards socialist principles that  
worry me the most yeah and look I generally speaking as I was saying earlier I'm like like make sure the  
network sets sorts it out versus you know centralized control totally totally  
so so it's kind of like you have to look at is there a place where you're like going okay that's the reason I like focused her words were price gouging and  
if you're focused on the kind of gouging side of it is like there might be a marketting efficiency that you're essentially correcting then that's I  
think the same kind of thing we were talking about with like the FTC and the Apple App Store and so forth if it's  
like I'm just going to set a fixed price on eggs right that's a bad idea and by  
the way there's there bad ideas like the wealth tax thing that I that I disagree with her her economic thing also had  
housing which I think is a you know a good you know kind of thing to kind of lower cost for Americans and you know  
kind of make that kind of uh stable work like I think she's she's been good on  
immigration um I think this the The Langford Cinema bill which was from you know the the the Republican side was  
something they were fully prepared to endorse and you know Trump killed it because he wanted to campaign on it it's  
like look we care about the actual running in the country and so you look I think there's a bunch of good things but  
if you said do I defend price capping the answer is not as an independent principle by itself and by the way are  
there people lefties like you know a lot of what Elizabeth Warren says about capitalism I disagree with right I mean  
I could disagree with you on the border I think you know kamla Harris used to be considered the borders are that's gotten scrubbed I don't think she's done a  
great job on that but whatever that I want to go back to issues that affect Silicon Valley 25% unrealized gains tax  
uh it seems like most of Silicon Valley almost all of it is either disagrees with this or is up in arms about this I  
think jcal you would you said that this is disqualify line in the S it's disqualifying for me for sure yeah so  
absolutely I mean do you agree that a large unrealized gains tax 25% would be  
a disaster for Silicon Valley and the whole startup ecosystem or I mean how do you come down on that well as I  
understand it uh on that tax as it's proposed is you have to have um 80% % of  
your net worth that's right liquid yeah if 80% or more is illiquid then no you get to defer the  
tax but there's a penalty yeah you get to defer the tax there's a penalty that's right look I think it's definitely a quelling impact and it's  
definitely stupid and definitely shouldn't happen okay you know so we get your I think we got your position on it  
it's stupid yeah we all that but then but then why isn't it dis why isn't it  
disqualifying the way that jcal says are we just supposed to hope that Comm doesn't do what she is saying she going  
to do I'll tell you why I think that both the Republicans and the Democrats have realized that there's actually very  
little difference on a lot of the major things that they actually talk about so  
what they're both being forced to do is realize that because the centrality of a  
bunch of the things they say are the same they each have to go to their flanks to get the N plus one vote and so  
comma goes to the left and spouts all this stuff that seems Marxist or  
socialist or communist because she has to get those people to vote for her  
ultimately I think what ends up happening is most of the stuff in the middle has a decent chance of happening  
the stuff at the fringes I think they get put up Sachs almost as like a sacrificial lamb a good example I think  
is like all of the stuff that's happening with the student loan reform a half a trillion dollar plan it gets shot  
down by the Supreme Court this new plan another hundred billion dollar not even being heard yet by the Supreme Court so  
I think they know this I mean it's not like the Biden Administration is dumb the Trump Administration is not dumb  
either so I think what they're doing 10 million people would be an example on the right and taking away a woman's right to choose would be the other one  
yeah and by the way Trump has said you keep bringing that up but Trump has said that he would veto he would not support  
a national B oh no I'm talking about already doing he already he already overturned Rie wi I'm talking about that  
yeah and by the way issue to the states it's not outlawing abortion and by the way at the state people in  
Austin Texas well but that's not had a ballot initiative they  
have not had a ballot initiative there just about everywhere there's been a ballot initiative the pro-choice forces have won and besides that's a state  
issue now jcal not federal yeah no it's a state issue and Trump succeeded in taking away a woman's right to choose in Texas but one thing by the way look in  
How Silicon Valley views both candidates, why Reid funded legal action against Trump  
the spirit of the all-in podcast I wanted to be clear about like there's there's there's stuff on the on the Dem  
and some of their economic policy for the far-left people that you know kind of you know they're advocating for that I'm opposed to you know Saks I'd love to  
hear from you what parts of Trump's things you're opposed to here we go well  
look I mean I have been consistent on this pod for years that I thought that the let's call it the like extreme  
pro-life side was not good for the Republican party and I've been opposed to it um I don't think it's what J Cal  
says I think that overturning roie way did not abortion it basically returned the issue to the states and if you look  
at the referenda that have happened they've pretty much all gone the pro-choice Direction so I think that the  
overturning of Ro weight has actually allowed the country to sort of sort out that issue although it's not completely  
sorted out but look I would not support a National Abortion I would not support  
redering the issue I think there's a lot of issues on about you know War and Peace where I do  
not support the you could say the establishment con strand within the party I do not support all these  
interventions I do not support these forever Wars and there is a big debate in the party about that now one of the  
reasons why at the end of the day I support Trump is I know this will strike  
some people as counterintuitive but I think he is the moderate within the  
Republican Party he's a moderate on abortion I know Jak C you're still bitter about that Supreme Court case  
however he's been very very clear that he will not support National Abortion ban moreover he took the abortion  
language out of the Republican platform I think he's the moderate on um on  
issues of of War he's he was the first Republican candidate to run opposing  
Bush's forever Wars so I give him credit on those things on style he may not come  
across as a moderate but those are style points I think on issues he is the moderate the the issue I have with KLA  
Harris is I don't think she's a moderate you know so like just to take this 25%  
unrealized gains tax first when this issue came up we were assured well she doesn't really believe that even though  
it was in the Democratic platform and it was in the Biden Harris budget then people said well maybe it's part of her  
platform but it's not a priority for her and we just had one of her like top economic advisers come out on I think it  
was CNBC defending it and her campaign confirmed that she supports it okay so  
now the argument has become well she support it it is really part of the platform she would do it if she could  
but she's not going to be able to do it I just don't think that's a ringing endorsement of a of a candidate I don't  
think you want to support a candidate because they're not going to be able to do what they really want to do do you  
think she's a moderate or do you think she's a socialist you know uh gonna take the country very far left  
way yeah but what saaks didn't address is Trump's tariff policy which is also inflationary almost equivalent to the  
price gouging uh you know food price C I think that they're both inflationary and they're both bad policy that's my  
personal Point View where I thought it was going to go but anyway yeah honestly  
I'm not I'm not sure what I what I think of that proposal um you know I guess it depends on the details I'm not endorsing  
I'm not opposing it but but but just just back to this point that should we support KLA Harris even though we oppose  
all the policies that her campaign says she supports because it seems like that's the argument now is that Silicon Valley  
is expected to support Harris even though she wants and her campaign is confirmed she wants a 44% capital gains  
tax she wants a 25% unrealized gains tax these are things that I think the vast  
majority of silk Valley considers to be disastrous for the startup ecosystem should we support her in spite of those  
things well and why look the information did a an actual data poll as opposed to  
us being talking head saying we say that Silicon Valley does X or Y and you know the information poll showed that There  
Was You Know Much broader support for the Democratic ticket than the Republican ticket is that is that the  
thing that Ron Conway just tweeted he might have I don't know if he just no that's that's  
different AET that's that's a that's a different group that's a group to counteract you and chamath uh throwing  
as fundraiser for Trump was like I think where that came from so so but the  
information a news source that that that ran a poll you know did it objectively ran the whole thing to to try to answer  
the question came out with more folks in favor of you know the Biden Harris  
ticket than I believe why do you think that is I think that is well because because look taxes is an important issue  
and I think if you ask any any silon Valley business person they say look lower capital gains promote long-term  
investment ask me that's what I would say too but you know you kind of go well what actually in fact you most need for  
business is stability uh rule of law not grifter capitalism where it's like you  
know give me a ability to my own nft uh you know etc etc you know that's what  
they go we want that and by the way we can navigate a higher tax rate it'll be  
less fast on growth and everything else but we can still invest create businesses you know etc etc but we can't  
do it with you know kind of a uh corroding the rule of law right like you  
know I think both uh David both you and chamath spoke out against the January 6 stuff I'm curious where you're on that  
now it's still top of mind for me that's the reason why the kind of the rule of law thing is my red line not a tax  
policy well let me ask you about that formally here there are five cases against Trump you have uh the  
Insurrection case you have the New York taxes case you have the hush money case you have the EG and Carol Case uh and um  
one am I missing there oh and the uh documents case you funded like Peter Teel funded The Gawker case uh the EG  
Carol Case uh which Trump lost and uh just to ask you why did you choose to  
fund that and do you believe Trump sexually assaulted Eugene Carol well it's kind of not relevant  
whether or not I did or not what I funded was an ability to have you know kind of a woman who doesn't have power  
who's being threatened by a rich man with a lot of money and power to try to silence her to have her day in court  
where 12 everyday Americans right can come to a judgment and their judgment  
was uh that there was an assault and there was slander about the assault um  
and they did it twice and so that was the reason I funded it and you know I think that that's important we you know  
the laws apply more importantly to Rich and powerful people than it does to poor  
people um that's that's the important about the the thing I love about America is a rule of law system and I think  
that's what's most important and that's what's really fundamental that's my red line relative to kind of lines and the s  
that we're talking about um and you know that's uh you know that's the reason why  
the various kind of lawsuits where that seem to be that that's what's being emphasized then you know I'm I'm I'm  
happy to support them well you I don't see how it's rule of law when you have a uh district attorney  
Alvin brag who's elected on a promise to get Trump he then takes what are at most  
uh a a bookkeeping misdemeanor that's past the statute of limitations that's expired and he turns into 34 felony  
charges on a legal Theory that was never explained to the jury and then basically  
Trump is convicted in a sham trial by a  
hyperarcs can then run what do you think of that on The Branding on The Branding that he's a quote convicted felon so  
there are there are four other trials we got your first one think rule of law hold on I don't think feedback I don't  
want to get re feedback too but mean finish my point I don't think it's rule of law when Trump is prosecuted on a  
documents charge Biden himself is guilty of he's got all these documents in his garage for decades which the the judge  
has thrown out and we've seen a bunch of these lawfare cases where Trump has ultimately prevailed the judge has thr  
it out or he's went on appeal so I don't that seems to me like abuse of the legal system for a partisan political goal not  
rule of law okay so Reed there's four other cases two of them Trump's been convicted in two of them are outstanding  
what's your take on the four cases you've heard Sax's take so what's the two that he's been convicted J Cal  
what's the other one besides the Alvin there's three there Alvin brag was convicted uh and then the um Trump  
organization with the CFO uh committing tax fraud he was convicted in that one as well or the Trump organization was  
convicted and people say that's law fair by Laticia James so guilty guilty guilty and those three of five so what's your  
take on the four that we haven't discussed you had and heard your opinion on Huffman so look I think it's you know  
it's definitely possible to have some versions of laware although I think most people use the term when it's the legal  
process and law enforcement that they don't like um you know I think that in the brag case you had you know uh you  
know indictment and 12 jurors there's jurors I think as I recall one of the jurors said he got uh that juror got  
their principal news from TR truth social it was a unanimous conviction um I think that you know you you have Vice  
president uh Pence you know comes out and says you know Trump asked me to  
overturn the election illegally right that's your own vice president so I don't think that that kind of suggests  
that there's this just rampant political persecution that there's a lot of fire where there's all this smoke doesn't  
mean that every single thing uh you know kind of Democrats are trying to put Trump in jail for 700 years these cases  
are still outstanding they want to put him in jail Reed do you think Trump should go to jail uh I think if he broke  
laws that say he should go to jail I think the laws apply to powerful people as much as they apply to Everyday People  
right so I think that's why were these cases why did they wait for two years on these cases so they could bring them in  
an election year actually I don't think if you look at the like look speaking factually Trump's lawyers are always  
trying to delay the stuff right I think they were trying to follow every legal process and Trump's lawyers keep asking for want to campaign this year instead  
of being stuck in a courtroom look after January 6 this was this was last year and the year before asking for deferral  
setting out trial times like all of the stuff was from his side trying to delay  
it if it got delayed into this year that's a bad judgment on his his part  
Jack Smith just filed new charges new charges and all this stems from January 6 in the wake of January 6 mayor  
Garland's justice department did an analysis of whether Trump could be prosecuted for incitement whether he  
incited that mob and the legal memo came back and they said no we don't have a case here it does not meet the legal bar  
for incitement then it was reported by the New York Times that Biden thought that mer Garland was basically being a  
wimp and they need to go after Trump so the hyper partisan da or prosecutor Jack  
Smith was hired and he came up with a novel legal theory that somehow Trump had perpetrated a fraud on the American  
people never been seen before and since then he's been Prosecuting Trump and seeking to put him in prison and and  
when the Supreme Court just kicked the legs out from under his case with a recent decision he just refiled charges  
I don't understand anyone can look at this and say yeah look what happened on January 6 wasn't great but the doj looked at it it wasn't Criminal but yet  
they've been pursuing this guy seeking to put him away for the rest of his life seeking to interfere with this election  
seeking to deprive the American people of a choice on a separate track you've got Democrats in States like Colorado  
literally removing Trump from the ballot okay Reed your thoughts so look the first thing is um  
January 6th I think is a red line I think it's he did incite a riot whether  
or not the legal for it let's let re finish yeah you know I was fair enough  
go ahead sorry right um so I think it was the you know there was an incitement  
of a riot um I think the the riers went in and you know killed police officers  
were looking to kill vice president Pence you know from the court testimony courts are the best proxy that we have  
for finding truth and stuff it's one of the reasons why you know by the way and when for example the Supreme Court says  
no that's great that's legal process I just have to fact check that no police officers were killed where are you  
getting that from uh I think there were there was the one died from his injuries  
and you know very soon after and then no no no there there was one cop who had a seizure later it wasn't part of the the  
riot no police officers were killed as a part of the riot I just have to fact check that it's just not true well and  
then there's the the one who committed suicide too which is a question of you know I don't know how you that yeah so  
so anyway so you got the you know the the the storming of the capital um you  
know he says these people are uh American Heroes he's going to Pardon them he's going to hire them into his  
administration right and if that's not encouragement for other people doing similar things you know wa he's hire  
January 6 riers he's gonna hire them yeah I hav heard that well we we'll we'll get you the the the the the Trump  
speech there's all kinds of wonderful things in Trump speeches if if you listen let me let me just move to one  
thing so Reed I think this has been an amazingly robust conversation and I think you as  
always as long as I've known you now for 20 years have been really intellectually honest I want to ask you a favor which  
is can you stay for 10 extra minutes and talk with us to Bobby Kennedy and the reason I want you to do that is I think  
that there is a bunch of misinformation I asked you about these things I think it's important to hear maybe from Bobby  
and just for him to know what you because I do think it's important to hear from the horse's mouth can you just give us like 5 10 minutes so that we can  
do that because I think it would be an important thing to do so when is that no just right now just we're gonna yeah  
we're rolling into an interview with last it's just last minute RFK Jr  
who's on vacation said that he would talk to us about what it was like to kind of withdraw and all this sort of  
stuff and it got so we booked it right after you but he's in the waiting room I'm fine to do it I mean it's totally  
your choice it's one of the things I like about your your all-in podcast is  
you know kind of like let's let's try to speak truth okay right so hey uh Bobby Kennedy is here Mr Kennedy it's great to  
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. joins the show and recaps his campaign and decision to back Trump  
have you on the all-in podcast for a second time uh may I introduce you to uh Reed Hoffman who you may know of but I  
don't think you two have ever met we have not pleasure to meet you likewise  
pleasure Mr Kennedy you dropped out of the race uh perhaps you could tell us and I was quite disappointed about it I  
really wanted to see a third party candidate getting into double digits again and I just want to commend you on  
the effort that you put into it maybe you could tell the audience why you as a  
reported never Trumper joined the Trump team and dropped out so Jason I you know  
I'm not actually I haven't actually terminated my campaign I suspended it um we've taken  
ourselves or we're trying to take ourselves off the ballot in the in about 11 states so we'll remain on the ballot  
in 39 States um and the all red all blue States will be on the ballot in the  
states where we felt we were going to hurt president Trump with a polling show  
that we're we're uh getting off there mainly the Battleground stat ironically  
now the same people whove been trying to get me off the ballot for a year or  
since October are now fighting to keep me on the ballot in those States so that's one of  
the S of ironies um I you know it became  
clear when about two months ago when the  
um when it it became clear that I was not going to be allowed on the debating stage and I I pretty much had a shut out  
in the mainstream media so the mainstream media uh ABC NBC CBS CNN  
MSNBC in 16 or 17 months I had only two  
live interviews um Ross perau during his 10-month campaign had 34  
interviews and then you know all of them were very very much aligned with the  
Democratic National Committee and so when they did mention my name which was pretty and it was  
accompanied by a lot of defamations and pejoratives and um mischaracterizations  
Etc I never really had a chance to reach those audiences the audiences that I was  
reaching I was dominating in I was beating all the candidates among Independents which is now the largest  
demographic I was beating them among young people so your audience was  
supporting me um the audience that were listening to long form interviews I was  
dominating but in the older audiences which is a critical Baby Boomers people who really should have been for me  
because they are people who from my generation who remember the Kennedy  
administration they were part of Camelot they also I was uh very very  
popular with them for many years when I was the environmental Champion  
alone and I should have had good inroads but I was never able to communicate with  
them because they watch they get their news from from the mainstream media and  
if you're living in that information ecosystem you're going to have a very very low opinion of me I mean if I was  
getting my information from those networks I wouldn't vote for myself and uh and then uh president  
Trump you know reached out to me through this guy call meanss who a food Advocate  
say food Advocate 3 hours after the shoot after  
the shooting at Butler I got a call from him and he asked me if I was still  
interested in the specifically in the VP um uh slot  
and I said no which I would not have taken vice president  
uh slot and um he said would I talk to be  
willing to talk to the administration um to president Trump rather and at first I said  
no and and I talked with some of my family members and uh including my kids and I  
then sent CI means and not saying you know I'm interested in talking and and  
and I got a call almost immediately from president Trump I spent about I don't  
know 30 minutes on the phone with him and we met the next day in um in  
Minneapolis and then we met again more recently we had continuing talks with  
them and we met again more recently for a very very intensive and long meeting  
at marlago with some of his family members and during those meetings during the first meeting  
we talked about the idea of having a Unity ticket where I would remain on the ballot where we would Ally  
ourselves on certain critical issues but we would be able to continue  
to criticize each other on the issues and that we didn't add a line on and  
president Trump was very happy with that Arrangement um and the issues the  
critical issues on which we agreed and I was really stunting to see the level of his  
commitment to those issues was one anding there are the three issues that really got me into the presidential  
campaign one was uh ending the war in Ukraine uh the second issue was ending  
the censorship and the third issue and most important to me was addressing the  
childhood chronic disease epidemic and the you know the these connected issues  
about soil health and the corruption in our Regulatory Agencies by usdaa and FDA  
NIH CDC and HHS which have become sock puppets for these for the big  
pharmaceutical big EG big food processing industries that they're supposed to be  
regulating um he was very very much aligned on those issues and it gave us  
essentially a beach head um in which to construct you know this uh an alliance  
Bobby let me ask you a question I just want to go back a little bit because I I just want to make sure I heard it properly when Cali called  
you was it to be the VP on the Trump ticket and did you was that asked and  
did you consider it and why did you say no to that but then said yes to this  
well I had no interest in being a vice president if you're vice president it's  
a you know I've grew up in politics and vice president is a worst job in Washington you have no budget you have  
no staff except what that your budget actually all comes through the White House so if the Pres if you do something  
that uh offends the president he can literally you know he can take away your plane he can take away your staff and he  
can the only thing you really have is the Naval Observatory which is the official presidence to the vice  
president and he can essentially put you under house arrest and you know I have very strong  
views on issues and I you know I felt like if I took that job I'd be on house  
arrest probably on day three so I you know I um I was not I was  
never interested in that Reed had to run but let's just thank him for appearing on the Pod and I thought good  
conversation and but I thought thought he approached it in in good faith kudos  
to him for stepping into the lion's den so he was great yeah sorry Bobby keep going so Bobby let me ask you a question  
um you are reportedly a never Trumper you there's massive Fallout you  
cited personally for you as a resident of Malibu uh the extremely talented  
woman you're married to based on everything I can tell maybe not a fan of trump so this is maybe causing some  
domestic and some local Town issues for you tell me about your journey from a never Trumper all your friends are I  
think never trumpers to now joining with Trump that's got to be a hard decision no yeah it was a very hardw wrenched  
decision but you know I I would my whole kind of Journey was over the  
past uh 17 months was uh was just was kind of a series of  
um a very very difficult uh transition  
you know away from the Democratic party the Democratic party was you know the party my my family is  
one of the central pillars of the democratic party my family has been in  
the Democratic party since 1848 since my great grandparents came over and my  
great-grandfather honey Fitz was the first Irish Catholic mayor at Boston his contemporary Patrick Joseph  
Kennedy was a state senator and political boss in Massachusetts it's my grandfather Joseph Kennedy was you know  
FDR's Treasurer he was the first head of the secc he was the Ambassador uh to to uh  
the court of St James deeply deeply immersed in Democratic Party politics  
all of my uncles Joe Kennedy who was a delegate to the 1940 uh convention who spoke there a featured  
speaker and then was killed in World War II my uncle John Kennedy was first Irish  
Catholic President of of um um of uh the United States my other uncle Ted Kennedy  
who's one of the longest I think the second or third longest serving member of of the United States Senate is is uh  
his name on more bills than any other senator in the United States history and then of course my father who was  
attorney general and I sort of walk away from that party  
was uh you know I guess it was very very difficult for me and I was actually the  
last person in my campaign to see that to understand the necessity of that that the Democratic  
party was not going to allow me to uh to compete fairly that they you know they  
had rigged the system against us in ways that were really quite extraordinary they had just walked away  
from democracy they were cancelling primaries they had uh they had chosen their candidate and  
it was going to be uh President Biden and they and I was really a nuisance to them and so my voice was not allow out  
there and uh and so that was difficult  
and then um uh and then leaving you know I I declared independence in  
October and then uh joining Trump president Trump was yeah that  
I I burnt a lot of bridges I burnt my boats let me put it that way clearly clearly is definitely um a challenging  
thing to to go from your family being the Bedrock of the democratic party and  
Trump being you know uh obviously seen as an existential Risk by the Democratic  
party so what what should Americans know about the state of politics and fairness  
Falling out with the Democratic Party  
in America based on what you've learned what what what do you want the American people to know about the process of  
selecting a president well and you know I do want to say that I  
feel like I didn't really re leave the Democratic party the Democratic party left me and left the um and left the  
ruins of uh uh the the infrastructure  
that I think my uncle and father had that had made them Democrats if you went on a list of all  
of the priorities that Robert Kennedy that John Kennedy had I would check  
every box you know they were antiw War they were anti censorship they were they were against  
the corporate control of of our country um the this this corrupt merger of state  
and corporate power that now has emerged as the dominant governing model in our  
country um the Democratic party has changed demographically uh when I grew I grew up  
in a Democratic party that was the party of the working class in our country that was party of um small businesses that  
was the party of the poor um in the last election President Biden got roughly  
half of the country voting Forum but that half controlled 70% of of  
GDP and president Trump got about half the country voting for him and that half  
repres represents about 30% of GDP so we've had this  
inversion where the Democratic party has become the party of wealth of  
Elites um and I would say very insular Elites and the um and the Republican  
party is now the party of the poor the working class and uh it's been you know  
for me to watch that I've been on the front lines of watching it and um you know the  
values that held the Democratic party together are no longer there it's held  
together by uh a a sense of tribalism a sense of and a great great sense of what  
I would say orchestrated fear of Donald Trump it's the only value that really  
dominates any discussion if I talk about censorship to a Democrat they'll say yes but Donald  
Trump is going to become a dictator if you talk about Children's Health they'll say never mind that  
Donald Trump is the only thing we can worry about if you talk about you know about the history of the democratic  
party's opposition to war'll say forget all that the only thing we can focus on is Donald Trump  
and uh that's a very very dismaying and I would say dangerous form of um  
orchestrated tribalism and one of the other features of the democratic party is this um this need to control this  
mistrust of the of the pleite mistrust of the demos you know demos is a Greek  
word for people and the Democratic party doesn't trust the people that's why they have to get rid of Elections that's why  
they had to get me off the Bel I got um I I did something everybody said  
all the pundits said could never be done so I got on the ballot in every state I got a million people that sign their  
sign signatures petitioning me on the ballot and the Democratic party strategy  
rather than to use the3 billion doar it had to amplify a message and inspire  
people and and talk about a vision and and the virtues of its candidates instead use them money to try to get me  
off the ballot get Cornell off the Cornell get Jill Stein to use the courts  
to use the the uh enforcement agencies including the Secret Service the CIA the  
FBI to try to rig the election and it's EXA and It ultimately comes down to this  
mistrust of the people which we're seeing now all over we're seeing the kind of two big forces  
emerge one is a populist force and the other is a force of control of Ironclad control we saw  
Europe has already fallen you know you saw the arrest of paval durov last week  
which was extraordinary you know the the arrest of the the the guy who founded  
telegram um because he was hosting uh political  
descent and and and you know the European commission is already openly  
censoring content so they did not need to arrest him they can take off you know whatever they  
want but they went through the to the trouble of actually and probably with us  
encouragement you know catching him when he happened to land for a refueling stop in France France has this extraordinary  
tradition of free speech that you know began with the French Revolution and then again in the 1880s they passed all  
these incredible laws their commitment to free speech is as robust as that in  
the United States and yet now you know and then and then two weeks before that  
you had this crazy European commissioner jry uh Britton saying that uh ordering ordering  
Elan musk not interview Donald Trump a former president of the United States  
the the nominee of of one of the two major political parties and the world is  
not allowed to hear his point of view yeah it's extraordinary but that is what's coming to this country and you  
can already and a Democratic party is that the party of control and  
it's party of not trusting the people let's Bobby let's talk about something then let's assume that this  
Potential role in the Trump Administration, Make America Healthy Again agenda  
election goes in the direction of now your preferred Direction which is Donald  
Trump wins what role would you play and what is your agenda what is it that you  
want to accomplish and explain make America healthy again in that context  
maybe yeah I mean I it's the three issues ending censorship and that's  
pretty easy to do you can do it with a series of executive orders ending the Ukraine war which is complex but I think  
can be done very very quickly and uh and then you know the food issue now it's the food it's  
medicin it's corruption in the Regulatory Agencies but would you be a secretary in that Administration would  
you be a special advisor there's no I you know there there is  
no deal in terms of me getting a particular post so there's just an  
understanding that there would be some kind of co-governance and the Trump people have already  
demonstrated their good faith by um inviting me to be on the transition team  
you know as one of the co-chairs and and they've done something really wonderful which is um to bring Tulsi Gabbert in  
who shares a lot of my views on this issue as the other co-chair and I think that's a signal  
that they're sending that they are sincere about um I'm you know making a  
commitment to these issues what what should parents know about uh your thoughts on how to raise  
kids in a healthy way make America healthy again are there any vaccines that you would say you would advise  
parents to take for their kids and how should they look at the industrial food complex you know if you were sitting  
with us as parents you know uh just having lunch what would you tell us we  
should do with our own kids I mean the big problem is you can't really trust the government to tell you the  
truth the agencies are all compromised they all have very very bad uh conflicts  
almost all the people for example on the on the food on the um food  
recommendation committees at FDA are people who are part of the food  
industry and the same is true on you know the on pharmaceutical side the  
people are making decisions about what's good for you are actually people who are  
making huge amounts of profit on those recommendations and so you can't really trust the recommendations  
are um are in your best interest and you know what we know is that uh there is no  
more profitable there's no bigger profit Center or industry in this country than  
a sick child you know they and a sick child is a lifetime customer lifetime  
consumer of very very expensive products and you have this alliance  
between the food industry and the pharmaceutical industry to keep our children sick to get them addicted you  
know in the 70s and 80s um the the the tobacco industry was  
under attack and the two biggest tobacco companies and out um and bought all the  
big food companies R jrisco you're referring to you yeah and craft and you  
know so you had Philip Morris by Craft and they took a lot of the scientist  
from the tobacco industry who are experts on making products addictive and they put them to work on  
making food addictive on making Ultra processors so adding AG greed inset um that make food uh uh that  
destroy the the the sa ability of food so that food doesn't fill you up so you're always craving  
more um and those products many of them are products you know we have almost a  
thousand chemicals in our foods that are banned in Europe and banned in other countries um and  
uh and those products are are products that were have been  
introduced by by chemist that did not exist before and  
the body does not handle them well well and you know we're seeing this explosion chronic disease when my  
uncle was President 6% of Americans had chronic disease you know what the budget  
was for chronic disease and when my uncle was President zero there wasn't any drugs for it there was no uh there  
was no expenditures on chronic disease today it's $4.3 trillion it's five times  
our military budget and the people who are making money are the the  
pharmaceutical companies the uh the insurance companies which actually you would think insurance companies would  
want people to be well they actually make more money if they're sick on the uh the hospital is the  
medical cartel the people we trust to make advice to us about our health are  
actually compromise and that's the difficult part you've got to unravel that corporate capture freeberg when you  
hear this some people might say uh this sounds like a grand conspiracy theory uh but much of it rings true to I think  
many of us who are parents watching kids you know uh and watching the prevalence of obesity watching pharmaceutical drugs  
to counter that and all the money that's made from it and then seeing when people eat clean and they're healthy maybe  
there there's less there so freeberg when you hear Bobby's uh position here  
as a scientist who sold the company to Monsanto climate.com and who's working on food today what Rings true about what  
Bob's saying and what do you disagree with if anything yeah there there are aspects of industrialized food and  
processed food that are bad for people and I I do agree should be should be  
changed I don't I know a lot of people that work at the USDA a lot of people that work in other government  
organizations that don't make a lot of money um they may or may not have worked at other companies but I think that  
there's no economic incent for them to do harm or wrong I think that the real and so I don't think that there's a  
constructive design on doing bad things by any individual I think that there is an unfortunate circumstance where people  
eat bad stuff stuff that tastes better they like it more it sells better and  
the economic incentive in capitalism is to make more of that stuff and sell more of it and as a result the stuff that  
people like that isn't good for them they buy more of and the companies make more money and so they continue to  
invest in selling more and more of that stuff and this goes most processed foods it's terrible it's not good and so I do  
agree that much of this processed food industry is um uh very adverse to health  
but I don't think that there's a grand design by individuals that are malicious and their intent and trying to do it I think that there are people that are  
doing their job on hey this is what the market want government right yeah in the government talking about in government and Private Industry you don't think  
people in Private Industry are trying to make addicting Foods no no I think that yeah the point is like if people buy more of it they're like let's sell more  
of it you know okay and I I you know and if that were illegal if it was illegal to say hey this sort of food product  
should not be made but look alcohol fits the bill too right and we we keep making alcohol and sugar fits the bill the more  
sugar Coca-Cola did a study years ago where they um they kept increasing the  
amount of sugar in Coca colola until they maximally uh got sell through so uh some  
kids liked 60 grams of sugar and 12 ounces of coke some kids like 30 but the perfect level was at 42 G and so that  
study was done by the scientist that worked at Coca-Cola and then they said that's the product it sells it'll sell  
the most and that's the incentive inside of that company that's how that company operates now you could ask yourself the question is that evil is that bad we now  
know that sugar in general is bad the executives at Coca-Cola at AB inbev at other places are trying to make alcohol-free sugar-free Alternatives so  
there's a lot of push by these people Unilever has tried to make a big push towards good food Nestle's tried to do  
the same they've all made these stated commitments to improve the health of the food that they produce but it is quite difficult to be successful in doing that  
and returning money to shareholders the shareholders are like where's the money so I me I think this is the key Point  
you're making chath I think you're clean food effort and I took me a decade to unravel me eating everything in sight  
and lose the 40 pounds but shamat when you hear you know sort of this uh back and forth between Bobby and fredberg  
what's your take on it in terms of and and also the European lifestyle that you live for 10 weeks of the Year what's  
your take on what should happen here and how Bobby can be successful I think what Bobby says Rings true in the way that I  
live my life and I just see it demonstrated on my own body you're right Jason you know my wife's Italian she  
runs an Italian company we she works Italian and  
American hours for 10 months out of the year and for those 10 weeks we go there and we flip schedule but when I'm there  
I'm consuming Italian produce that isn't packed in plastic I go to a a local fruit store I go to the local fish  
vendor and my body changes and I know that  
because the people that see me when I get back they always comment oh did you lose weight oh do you look you look  
thinner or this or that and what's interesting is I actually do a body composition before I leave and after  
I've done this for seven years now and I can tell you that my weight doesn't change that much but my body composition  
is completely different and I don't know what it is except the things that I'm putting in my body that's different and  
so I see it and I'm running a Ab test every day you know the price what's the price of the food chamar like is it more  
in Italy like do you pay more do you think well I've already commented on the fish is outrageous joke yeah um but but  
there are ways to eat at a materially lower price than there is here and the  
access to the ultra processed food is different there you can't get the stuff and when you and when you do find that  
stuff it doesn't have the same you know glycemic and metabolic Lo on your body  
I'm curious what you think of you know OIC and this category of drugs breaking the cycle I think you've  
been against them or they certainly helped me uh with half of my weight loss I know sack's had a good experience as  
well and he's been public about it what are your thoughts on that because it does seem when people take the take the  
glps which exist in your body that they I'm sure there's more research that needs to be done they do break this  
habit I know anecdotally with me I don't crave the foods I craved previously and it did kind of rewire my brain and how I  
look at Food even when I'm off of it so your thoughts on those and and those potentially being a way to break the  
cycle yeah so and this goes to David's point that you know this is we need to  
have cheap food and that that is kind of a an outcome that is an admirable or  
virtuous outcome the problem is the food isn't cheap it it it's cheap on the self  
on the Shelf but it imposes costs on the rest of us that were the externalities  
that were paying elsewhere so when I was a kid the typical pediatrician would see  
one case of juvenile diabetes in his lifetime over a 40 or 50y year career  
one case it was essentially non-existent disase today one out of every three  
children who walks through his office door is diabetic or  
pre-diabetic um when I was a kid the the autism rates were between 1 and  
1500 to 1 and 10,000 Americans and that is still true in my generation  
70-year-old men and my kids generation according to CDC is one out of every 34  
kids some states like California it's one out of every 22 um 77% of Americans are out or 74%  
adults are obese half our kids obesity when when you know 100 years ago  
if you were obese you could get a job in the surf circus it was so unusual so we're now and and who's  
making profit now OIC oic's not going to you can obesity is absolutely and  
diabetes are absolutely treatable by good food that's the cause now  
oamic is a good profit Center for it had for um for Pharma there's a now which  
has been paid for by the company that makes it which is the biggest company in new Europe no  
nordis that in in Denmark where that company is they do not recommend it it  
it the the uh uh the treatment of diabetes the standard of care is diet  
and exercise but that company's entire value is based upon the projections of what is  
going to sell in the United States and it has and that company is pouring tens of millions of dollars into  
lobbying to pass this bill that will make Medicare pay for it for every  
American who obese that could be 74% of people are now eligible I think it's  
$1,500 a week the cost of that will be three trillion a year if you took three  
trillion a year a tiny fraction of that you could buy organic food three meals a day for every human being in the United  
States so wouldn't that be a better expenditure of our money and you know I  
what I would say is the you know the food producers it's not a conspiracy it's just people following perverse  
incentives and there are conspiracies I mean when I sued um Monsanto we got  
emails that showed that the head of the pesticide division Jess Roland for a decade at EPA was secretly working for  
Monsanto the entire time sabotaging studies creating false science that hide the cogenic nature of  
Roundup so there are those kind of instances throughout the federal government but mainly it says perverse  
incentives almost all almost close to 100% of our of our food agricultural  
subsidies go to process food I mean go to commodity agriculture which is the  
feed stock for processed food so and then if you look at mostly mostly for  
mostly for meat the industry controls through lobbying and  
through you know all these other mechanisms for corporate capture controls the expenditures in the food  
stamp program so 70% of the food stamp program goes for processed food 10% goes for sugar drinks like  
Coca-Cola which are just diabetes machines so why are we poisoning poor  
kids in this country the school lunch program the same thing almost 80 I think 77% of food  
food lunch program is terrible foods that are actually poisoning our children and you know don't we you know don't we  
care enough about our kids to say we need you know we we want to care  
about them we want to make sure that they're not sick they are the most precious things in our country shouldn't  
that be the focus and you know whatever we're doing to make them so sick  
when I was a kid 6% of American kids had chronic disease today 60% is that not an  
alarm is that not you know something that we should all be concerned about I will I will agree on um an important  
Point uh you know the the the food stamp program the snap program provides food  
stamps to support 42 million Americans 42 million people rely on food stamps it  
costs $20 billion dollar of federal money per year and as um as Bobby said the number one  
product bought on the food stamp program is soda canned soda and there was an important debate a few years ago about  
whether or not canned soda by the way Bobby you and I probably agree on a lot of things there definitely a lot of  
things we don't agree on but like these aspects I think are just no brainers uh there was a debate a few years ago about  
whether or not canned soda should be allowed as a purchase on the food stamp program or whether it should be fresh  
fruits and vegetables and Grains and other and ultimately there was a food lobbying effort made uh that kept uh caned soda  
on the food stamp program and it is uh again $120 billion of annual federal spend with the biggest line item going  
to can soda to you know feed 42 million Americans and and the the the the connection is completely direct high  
sugar high glycemic index diabetes and other chronic health conditions arise  
from that connection so um definitely aligned with you on the Mis incentives  
and the disincentives in these programs that have been created and they only expand every year Bobby can you comment  
on when people talk about revamping the food supply one of the things that  
sometimes is not allowed to be said is that focusing on organic food and produce can exclude certain communities  
and so there's like this Dei filter that preferring that is almost racist in some way like can you just comment on that  
whole vein of thinking and your thought on that yeah I mean I think feeding people  
poisonous food is racist and by the way the NAACP gets huge amounts of money um  
every year from the food industry it may be one of the biggest I think I think Coca-Cola is the biggest um supporter V  
ACP so a lot of the NGS that are supposed to be concerned about the the  
disproportionate uh impact on minority communities of federal policies have actually been bought off and bought into  
the pro says and you know a lot of times those are the voices you hear saying this is racist what's really racist is  
po poisoning black Americans because these are communities that are food  
deserts um the school lunch program is the you know often times those communities the biggest access that they  
have to food and we're giving them poison food we're you know they many of these communities have no Grocery  
Stores um they you know they no big like they definitely don't have uh Whole  
Foods they don't have access to to those kind of foods shouldn't we have National  
policies that that make sure our people are healthy and you know they use of  
course Market uh Dynamics but also supports we're we're giving billions of dollars in  
agricultural subsidies for Farmers to addict Farmers to to to Growing  
commodity agriculture which is bad food food it's low in nutrients it's high in chemicals it's high in  
pesticides and you know we need to change these perverse incentives so that  
uh and and feed America I you know we what how can anybody argue with this how can anybody  
say that we should not have healthy children that we should be giving people food that is hurting them it's just it  
doesn't make any sense sax any questions for you for Bobby about democracy  
what went down with Biden the fairness of the democratic party I know you've got some strong feelings on it so I just  
wanted to give you your red meat and your window here I'm I'm sure a lot of his confirming for you what he's saying  
um and you know I'll be honest I think what the Democratic party did to you Mr Kennedy was absolutely abhorent and  
disgusting and it it really is um infuriating to me especially what the mainstream media did um and I'm glad  
that we got to have you on early on our podcast at least to some of your ideas get out there but uh let's give Sax's  
red meet here because you joining Trump is a a wild card I don't think any of us  
saw coming well let me pick up on those themes jcal uh first of all I want to commend Bobby on running an upbeat and  
Sacks recaps RFK Jr's campaign, RFK Jr. on Trump's legacy  
positive campaign you know you were and I still are the most articulate and  
Powerful champion of free speech over censorship civil liberties over the surveillance State peace over War you've  
spoken about the issue of chronic Health which it to be honest is an issue I didn't know that much about but I think you've put it now on the political radar  
screen in a way that it's not going away uh so I think you ran a a very Noble and  
effective campaign and I think like you said it was a campaign for the soul of the democratic party you know I think  
you represented issues that in the days of your father and President johnf  
Kennedy these would have been Democratic party issues how did the Democratic party respond they effectively ran you  
out they did not give you the chance they conducted law fair to keep you off the ballot they didn't let you debate I  
heard your running mates say they even tried to infiltrate your campaign and all the while this party was claiming to  
be the party of democracy find that incredibly hypocritical I think that if they had  
given you the opportunity to debate I think we now know what would have happened I mean we saw what happened  
when Biden actually debated Trump is there's a complete implosion of Biden's campaign we  
discovered that indeed the Democratic party had been hiding his condition for  
a long time and when he was finally forced to debate didn't have a teleprompter or a script it became  
extremely obvious what happened then they basically put in a new nominee  
who's never been voted on K Harris has never received one primary vote it was  
done through a process that was opaque we still don't know how it went down I  
have to disagree with Reed that um Biden did it in a voluntary way Biden went  
Kicking and Screaming I mean he basically said publicly over and over again I'm not leaving the race I'm in this race he tweeted it he said it he  
said only God Almighty could get me out of the race and then it was reported that Nancy Pelosi went to him and said we can do this the easy way or the hard  
way you said God Almighty she might be God Almighty she might  
Bey but the point is there was nothing Democratic about this and now we have a new Democratic Party nomy who refuses to  
do press conferences refuses to do solo interviews refuses to take questions  
from the Press who's hiding herself effectively and yet this party again claims to be the party of democracy I  
find it just almost um maddening or or ging again in its hypocrisy and I just I  
don't see how everybody can't see through this it's just not the way that  
democracy is supposed to work and I certainly don't think that the people engaging these tactics can be cloaking  
themselves in all this High fluing rhetoric of of democracy it's just absurd and so I feel like I'm in the  
place that you are Bobby you know as viewers of this pod know I did not start off supporting Trump in the primaries I  
supported you in the Democratic primary and I did fundraisers for DeSantis and V and that was in large part because I  
think of the job that DeSantis did as Governor but when it came to the general the realization that I came to is that  
Trump is the indispensable figure in our current politics for marshalling this populist energy to resist this  
hypocritical Elite authoritarianism that wants to engage in censorship over debate that seems to  
want to protect and defend this um surveillance State over anything it wants to do that wants to keep all these  
wars going uh even when they don't make sense when we could have found a way to negotiate a diplomatic end to them and  
so I'm kind of delighted that you've kind of come around to this opinion too I know you have your reservations about Trump I'm not saying that Trump is  
perfect I mean I think he's a uh he's human I mean he's a flawed vessel but at the end of the day he is the the choice  
that represents again these populist forces resisting authoritarianism sorry this is more of a statement than a  
question but I'll let you react to all of that well let me react the last thing you said about President Trump I  
think if president Trump wins um that people are going to see very different  
president Trump than they did during the first term um I think he's changed as a person uh and I've known him for you  
know 30 years I've sued him I've litigated against him and and had a friendship with him even when I was  
litigating against him and by the way successfully against him but I I think he is um he's focus on  
his legacy he said many interesting things to me about what he did wrong the last time and about how  
he filled his you know he had no idea he was going to win he had no idea how to govern and people descended on him the  
day that he got elected and said you got to appoint this guy appoint this guy and he said you know I I appointed a lot of  
people I shouldn't appointed I know who they are now he also said something interesting to me he said uh because the  
Democrats one of the big sort of fulgums of their Terror of trump is that he's  
going to implement this Heritage Foundation you know uh blueprint which is called uh  
project 2025 and he brought this issue up to me and he said you know they always telling  
me I'm I'm for project 2025 I never read project 2025 until they started accusing  
me of it he said that was written by a right-wing ass this what he what he said  
he said there are leftwing and there was there right-wing assh and it was a right-wing who wrote that  
thing and then he started going through it so I you know I think there there's a  
lot and I think he's interested in his legacy now he wants to leave behind some  
accomplishments and he wants to make our country better and I think he's um you  
know he's listening to a wider range of voices and has he's preparing to govern  
right now and you know I'm going to be on the transition committee picking the  
people who are going to govern to he's going to be there there's going to be a wide diversity of of  
stakeholders but he's listening to more than just that kind of narrow right-wing band that people are terrify it would be  
great if you could get to him because you know he he really did present well on this podcast and had like a very good  
moment in that first half of the RNC and then he started defaulting back to and I know a lot of moderates like myself hate  
this about him and it's a big part of why we don't like him is he goes back to Insel Comics goes back to race goes back  
to gender you know and it's just like dude we that Trump 1.0 is what people  
don't want they don't want chaotic Trump they want you know post assassination  
attempt Trump and it's just so infuriating well a lot of people feel that way J con I think at the end of the  
day you and others are going to have to decide do you want to support the candidate who has the right policies but  
maybe there's style points that you don't like about him because I think that the things you're talking about the  
Mean Tweets and so forth at the end of the day I think they're stylistic things I don't think they go deep to to policy  
or how he would govern or do you want to support a campaign that is running on  
Vibes and joy you know that has this superficiality that you like but there's  
nothing underneath it and when we do learn something underneath that when we actually learn a policy then all the the  
people who are supporting her have to say oh well she's not really going to do that she's not going to do that so the  
best thing you can say about her campaign is that she's not going to be able to accomplish the things that she says she wants to accomplish good news  
basis on which to vote for a president good news is I'm in Texas so I can put in my my Bobby Kennedy vote as a protest  
vote and it doesn't make a difference and I can I can I respond to the other part of David's question to me sure they  
um and you know I think to me the most troubling thing about what's happening now you have you've had two Democratic  
candidates who've not been able to give unscripted interviews which is extraordinary I mean my father  
and Uncle we're so proud of you know the United States our capacity to engage in debate to defend who we were in the  
world to defend a vision of our country to articulate it to the rest of the world to be the leaders of the Free  
World and um and have a command of the facts and of knowledge and to be  
eloquent and um how can you be a leader in the world what does the rest of the  
world think of us right now I mean what could they possibly think we have two Democratic party candidates  
were not able to explain themselves in an  
interview the other day something yeah I really I think point in which is if you  
want to if you want the job of handling the nuclear codes you got to do an interview first and you know how can you  
go 30 39 days without talking to the Press without being able to defend your  
record to explain who you are to the American people and if you talk to Democrats about this and you can get  
past the anger and past the vi on this kind of wall of of tribal resistance to any new knowledge  
coming in what they or any con contrary facts what they'll say is well we're not  
really voting for comma we're voting for the apparatus then you ask the next question  
how has that apparatus serve you you know has the open border surve you has  
the $35 trillion debt surve you has all the endless war surve you has the  
destruction the American middle class highest inflation rate in a  
generation has any of that actually you know has that apparatus produced  
something for the United States that you're so proud of that you want to blindly vote without knowing who you're  
voting for anyway that that I mean and and uh KLA and Waltz will do an  
interview Dana Bash tonight uh the night we're taping this on Thursday so we'll see maybe she'll miraculously do 10  
podcasts and she'll be dynamic but it certainly doesn't look good that they  
filibustered with Biden and gave them only most favored nation interviews I do respect the fact that we've had so many  
great candidates come on this pod and have 90minut two-hour discussions I'm very proud of the work we've done here  
and and Bobby you were a keep piece of that and we really appreciate you coming on early and having these debates and coming here today to talk about it just  
me means the world for you to come back and talk about this wish you great success with make America healthy again I think it's incredibly Noble  
independent of how I feel about Trump January 6 abortion any of those issues I respect the fact that you want to make  
America healthy again uh and I wish you great continued success with that and we
