> Making decisions is an integral part of life and can have a profound impact on our personal and professional lives. Whether it's a small decision like choosing what to eat for lunch or a more complex decision such as choosing the right career path, it's important to have a structured approach to decision making. This is where decision making frameworks come in - they provide a structured way to approach problems and make informed decisions.
> 
> The use of decision making frameworks can be a powerful tool for individuals and organizations alike. By following a systematic approach, decision making frameworks can help you weigh options, avoid common pitfalls, and make more informed decisions. In this guide, we'll introduce you to several popular and effective decision making frameworks, including Second Order Thinking, Revolving Door Decisions, Decision Balance Sheets, Regret Minimization Framework, Tim Ferris' Fear Setting exercise, 1st Principles Thinking, SWOT Analysis, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Pareto Analysis, Force Field Analysis, Decision Tree Analysis, Fishbone Diagram, and Eisenhower Matrix.
> 
> Each of the frameworks covered in this guide will be accompanied by a clear explanation of what it is for, who first invented it, when it should be used, an example of its use, a step-by-step guide for how to use it, and useful links for further reading. We'll also explain the benefits of using decision making frameworks and why they can be powerful in terms of leverage.
> 
> This guide is designed to be used in conjunction with a Notion template that incorporates databases to help you work through each of the framework options. The template will provide a structured and interactive approach to decision making, allowing you to put the frameworks into practice and achieve the best possible outcomes. So, let's get started on this journey to make better decisions and achieve our goals!

> **Leverage in decision making and how it relates to the use of decision making frameworks.**
> 
> Leverage refers to the ability to use a relatively small amount of resources to create a large impact or outcome. In decision making, leveraging can be achieved by making informed and strategic choices that maximize the benefits and minimize the costs. When considering the concept of leverage in decision making, it is important to understand that making a decision that is right for one aspect of a situation may not necessarily be the best decision in terms of maximizing leverage. By using decision making frameworks, individuals can weigh the potential benefits and costs of each decision and determine the best course of action to maximize leverage.
