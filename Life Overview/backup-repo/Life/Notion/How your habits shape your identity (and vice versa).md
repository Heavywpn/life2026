  

==**Changing our habits is challenging for 2 reasons:**==

1. ==**We try to change the wrong thing**==
2. ==**We try to change our habits in the wrong way**==

### ==Layer 1: Changing your outcomes==

==**This level is concerned with changing your results**==

==**Most of the goals you set are associated with his level of change**==

  

### ==Layer 2: Changing your process==

==**This level is concerned with changing your habits & systems**==

==**Most of the habits you build are associated with this level**==

  

### ==Layer 3: Changing your identity==

==**This level is concerned with changing your beliefs**==

==**Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level**==

  

> ==**Outcomes are about what you get.**  
> **Processes are about what you do.**  
> **Identity is about what you believe.**==

  

==**Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.**==

> ==**Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs**==

  

==**There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity behind the habits.**==

==**Behaviour that is incongruent with the self will not last.**==

  

==**The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity.**==

==**It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.**==

  

> ==**True behaviour change is identity change**==

  

==**You might start a habits because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.**==

==**Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.**==

  

==**The goal is not to read a book, it’s to become a reader**  
**The goal is not to run a marathon, it’s to become a runner**  
**The goal is not to create YouTube videos, it’s to become a YouTuber**==

  

> ==**Your behaviours are usually a reflection of your identity**==

  

==**What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are, either consciously or unconsciously.**==

  

==**When your behaviours and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behaviour change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.**==

  

==**When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact**==

  

==**The real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way.**==

### The 2-step process to changing your identity

  

> ==**Your identity emerges out of your habits**==

  

> ==**Your habits is how you embody your identity**==

  

==**The more you repeat a behaviour, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behaviour**==

  

==**The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it**==

  

> ==**Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become**==

  

==**Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity**==

  

==**The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do**==

  

> ==**If nothing changes, nothing changes**==

  

==**It is a simple 2-step process:**==

1. ==**Decide the type of person you want to be**==
2. ==**Prove it to yourself with small wins**==

  

==**“What would a healthy person do?”**==

  

==**If you act like a healthy person long enough, eventually you’ll become one**==

  

> ==**Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shape your habits**==

  

  

### The real reason habits matter

  

==**The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.**==

  

==**Your identity is not set in stone**==

  

> ==**Habits are not about having something, it’s about becoming someone**==

  

==**Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.**==
