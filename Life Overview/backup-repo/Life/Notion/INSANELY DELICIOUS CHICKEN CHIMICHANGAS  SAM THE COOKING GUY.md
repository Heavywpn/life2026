00:01:16.479 intelligent than i am ladies and  
00:01:17.759 gentlemen if that wasn't obvious okay uh  
00:01:20.159 here's the plan we make a rub for the  
00:01:22.000 chicken we get the chicken on the smoker  
00:01:24.159 if you don't have a smoker i'll talk you  
00:01:25.600 through that there's no problem we're  
00:01:26.960 gonna make a little avocado crema stuff  
00:01:28.799 uh sauce chicken comes off we take a  
00:01:30.960 bite we cut it up we make the  
00:01:33.600 chimichanga and then we're there happy  
00:01:36.640 happy really happy right boy  
00:01:39.759 right we begin with a little bowl and  
00:01:41.280 the following ingredients we start with  
00:01:43.920 smoked paprika we'll go about  
00:01:46.320 three tablespoons i think or something  
00:01:47.840 like that two tablespoons i don't know  
00:01:49.680 whatever that is and then we'll go a  
00:01:51.200 tablespoon of uh basically everything  
00:01:53.119 else so black pepper garlic powder  
00:01:56.240 oregano a little thyme a little cayenne  
00:01:59.200 about a half a tablespoon of this kosher  
00:02:01.360 salt what do we do now  
00:02:03.840 thank you yes we do and i like to mix  
00:02:05.759 like that break up some of the oregano  
00:02:08.080 because it's kind of leafy right  
00:02:10.800 let's get our chicken all right here's  
00:02:12.560 what we've got uh boneless skinless  
00:02:14.720 chicken thighs you know i probably  
00:02:17.120 should have bought the  
00:02:18.800 skin on bone in i just really wasn't  
00:02:21.599 thinking so these are not going to take  
00:02:23.520 nearly as long as the other ones would  
00:02:25.520 so everybody gets just a little oil and  
00:02:27.520 then we season spread them out a bit  
00:02:30.480 like this  
00:02:31.440 like a nice decent seasoning on these  
00:02:33.680 things you know here's where you're  
00:02:34.959 gonna add a bunch of flavor we know what  
00:02:36.800 chicken tastes like by itself apparently  
00:02:39.040 everything else in the world but it's  
00:02:41.040 generally pretty plain so  
00:02:43.440 we flip our little kids here oil on this  
00:02:46.000 side  
00:02:47.120 and  
00:02:48.400 more  
00:02:49.280 so you know that i prefer chicken thighs  
00:02:51.599 in almost every case max prefers chicken  
00:02:56.080 breasts and i think  
00:02:58.400 smoking a chicken breast you're taking  
00:03:00.400 it  
00:03:01.040 what can be a dry piece of poultry and  
00:03:03.760 drying it out even more but i feel bad  
00:03:06.080 because i always get my way so i bought  
00:03:09.280 a chicken breast for max just to smoke  
00:03:11.280 right along with this as a bit of an  
00:03:12.959 experiment i like it thank you you're  
00:03:15.280 welcome these little things that we do

00:07:00.240 to be nice forget what the haters say  
00:07:02.880 this is about you making food that you  
00:07:05.520 like if you like this you use this if  
00:07:07.759 you don't like this don't use it but  
00:07:10.080 don't let people like greg rampy tell  
00:07:12.560 you what you can and cannot like cool  
00:07:15.520 cool great now we're gonna make an  
00:07:17.440 avocado crema with maybe the world's

00:10:04.240 165 is the approved number but if you  
00:10:06.560 yank it at 160 it'll carry on a little  
00:10:10.079 bit you'll be close enough and nobody's  
00:10:11.839 getting sick now these little guys so  
00:10:13.839 this kid's quite plump here let's look  
00:10:16.160 this guy's at 130 degrees this thin  
00:10:19.839 little kid he's probably got to be there  
00:10:22.600 147 is that we're getting close this is  
00:10:25.440 140.  
00:10:26.800 all right let's just flip them over  
00:10:29.440 this is probably half hour to 40 minutes  
00:10:32.000 for the thin guys this is going to be  
00:10:33.600 closer to an hour i can see that but  
00:10:36.000 it's all going to be outstandingly  
00:10:37.519 delicious and going to make for an  
00:10:39.360 amazing chimi okay very quickly because  
00:10:41.839 we think it might rain it says it's 2 40  
00:10:45.680 where we are now it says 100 chance of  
00:10:48.880 rain in 20 minutes so  
00:10:50.880 we got to get going but i want to tell  
00:10:52.320 you max's sex education talk story there  
00:10:55.360 he was he thinks he was eight feel like  
00:10:57.760 he was a little older but he was going  
00:10:59.760 to camp with his older cousin they were  
00:11:01.839 going to be in the same cabin and you  
00:11:03.839 know we're here to prepare our children  
00:11:05.519 for what comes at them in life and i  
00:11:08.399 felt there could be a moment when the  
00:11:10.480 older cousin and the older kids in the  
00:11:12.320 cabin were talking about sex and  
00:11:14.640 somebody would glance over at max and he  
00:11:16.399 would be like a deer in the headlights  
00:11:17.839 not knowing anything and they would go  
00:11:19.680 oh little man actually doesn't know  
00:11:21.120 we're talking about and i didn't  
00:11:24.480 oh

00:11:28.160 want to put max in that position i'm a  
00:11:30.560 protector i want him to be prepared so  
00:11:33.279 we go to t.o leo's it's a mexican chain  
00:11:36.240 for dinner one night we're sitting  
00:11:37.600 across the table we order the food has

00:11:54.959 and that deer in the headlights thing is  
00:11:56.800 there

00:11:59.600 about how works and where it goes

00:12:06.160 any idea so we're all done he sat  
00:12:08.399 through the whole thing he hasn't said a  
00:12:10.000 word he's just nodded

00:14:28.079 now  
00:14:29.279 we're going to take a toothpick to make  
00:14:31.279 sure this doesn't undo  
00:14:33.040 so a toothpick a day  
00:14:35.199 should keep the burrito from breaking

00:15:04.399 it's really a few minutes guys doesn't  
00:15:06.399 take very long you have an option though  
00:15:08.240 if you don't want to use oil in a pan  
00:15:10.240 like this put on a baking sheet put your  
00:15:12.560 oven to 350 brush it lightly with oil  
00:15:15.040 and then put it in for about 20 25  
00:15:17.519 minutes the outside will get crispy

00:16:06.880 little bit of that that's called sour  
00:16:08.639 cream i think a little bit of this too

00:17:21.760 right we got legitimate rain here in san  
00:17:23.520 diego flash flood warnings  
00:17:26.000 the health what's happening in the world  
00:17:28.319 shop [sdcg.com](http://sdcg.com/) for great stuff right we  
00:17:33.039 were a little rushed at the end of that  
00:17:34.640 because because of the rain  
00:17:37.360 and it slowed down calmed a bit  
00:17:40.400 which now gives me an opportunity to  
00:17:42.160 address something that i forgot max's  
00:17:44.320 chicken breast i'll admit i've been a  
00:17:46.320 hater oh look at the juice just dripped  
00:17:48.480 out of it you missed it for a long time  
00:17:50.880 i've been a hater you don't have to rub  
00:17:52.640 it in my face i'm coming clean here  
00:17:55.440 for long  
00:17:56.559 for a long time i've been a hater and i  
00:17:58.160 need to say i was wrong in this case i  
00:18:00.960 was wrong  
00:18:02.080 a smoked chicken breast you can see we  
00:18:04.480 cut it we took one piece out and we all  
00:18:06.320 took a bite it was juicy af i like to  
00:18:08.880 think it had a little something to do  
00:18:10.240 with the way i handled it  
00:18:12.240 put it on the smoker  
00:18:14.480 but it's probably the fact that it did  
00:18:16.559 not dry it out so change the thinking if  
00:18:18.960 that needs to be changed i apologize to  
00:18:21.360 all the chickens whose breasts i have  
00:18:23.760 maligned
