- ◎ ⇠
    
    Remember my [Life OS Tour Video](https://youtu.be/BnMNLfFIbQ4) is a great place to see an overview of using Tasks and Projects:
    
    - **1. Setting Up New Projects**
        - I recommend starting in the Dashboard when new to this template: this is where you can set up your Goals, Milestones and - notably for this task manager: Projects can be created ready to add tasks into.
        - Once you have created your Projects you can view them on the [[Projects 2]] Dashboard, or return to the homepage [[Notion Life OS Live]] and manage all tasks from there.
    - **2. Adding New Tasks & Processing Them from The Inbox**
        
        1. Add all the individual tasks you have on your mind to the Tasks inbox on the home screen
            
            ![[Screenshot_2023-03-23_052256.png]]
            
            or on the [[Quick Drop Inbox 2]] page.
            
            ![[Screenshot_2023-03-23_052636.png]]
            
        2. You can now **sort & organise your tasks.**
            1. Use the **daily priority** field if you want them to be in a certain order on the day of delivery
            2. adding a **do date** means they appear in the main task lists, not adding a do date means they will only be visible in the related Project you add them into.
            3. Set a start _and end date_ in the Do Date column if you want a task to last over more than one day on your time lines.
            4. You can link tasks to other databases as needed, and even set a **context** tag so you can e.g. filter a view of tasks by ‘computer’ or a person tag like ‘mum’ (think People, Places or Things)
            5. Setting A **Deadline date** means they will also appear in the deadlines views.
                
                ![[Screenshot_2022-02-18_at_16.56.01.png]]
                
            6. Adding them to a **Related Project** in the relation column sorts them into the system ready to go - so input this last.
        3. Once you assign them to a related project, they will clear from the inbox. Remember: They will then be filtered into the Action Dashboard views if you have assigned a ‘**Do on’** date to them. If they don't have a due date, you can view them in the relevant **project** page. You can also view your master under the ⚙️ System toggle if you need to.
            
            ![[Screenshot_2023-03-23_053630.png]]
            
        
          
        
        1. In all task views: entries disappear when the Status Column is set to ‘Done’ or is checked
            - You can change how you view Status in any view - by selecting properties, Status, and then edit Property - where you can choose Show as to choose if it is displayed as a Checkbox or a Select View
                
                ![[LifeOS_Guide_Set_Task_Status_View.gif]]
                
        2. If you want to more permanently delete completed tasks there is an Archive Task Bin in [[P.A.R.A Dashboard 2]] - this is simply the filtered where ‘Done’ is checked. Select the all in bulk and delete.
        
        - If you want to share the system with friends, family or colleagues, you can use the Assignee column to Assign Tasks (you’ll need a paid Notion plan to add more team members).
        - Once a task is related to a project, tasks can be viewed within the filtered projects page , and in the master action dashboards on the and the dashboard.
    - **3. Using Sub-Tasks & Dependencies**
        
        Headlines
        
        - Create SubTasks in the Parent Task Page or by creating a new task and then selecting it’s Parent, or by using the New Task or New Parent & Sub-Task Buttons
        - Think of Parent Tasks as Master tasks with more than one action. Think of the Related Projects as larger projects that contain multiple parent and sub-tasks. E.g. A project might be _‘My Hobby’, ‘My Online Business’, Home Renovation’_ etc.
        - All new tasks begin as without being blocked or ‘dependent’ on anything else. They are marked as ‘🟢 Actionable’.
        - If you want a task to be dependent on another (marked as ‘🔴 Waiting’ until another is completed) you can link them in the **Timeline View** but dragging an arrow from one to another, or simply use the ‘blocked by’ or ‘blocking’ column to select dependent tasks.
        - Watch this video for a full guide to sub-tasks and dependencies!

            > [https://youtu.be/KtWDpto_vTY](https://youtu.be/KtWDpto_vTY)  
            
        
          
        
        Process
        
        - You can either create a single task or a parent task with sub-tasks. The quickest way to do both is to use the quick Buttons on the task manager views and does much of the programming for you (including setting dependencies.
            
            ![[BC_SC_Notion_05.04.2023_0017712x.png]]
            
        - To Add a sub-task to an existing task, or create new sub-tasks within a parent click into the task, make sure the new Task Template has been selected and then add sub-tasks in view at the top of the page.
            
            ![[LifeOS_Guide_New_SubTask.gif]]
            
        - To Set a task as dependent: use the Blocking or blocked by relations within the parent or sub task to set what it is waiting on or blocking. You can also do this between any task and any other in the system.
        
        ![[LifeOS_Guide_Dependenices_Demo_Timeline.gif]]
        
    - **4. Using Recurring Tasks**
        
        You can create **recurring tasks** in two ways with this system
        
        - **A.** Set up Automated Recurring Tasks using Notions Recurring Database Templates* (Recommended)
            
            Using Notions Recurring Database Templates to set up automatically generated entries is the newest and best way to create recurring tasks in Notion beyond using a 3rd party API workaround.
            
            1. Click on the down arrow next to the ‘==NEW’== button on any task database view and duplicate the existing the Template called ==‘Duplicate for New Recurring Task’==
                
                ![[BC_SC_Notion_05.04.2023_0017812x.png]]
                
            2. Click on the ‘…’ for the new copy, and edit the template to title it and add any pre-filled columns you need (notably give it a related Project)
            3. Click on the ‘…’ again for the task and select the top option ‘Repeat’ and set the recurrence you want. Use ‘Weekly’ if you wish the task to generate on selected days of the week.
                
                ![[BC_SC_Notion_05.04.2023_0017792x.png]]
                
            4. The recurring task is now ready to automatically generate - you will see it both in the main task list views, and in the ‘Recurring Today’ tabs in the Action Dashboard due to it having a ‘Recurring Today’ tag in the Status column.
            5. If you want to move a recurring task to a new Do Date once generated - just add a Do Date as normal and it will override the generated date and be moved in the calendar.
            6. **If you want to move a recurring task to a new Do Date** once generated - just add a Do Date as normal and it will override the generated date and be moved in the calendar.
            
            You can watch my guide to recurring Database Items here:

        - **B.** Setting-Up The Generate Recurring Tasks Button
            
            This is to Pre-populate the Task calendar by generating recurring tasks with *my old method available in the [[My Calendars 2]] view
            
            1. Create any tasks you want to create as recurring tasks within the main task list calendar. Set a Recurring Tag, contexts, and link it a project etc.
            2. Above the Task Calendar is the '**+ Generate 1 Month of Recurring Tasks**' button. hover over it and click on the 'Configure' Cog button.
            3. You'll see some example Recurring Tasks created in the same way. Drag your Tasks from the calendar into the box to turn them into pre-formatted templates.
            4. If the task is weekly Duplicate it to create 4 versions. You can do this quickly by hovering over it or selecting it and using 'cmd + D'. Rename as needed so they are not called 'Copy of...' You can do this quickly using 'cmd + Shift + R'.
            5. ==Make sure you assign the recurring task template inside the task itself so these tasks appear in your Recurring Tasks view on== ==.== ==@Simon== ==is this true?==
            6. Once you are happy with your Month's worth of recurring tasks, close the template button, click the button and then drag the generated task to the correct days. Just generate and drag each month as needed!
            
            You can watch my Guide video to this older method here:

    - **Action / Homepage Dashboard Views Explained**
        
        Use this to see an overview of the week’s Tasks
        
        Click on the titles to jump to an identical view on a single page (great for Mobile) or the toggle to drop it down on the current page.
        
        ![[BC_SC_Notion_05.04.2023_0018222x.png]]
        
        - This is a view of highlighted projects from the [[Projects 2]] Database. Any thing checked as Highlighted Turns up here - So simply highlight the project you are currently working on actively!
            
        - **View**
            
            is in the Action block on the main dashboard. This is where you can plan out your week, move tasks between days easily, and do time-boxing to create a weekly schedule.
            
            It contains:
            
            1. The **Weekly Cal View** toggle where you can view your tasks for the current week in calendar format and easily move tasks between do dates.
                - In this view tasks can be dragged between days. To add a different end date - simply drag the right side of the task box along the timeline.
                    
                    ![[BC_SC_Notion_05.04.2023_0017772x.png]]
                    
            2. The **To Do List** view where you can view your task list grouped by date. Click on the ... (three dots) and select 'Properties' to alter what shows up for each task if you wish.
                
                ![[BC_SC_Notion_05.04.2023_0018242x.png]]
                
                - _When tasks have a ‘Do on’ Date for this week they will show in toggles for Today and Next 7 Days. When you have live tasks for the week it should look like this:_
                - _Overdue Tasks will then create toggles above with Yesterday or ‘December 2021’ etc until you clear or move those tasks._
                - _There is a second view in the database called Weekly Board View - just click on the top left drop down menu to select it..._
            3. The **All Single Tasks** view listing all sub-tasks, or tasks without sub-tasks individually. Best for sorting everything by due date.
            4. The **Delegated** view showing delegated tasks: it is filtered where Assignee does not contain ‘me’ - so it works for any user.
                
                ![[LifeOSGuide_Delegated_Task_View.gif]]
                
                  
                
            5. The **Task Timeline and Dependencies** view showing your tasks and sub-tasks in order of doing. Joining them up creates dependencies - (what tasks are blocking or blocked by others) See dependencies for more.
                
                ![[LifeOS_Guide_Dependenices_Demo_Timeline.gif]]
                
            6. The **Recurring Tasks** view showing tasks created by and assigned with the Recurring Task template. This is filtered by the Status Tag ‘Recurring Today’ - which is automatically added when you use the Recurring Task Template.
            
              
            
        - **View**
            
            This is simply a view of your tasks filtered where they have a deadline set. If you don’t set a deadline they will not turn up here
            
            not all tasks have deadlines: I like to just use this for essential - time specific hard deadlines to make sure I’m, good… Like launching this template!
            
        - [[My Calendars 2]]
            
            This a monthly calendar view of your tasks by Do Date.
            
            It is also a place you can set up multiple tasks if you want to easily pre-populate the calendar with multiple tasks (the form of recurring tasks Notion at the time of writing this guide doesn’t yet support) See recurring tasks above for more info and how to do it + this video is useful for the old method.

    - **Set Up The View**
        
        This can be viewed on the home page and the [[Do Today Action View 2]]
        
        Notion still doesn’t have a proper calendar integration. But you can work around this: the my favourite go-to option which I still use is the simplest. install a widget of your Google Calendar using Indify.co. It’s super easy.
        
        1. You’ll see a place holder image of my calendar on the view - delete this first
        2. Insert your own [Indify.co](http://indify.co) Calendar Widget: Connect Google Calendar using the instructions on Indify. I use two copes of it, one set to month and one set to day view.
        3. Create the Calendar, copy the link and paste it in this section as an embed.
        4. Whilst you can’t edit the widget: you can simply copy a web link to your Google Calendar above and jump to Google to do so: easy and still my fav.

### Simon’s Life OS Build Along Process (videos available soon)

Notion Life OS Update Along Videos: these will be coming ASAP around when the final version is released! Green has been filmed.

==**Video 1: Introduction to the Build Along**==

==**Video 2: Homepage Navigation Done**==

==**Video 3: Wider Navigation Done**==

- ==**Videos 4, 5 & 6. New Build Insert: Habits, Fitness, Journal, Goal Setting & Years: Adding My Replacement Section Done**==
    
    The two areas I recommend moving fresh into the workspace are essentially - all the trackers: Goals, Habits, Fitness and in a separate process - Finance Tracker. In the next videos of this build along we will update Projects, Tasks, Areas, and Knowledge and Notes - since these are areas I would expect existing users wanting to keep existing databases: but it was the habit tracking system I think i really made too complex last time!
    
    1. Disconnect the existing Years, Journal, Habits, Goals, Fitness Tracker and Days database relations and then deleted them / or for now mark as OLD. These will be replaced
    2. Drop the whole stand alone template into the Tracker and rename the dashboard To Tracker.
    3. Next I need to consolidate the System databases, by first moving all the master pages to the main Life OS dashboard / or we have the option to keep these as part of this tracking Section of the Template
    4. We can also use this time to reformat all system databases on to one page like my Simplified Life OS
    5. Clean up the views and replace the old Goals Database views on the home page
    6. Next i want to update all the buttons on the homepage
    7. And I Will want to connect The Financial Year, and Projects to the Years Database and build out some better reports: But We’ll also be adding a new Financial Tracker to this system.
    8. Finally, we need to align the Fitness Tracker into the system
    9. Adding Charts
