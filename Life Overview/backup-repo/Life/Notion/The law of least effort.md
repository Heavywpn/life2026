==**It is human nature to follow the law of least effort, which states that when deciding between 2 similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work**==

  

==**Out of all the possible actions we could take, the one that is realized is the one that delivers the most value for the least effort. We are motivated to do what is easy**==

  

==**Every action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energy required, the less likely it is to occur.**==

  

==**In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers**==

  

==**This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it. If you can make your good habits more convenient, you’ll be more likely to follow through on them.**==

  

==**On the tough days, it’s crucial to have as many things working in your favor as possible so that you can overcome the challenges life naturally throws your way.**==

  

> ==**The less friction you face, the easier it is for your stronger self to emerge**==

  

==**The idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run**==

  

### How to achieve more with less effort

  

==**One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with your habits is to practice environment design**==

  

==**Environment design is a method for making cues more obvious, but you can also optimize your environment to make actions easier**==

  

==**Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life**==

  

==**Addition by subtraction:**== ==**The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones**==

  

### Prime the environment for future use

  

==**The purpose of resetting each room is not simply to clean up after the last action, but to prepare for the next action**==

  

==**Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to make the next action easy**==

  

==**These are simple ways to make the good habit the path of least resistance**==

  

==**You can also invert this principle and prime the environment to make bad behaviours difficult**==

  

==**The greater the friction, the less likely the habit**==

  

==**It is remarkable how little friction is required to prevent unwanted behaviour**==

  

==**These tricks are unlikely to curb a true addiction, but for many of us, a little bit of friction can be the difference between sticking with a good habit or sliding into a bad one**==

  

==**Imagine the cumulative impact of making dozens of these changes and living in an environment designed to make the good behaviours easier and the bad behaviours harder**==

  

==**How can we design a world where it’s easy to do what’s right?**==

  

==**Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do**==
