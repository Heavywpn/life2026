(it's safe)# https://www.youtube.com/watch/ey4u7OUAF3c00:00:00.090 In this video we're going to exposeyour home network to the internet.00:00:04.440 Now don't be scary.00:00:05.280 This is completely secure and kind ofcrazy actually cuz we're not punching00:00:09.520 holes through your firewall,00:00:10.520 which is what you might do with areverse proxy like engine X or traffic00:00:13.560 forwarding and exposing ports 80and 4 43. Now we're not doing that.00:00:17.760 Instead we're creating a tunnel.00:00:19.440 And with this tunnel we cansecurely expose anythingon your home network to the00:00:24.640 internet, a website, prox,walk Porter, anything.00:00:27.800 And I'm telling you this is nuts.00:00:29.320 Everything you expose will haveits own sub-domain and SSL cert.00:00:33.560 Even if you only have a ACTTP or a self-signed cert,00:00:36.560 we're setting up CloudFlare Tunnel afree service that allows you to connect00:00:40.360 securely to your home networkresources from anywhere.00:00:43.200 And it doesn't matter whatkind of home network you have,00:00:45.320 I know some of you your is P sucks andyou got CG nat and all that doesn't00:00:49.600 matter, this will work. Settingthis up is super simple.00:00:52.280 It'll only take a few sip ofcoffee. Here's what you need.00:00:55.710 Coffee being one of those things.First you will need a domain name.00:00:58.560 I'm gonna set up one realquick with Google http://domains.it/'s about 12 bucks a year.00:01:01.800 It's just the cost ofdoing business. Second,00:01:03.640 you'll need a computer or server insideyour home network and this can be00:01:07.640 running pretty much any OS and um,I think you might have one, right?00:01:10.640 And it's on this computer or server thatwill install CloudFlare Tunnel and then00:01:14.560 it will tunnel out to CloudFlare andit's through that tunnel that we can tell00:01:17.720 CloudFlare to route pretty much anysub-domain to anything inside our home00:01:21.960 network, SSL cert and all. And yeah,that's pretty much all you need.00:01:24.920 Let's get our coffee and getstarted. But before we get started,00:01:27.560 I wanna talk about this,00:01:28.740 the computer or server that you're usingin your home network. And like I said,00:01:32.400 anything will work.00:01:33.100 But I want you to try and start usingRed Hat Enterprise Linux or Rel Rel.00:01:37.560 Rel Rel Red Hat is the sponsor of thisvideo making this video happen And I've00:01:41.760 recently started using Red Hat Enterpriselinnux and My Home Network. But why?00:01:46.220 Two reasons. Number one,00:01:47.520 red Hat Enterprise linnux is the flavorof linnux at enterprise companies use.00:01:51.520 You know the big companiesthat you may want to work for,00:01:53.960 they use the stuff and for a lot ofreasons, reliable, secure, standardized.00:01:57.840 It's the gold standard if youwant to run Lennox professionally,00:02:00.640 enterprise Lee in your network.00:02:03.220 But it's also not free usually.00:02:05.870 I've got a little surprisefor you here in a bit.00:02:07.640 Now getting back to the point 0.1 thatit's used by enterprise companies.00:02:11.000 Why do you care?00:02:11.870 Well for me the point of having a homelab doing all the stuff in my crazy00:02:15.640 office is to get hands on experiencewith enterprise IT stuff so I can learn00:02:19.640 skills that make me more valuable.00:02:20.880 So a company might hire me to dothe stuff I'm doing in my house.00:02:23.650 So it just makes sense if companiesare using Red Hat Enterprise Linux,00:02:27.120 the companies that may hire you one day,00:02:29.050 it makes sense to put thatinside your home network,00:02:31.240 inside your home laband learn how to use it.00:02:34.050 So maybe you can put on your resume,Hey I run this stuff at home now.00:02:37.560 Number two, why you might want to useit, why you should use it right now.00:02:40.040 If you're a company it's not free, butif you're you an individual, a person,00:02:45.070 make sure you check that I'm not a robotthing. Do a puzzle. Okay, you're good.00:02:48.560 You can sign up for Red Hat'sdeveloper for individual subscription,00:02:51.880 which includes a free versionof Red Hat Enterprise Lennox,00:02:55.240 and not just a free version. You canactually license up to 16 servers.00:02:58.680 And those servers can be asbeefy as you want them to be.00:03:01.240 So all you have to do right now ischeck my link in the description,00:03:03.600 get signed up and once you're loggedin you can check out your subscription.00:03:06.440 There's mine right here. I'veonly used one server so far.00:03:09.040 And to download your Red Hat EnterpriseLinux, go to downloads at the top Lyft,00:03:12.760 there it is right there.00:03:13.680 Click on the little icon here and saydownload latest and I'll grab that 9.100:03:17.680 right now. The one thing I love about Rel,00:03:19.560 that's how the cool kits say it is theyhave a web console for your server,00:03:23.080 which is a beautiful gooey that allowsme to manage pretty much everything about00:03:26.680 my server, including containersrunning on that thing.00:03:29.810 So if you wanna run your homelab like an enterprise company,00:03:32.280 check out Red HatEnterprise Linux link below.00:03:34.720 That's what I'm gonna use rightnow to set up my CloudFlare Tunnel.00:03:37.280 I'm gonna head out to Google Domainsby Googling domains. We're here.00:03:40.600 I would like to get a new domain soI'll click on that search for man,00:03:44.360 what should it be? Hey, it'savailable, I'll take it.00:03:48.890 Go to car, check out. Bye. RegisteringCoffee break and it's mine.00:03:53.480 Step two, set up a CloudFlare account.I'll head out to http://cloudflare.com/,00:03:57.520 click on sign up at the topright Elon mailto:musk@networkchuck.com00:04:02.600 password and create account.00:04:03.800 Make sure you check your emailand validate your email address.00:04:06.820 I'm gonna do that right now.00:04:07.980 And finally we can click on add site toadd a new site. It's what we want to do.00:04:12.400 Put in my new domain, Elon Musk http://homelab.com/. Add site. Uh, don't get scared,00:04:16.760 scroll down a bit, it is free.Just click on free right there.00:04:19.959 They try to hide it fromyou. Click continue.00:04:21.899 Now no matter what domainprovider you're using,00:04:23.960 you'll need to use CloudFlare asyour name servers. How do we do that?00:04:27.320 I'm gonna show you rightnow. So here on this page,00:04:29.280 I'm gonna scroll down justa bit and click continue.00:04:31.360 And right here on step four,our Cloudflare's name server,00:04:34.920 whatever you have there,you'll use both of these.00:04:36.320 So I'm gonna jump backover to Google Domains,00:04:38.120 click on DNS and using my eyeballs,00:04:40.840 I'm gonna try and find custom nameservers. There it is right there.00:04:44.070 I wanna change my nameServers to something custom.Here we go. Copy Clarissa.00:04:47.760 Clarissa explains it all.Copy Evan. Click on save.00:04:50.480 And then Google's kind of tricky.00:04:51.720 You have to click on switchto these settings at the top.00:04:53.680 Once you do that and we're done. Nowthis could take a moment. They say,00:04:56.320 oh it can take up the 24 http://hours.it/ rarely does. It might though,00:04:59.570 so like don't get mad at me. Mineusually takes like a few moments.00:05:03.250 So getting back to CloudFlare,00:05:04.440 I'll click on done check name serversand I'll click on finish later for this,00:05:07.480 I'll do it later and I'll click oncheck name servers once more. Come on,00:05:10.160 really check it now it should reflecthere and you'll also receive an email00:05:13.160 telling you, hey it http://happened.so/ we'll give that a moment.00:05:15.560 Coffee break and lookat that. Mine is done.00:05:17.720 Took a little less than five minutesso not too bad time for step three,00:05:21.160 set up our CloudFlare tunnelhere in CloudFlare land.00:05:24.240 We're gonna scroll down just a bit onthe side panel and click on zero trust00:05:27.880 because you can't trust anyone exceptfor me. You can trust me and your mom.00:05:31.480 That's about it. Now you should behere at the Zero Trust dashboard.00:05:34.160 You can do a lot with it.We only care about tunnels.00:05:36.370 So we're gonna go over here and clickon the access tab right there and then00:05:39.960 click on tunnels and we do have a bitmore setup. We'll click on complete setup.00:05:43.240 Yes, yes, yes, we know. Click on nextto name our team. Elon Musk Comb Lap.00:05:46.910 Next again, scary pagewhere you're like, Chuck,00:05:48.880 I thought you said this was free and itis. It's just over here. Hidden kind of.00:05:51.760 I want the free plan.00:05:52.520 I'm selecting that Proceed to paymentof zero while they have to use that00:05:55.560 language. Now even though it is $0,00:05:57.840 it still doesn't want a payment on filesimilar to AWS and but it shouldn't00:06:01.880 charge you anything cuzagain, zero is zero, right?00:06:04.240 So let's click on next and then clickon purchase for our $0 purchase. Okay,00:06:08.720 we're good. Now we canactually click on tunnels.00:06:10.970 So let's get back to access and tunnelsand let's create our first tunnel.00:06:14.400 This is so crazy. Click on Create tunnel.00:06:16.480 Let's name it ElonMusk's House Save tunnel.00:06:20.180 And this is stupid easy. I told you youcould pretty much install this anywhere.00:06:23.840 They have all the flavors. Myfavorite flavor is gonna be Docker,00:06:27.120 but whatever you got,00:06:28.150 just click on these guys andI'll have the code you can run.00:06:30.680 So I'll click on Docker and I'll copythis snippet of code right here and here00:06:34.040 on my Red Hat Enterprise Linux machinewith Docker installed. Let's make sure,00:06:38.140 yes, I'm going to paste that code,00:06:40.280 although I will make one change herewhen I control A to get my cursor to the00:06:43.360 very beginning and just after a run,00:06:45.000 I'm gonna add a dash D for Damon soit runs in the background and then hit00:06:49.040 enter. Done. It's running sun. Now I getback to my cloud flare dashboard here.00:06:53.080 I'll click on next and time to routemy first service. So check this out,00:06:56.760 I'll do my proxima server first. SoI'll do prox mos, select my domain,00:07:00.280 which I already have set up Elon muskhome http://lab.com/. I'll select my service type,00:07:04.120 which will be HTTPS S for prox max.00:07:06.960 And then the internal privateIP address to my prox max server00:07:10.260 10 77, 73 port 8,006.00:07:14.660 Now you can see that CloudFlare Tunnelis acting kind of as a reverse proxy,00:07:18.670 except it's not exposing your homenetwork to the big bad internet.00:07:22.920 Insecurely unsecurely. It's safe.00:07:25.120 Now for services like Prox mos thathave self science certificates,00:07:28.110 I wanna click on additionalapplication settings.00:07:30.360 And under TLS I can say no TLSVerify. So it'll be okay with that.00:07:35.040 Then click on save Elon Musk'shouse tunnel and boom. So right now,00:07:39.000 a bunch of cool things happening.First, my tunnel is active.00:07:42.040 That means that whatever I did onmy Red Hat enterprise Lennox server,00:07:44.590 it's working. We're connected. I didn'thave to do anything to my firewall.00:07:47.950 I didn't have to really do much copy andpaste. You can do that. I can do that.00:07:52.200 It's awesome. Okay, anyways,so let's test it out.00:07:55.040 I'm gonna navigate out tocrocs mos dot elon musk home00:07:59.360 http://lab.com/ and it, it's working ,00:08:03.980 how cool is that? I'm logged in. Let'stry a connection from the outside.00:08:07.120 I'm gonna launch my chasm workspacehere, which is hosted in LE node.00:08:10.400 Open up a brave browser,00:08:11.600 which is outside my home network andI'll do the same thing I'm in and all the00:08:15.440 products mock stuff worksflawlessly. Check this out.00:08:17.800 One thing that doesn't work great withEngine X and traffic without a lot of00:08:22.680 work is the console. It works greathere. Now looking back at CloudFlare,00:08:26.400 all we need is that one tunnel foreverything. So if I click on configure,00:08:29.910 I can add more public hostnames. Let's add another one.00:08:32.720 Let's add my Sonology nass.00:08:34.159 So I'll just do NASS elonmusk home http://lab.com/ type HTS URL00:08:39.289 on port 5,001. I'll make surethere's no TLS Verify save host name.00:08:43.679 Let's test it out. Nas dot elon musk http://homelab.com/ and look at that . How,00:08:47.760 how easy was that?00:08:48.990 I don't have to worry about let's encryptcertificates or really just anything.00:08:53.170 It just, it just works. And there's thatbeautiful SSL shirt right there, man.00:08:57.960 Now you gotta admit that's the easiestway you've seen to expose your home00:09:02.000 network's resources tothe internet. I mean,00:09:04.040 just a few clicks and you can host yourown website on a raspberry pie inside00:09:07.720 your house no matter whattype of network you have,00:09:09.660 and people can securely access it.CloudFlare is changing the game.00:09:12.900 Let me know if you, um, hacked to YouTubetoday that like boat notification,00:09:16.640 bell comment, subscribe. You gotta hackYouTube today ethically, of course.00:09:19.960 And for real, just let me know belowif you did this and how cool it is.00:09:23.680 I just wanna, I wanna geek out with you,so get some coffee and let's geek out."
