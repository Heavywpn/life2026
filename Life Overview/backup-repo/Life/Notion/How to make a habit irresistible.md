  

### The Dopamine-Driven Feedback Loop

  

==**Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop**==

  

==**Every behaviour that is highly habit forming is associated with higher levels of dopamine**==

  

==**Dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it**==

  

==**Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act**==

  

==**It is the anticipation of a reward, not the fulfilment of it, that gets us to take action**==

==**Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them**==

  

==**Desire is the engine that drives behaviour**==

  

==**Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response**==

  

==**We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling comes into play**==

  

### How to use temptation bundling to make your habits more attractive

  

==**Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do**==

  

==**You’re more likely to find a behaviour attractive if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time**==

  

==**More probable behaviours will reinforce less probable behaviours**==

  

==**The habits stacking + temptation bundling formula:**==

1. ==**After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]**==
2. ==**After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT]**==

  

> ==**Doing the thing you need to do means you get to do the thing you want to do**==

  

==**Temptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want. Engineering a truly irresistible habit is a hard task, but this simple strategy can be employed to make nearly any habit more attractive than it would be otherwise**==
