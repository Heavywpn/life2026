==**People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are**==

  

==**Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you**==

  

==**Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behaviour**==

  

==**Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviours tend to arise again and again under certain environmental conditions**==

  

==**Every habit is context dependent**==

  

==**Behaviour is a function of the Person in their Environment, B =**== _==**f**==_ ==**(P,E)**==

  

==**The truth is that many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option**==

  

==**You don’t have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it**==

  

### How to design your environment for success

  

==**Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Unfortunately, the environments where we live and work often make it easy not to do certain actions because there is no obvious cue to trigger the behaviour**==

  

==**When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore**==

  

==**By comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention toward a desired habit**==

  

==**If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment**==

  

==**The most persistent behaviours usually have multiple cues**==

  

==**By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cues for good habits are right in front of you.**==

  

==**Most people live in a world others have created for them.**==

  

==**Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life**==

  

> ==**Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it**==

  

### The context is the cue

  

==**The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour**==

  

==**We mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur. Each location develops a connection to certain habits and routines.**==

  

==**Our behaviour is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them**==

  

==**Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships**==

  

==**Habits can be easier to change in a new environment**==

  

==**It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habit**==

  

==**It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues**==

  

==**When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one**==

  

==**Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits**==

  

==**If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones**==

  

==**Every habit should have a home**==

  

==**Habits thrive under predictable circumstances like these**==

  

==**If you want behaviours that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable**==

  

==**A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form**==
