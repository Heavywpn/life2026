    - What is P.A.R.A?
        
        The PARA dashboard offers filtered views of the rest of the Life OS database network to allow you to view your information in the format of Tiago Forte’s PARA productivity system.
        
        The notable addition here is the Areas view - where you can sort your materials into Chosen Areas using a Relation in the rest of the system.
        
        **Everything can be related to everything else - so use it how you wish to create connections and outputs!**
        
          
        
        What is P.A.R.A.?
        
        The P.A.R.A. method is a productivity system created by author and entrepreneur Tiago Forte. P.A.R.A. stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives - they move from _more actionable_ to _less actionable_
        
        - **Projects** refer to the specific tasks or goals that you are currently working on, or more specifically
            
            A **project** is “a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.”
            
        - **Areas** represent the different areas of your life that you want to manage, such as personal, work, or health - or more specifically
            
            the **areas of responsibility:** “a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.”
            
        - **Resources** are the tools, information, and people that you need to accomplish your projects and goals - or more specifically
            
            A **resource** is “a topic or theme of ongoing interest.”
            
        - **Archives** refer to “inactive items from the other three categories” information and materials you have already completed or are no longer relevant but may still hold value for future reference.
        
        The P.A.R.A. method helps you organize your digital and physical spaces by separating them into these four categories. By doing so, it allows you to focus your attention on what you need to accomplish and find what you need quickly and easily.
        
        To use this method, you can create separate digital and physical folders or notebooks for each of the four categories, and then sort your tasks, notes, and resources into the appropriate folder. You can also review and update your system regularly to ensure that everything is up-to-date and organized.
        
          
        
    - **Dashboard Overview**
        
        The PARA Dashboard is a top level reference page to organise and see your information within certain filters. Watch the chapter of the Life OS Guide Video for a Full overview.
        
        - Projects are simply a view of your [[Projects 2]] for easy reference.
        - Areas & Resources are separate views but served by the same
        - Create a New Area or Resource by choosing a template and you’ll see it turn up in the relevant dashboard
            
            ![[LifeOS_Guide_Areas__Resources.gif]]
            
        - The Page for each Area of Resource of show filtered views of anything related to it. Resources can also be linked to Areas so you can have grouped information referenced to an Area.Here’s an example of an Area Page:
            
            ![[BC_SC_Notion_05.04.2023_0017872x.png]]
            
        - Area Pages show filter views of related:
            - Projects
            - Resources
            - Notes
            - Clippings & Knowledge
            - Journal Entries
            - Contacts
        - Resource Pages show filter views of related:
            - Notes
            - Clippings & Knowledge
    - **Areas & Resources:** What is the difference?
        
        These two dashboards are simply ‘_filtered containers’_ - to link your other information databases too to organise your information. They don’t actually have their own content, other than these relations.
        
        **Areas** are the main _areas of your life_ (e.g. Family, Health, Travel, Finances). These are important parts of your life and work that require ongoing attention. These rarely change.
        
        **Resources** are _a range of topics & material_s that you are interested in and want to learn about. These may change more frequently than Areas.
        
        but can be linked with each other with a self referencing relation. Simply put - if you want to add something to an area or resource for future reference from an other dashboard, select it in the Area/Resource Relation and you’ll see it there.
        
        You can have Resources related to Areas in your life and vice versa (for example, Local Schools related to Family), but you may also have a Resource that is not related to any Area (e.g. Breeds of dog to consider as a pet) or an Area without a Resource (e.g. Spirituality) as well.
        
    - **Your Archives**
        
        Archives are all items you no longer need to see, but want to keep… just in case. The Archive view is simply a **linked, filtered view of all your databases** - just filtered the opposite way to the dashboard views - to only show something that has been marked as Archived!
        
        ![[LifeOS_Archives.gif]]
        
        Instead of having these items clutter your everyday and reference lists or deleting them, you mark them as archived. You may never reference these items again, or it could be that you may need the info here one day for a project you are now working on.
