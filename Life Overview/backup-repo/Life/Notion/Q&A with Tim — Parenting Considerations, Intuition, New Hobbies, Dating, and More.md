Transcipt: Start0:00[Music]Welcome. And thank you.0:14first and foremost thanks everybody I really appreciate all the hosting and0:20amazing celebrations and going on around the world it was0:26super fun for me to be part of and to watch and to participate in so thank you0:31very much for all of that and what I thought we would do is bounce back and0:38forth between these questions here and I'll0:44I'll do improv jav as improv jav improv Jazz as we go through and I'll pick some0:51questions and then we will also do some live questions so why don't we start with some live0:58questions I'll hop in here and I'll answer as many questions as I can that were presubmit as well RJ from Malaga1:07Spain believe it or not I have some ancestors from Malaga Spain one of them was killed in a bull fight so be careful1:14with the bull fights all right if you had to pick a topic for your podcast that I'd stick to from now on topic orA focus on reinvention.1:21theme would you pick probably reinvention of different types I think I1:27would focus on people who have reinvented themselves instead of sticking with the tried and true Groove1:32people who have taken the time or the space or just the attention to step back1:39and reexamine their assumptions reexamine the things that have worked up to this point that may not be those1:46things directionally that they want to continue pursuing so reinvention I think Kate and Cody how do you think aboutOptimization.1:52over optimization uh today many of us have the resources to enable us to spend1:57countless percentage of our life tweaking and attempting to op optimize every little thing I would say that you2:03want to pick very carefully what you choose to optimize as a very dear friend of mine I won't mention him by name2:09because you might not like that but very top 1% of 1% in terms of performer put2:15it to me he's like you want to be incredibly excellent the best you can be2:20in one or two things and then for everything else it's good enough passing grade for everything else2:26and he walks that walk and got a great family he's a great husband and father2:33he's very good at the things he chooses to optimize and for the rest he's notRecent joy.2:39worried Claudine what has brought me a ton of Joy or fun recently archery I've2:44been doing a lot of archery training not sure if you can see my forearms they are all screwed up I was shooting both right2:51and left-handed but find that incredibly uh joyful and meditative all right Joel2:57Hello Joel our group had so much in common it was so fun everyone wants to stay connected they asked if there might be more opportunities for me to3:02facilitate keeping us connected in the future the greatest joy that I got from the parties for the 10th anniversary and3:09so on was how many people came together with some shared interests or Curiosities at least who then wanted to3:17hang out after the event people who wanted to stay connected that made me super super happy that was really The3:24Not So secret agenda all along so that made me really happy and I'd like to explore ways that I can facilitate that3:30without having to manage it myself Cindy has a question [ __ ] punch update pleaseA CØCKPUNCH update.3:36yes I have a ton of artwork and a lot of material to share with respect to World3:42building and frankly I've let Perfection be the enemy of good I've wanted to3:48present all this stuff in this high production value video with all the3:53bells and whistles and I've been sitting on this stuff for many months now and uh3:59I think that is my perfectionism getting in the way of Simply sharing these things so I have lots of stuff to share4:08and I need to get on that I would say in the next few weeks doesn't need to be fancy I feel at this point Expediting is4:15more important than optimizing delivery all right oh God worst funniest date I've4:21been on yeah we'll need another live chat to cover that Arena how am I todayHow the day’s going so far.4:27I'm doing really well uh beautiful day here it's a little warm I don't handle heat terribly well I'm going to go shoot4:32arrows after this Q&A and hang out with Molly outside I'll have her behind the4:38line of fire she's a very good archery dog in that way and uh a little tired4:43I'm not sure why I might have a fever I've been training really hard so who knows maybe there's a bug in the food or4:49something I've been very tired today it's unclear why cuz I got plenty of sleep um so that's how I am today but4:55happy to be doing the Q&A this is from Andre Andy from bu say what place doesArgentina affection.5:01Argentina occupy in my heart today and why well I have deep affection for Argentina and the RGS and I would like5:08to get back down there honestly I recently for the first time in 20 years basically went to a Tango Festival in5:16Austin so I bought new shoes I didn't even have shoes I haven't done Tango in ages and I've forgotten 99% of it which5:23is very painful for me but had a blast just had so much fun there's nothing like it so I think at some point it's5:30possible I'll go back to Argentina and do 3 to four weeks full immersion tons of Tango lots of steak and probably lots5:38of malbeck at the same time uh so I would say I'm I'm very eager to get down5:44there revisit it learn of the current events and leadership in particular in5:49Argentina which I find very interesting and we'll go from there what type of business/ investment is the mostIntriguing investments.5:56exciting for me right now anything that is aligned I'd say and this isn't an invitation for pitches but anything6:02that's really aligned with my the sort of ethos that I might6:09be looking to incorporate more in my life so for instance Maui neie venison from an ecological perspective from a6:16Founder perspective husband and wife team incredibly high integrity beautiful6:22family beautiful people and also very good operators it's a good business but6:27it's also doing a lot for or the sort of native ecosystem in Hawaii so that'd be6:35an example of something that's I feel very aligned with even though it's not the kind of tech multiples that we would be used to in potential outcomes6:42something I feel very good about also very involved with quite a bit of climate work and let's just call it6:48technology intended to help with many of the extreme weather and climate6:54challenges that we're going to continue to face top three snacks I'm eating right nowTop three snacks.7:00yeah I mean I have Maui Nei right around the corner so the Maui Nei venison sticks and then often it's it's some7:06type of mixed nuts minus peanuts and let's say cans of lentils so boring7:14but I find that very helpful there are a number of questions about AI I would sayAI thoughts.7:19I largely feel unqualified to have strong opinions about this but if I7:26invest and I've invested in one or two AI SP focused7:31companies they're very Niche and they have some type of at least intermediate7:38term defensible mode a lot of the AI stuff that's trained on publicly7:44available data is just going to get cloned as soon as it shows any traction and uh as some people may have noticed a7:51lot of stuff that was web 3 at one point those people have now pivoted into Ai7:56and I'm I'm trying to be cautious of anything that is kind of the investment8:02sector dour and there's still interesting things in web 3 although I think8:07blockchain is probably a better way to put it and they're very interesting things in AI but I like to invest in8:14what I know where I think I have an informational advantage and I do not think I have an informational Advantage8:20with AI question on on a few different things I'll pick two of these on Modern dating as a public figure how do youModern dating.8:26navigate the complexities of modern da I would say slowly and very carefully8:32what qualities do I look for in a partner to ensure a meaningful and sustainable relationship well first and foremost I would say the the smaller the8:39social media footprint the more comfortable I am but it also makes it very hard to find people if they're not online since it's not like I'm going out8:46to bars and just doing cold approaches so I would say uh8:52discretion someone who prefers a certain degree of privacy those are those are all indicators for me and in the8:59positive direction for trustworthiness I recognize a lot of people live online so that's just the9:05nature of our current day but I look for those things a demonstrated ability to9:11do hard things over longer periods of time I want to know that life isn't always hard for someone so if they're9:17able to focus on let's just say higher education for four years at a demanding9:24University that doesn't automatically make them a Super Genius who's perfect for me but it shows probably they're9:29able to focus on on certain things that are challenging for extended periods of time same thing if they've been at jobs9:35for at least some jobs for more than one or two years if it's constantly Lily Pad9:42hopping all over the place I don't find that to always mean someone is very9:49resilient when things get hard and things always get hard at some point so9:54those are a few then there's all the stuff you could guess you know beautiful feminine all that stuff uh but I would10:03say those are those are a few also someone who has an identity where they feel confident in having done hard10:10things that's the other benefit of I would say people who have done something objectively to the extent that10:17it's possible difficult is they have a certain confidence that helps the whole relationship right I feel like you need10:24to have a certain identity confidence in your own own ability and skills and selfhood10:32self-authoring before you can really be a good partner I think that's I think10:37that's the case as best I can tell but I'm I don't think I'm the last person10:42you would want relationship advice from but let's wait until I have it a little more figured out on self-experimentationSelf-experimentation to come.10:48you're known as using yourself as a guinea pig what are the next five things I'm planning to experiment with uh I'll10:54probably get back on look I I don't do as much crazy experimentation as I used to I am looking at some regenerative11:01medicine protocols uh possibly for helping inflammation and some of the lower back stuff which is greatly11:07improved since I started doing a few things but the jury is still out so I'm not going to get into that yet I don't want to make any prescriptive11:14recommendations until I've really tested things and uh archery training bunch of new types of archery training that I'm11:20excited to play around with and uh beyond that really a lot of it is just11:27putting in the work with things that I believe will be high leverage like working11:33on hips internal and external rotation and a few other things that I think11:38directly contribute to overall core and low11:44back functionality for lack of a better way to put it but nothing crazy in my11:50opinion uh some of the medical stuff people might think is crazy but it's it's pretty pretty solid research that's11:57backing this stuff you know 10 to 20 years of research search so I don't I don't feel like it's high risk what risks have I taken in the last 10 yearsAnalyzing the past decade’s risks.12:03that have really paid off are there any that did not pay off well you know the12:08podcast we could look at as a risk but risk for me is a very specific thing so12:14when people say this is risky this isn't risky I think definitions matter a lot for me risk is the potential of an12:22irreversible negative outcome very few things fall in that category so the podcast was very off the12:28beaten path for me but I didn't view it as risky because I could always stop doing it I could always just hit cancel12:35it was low cost to get started I enjoyed the process so the outcome wasn't the12:40only measure of success for me and uh that was quite a Divergence12:46that paid off certainly paid off I would say that I've made some good investment12:52calls and I've made some bad investment calls so the good ones fortunately make up more than make up for the the bad12:59ones but with let's just say web 3 as an example I went very heavy and hard into13:05a lot of web 3 and put money into a bunch of different funds and various things uh cockp punch as an nft project13:12was successful and I set expectations I think properly at the beginning uh if you go back and read that fq like I've13:18delivered on all of those and I'm going to deliver continually beyond that I have a lot more to share and everyone13:24else has run for the not everyone else but pretty much everyone else has run for the Hills and they're like forget13:29about all that no no forget about all that sleep sleep they don't want anybody to remember I don't mind at all because13:36I didn't I took all those proceeds and donated to the foundation the foundation Cay Foundation is going to do some13:42amazing work with the whatever it ended up being $2 million or something maybe a little bit13:47more so a lot of good will come of that and it was a huge creative Catalyst for13:54me and I think that without that I wouldn't be working on a new book14:00project right now as an example so it it checked all the boxes in terms of its objectives but as a sector I would say14:08uh took a took a lot of huge hits on that one and you live and learn you know I14:14wasn't playing with money I couldn't afford to lose but it was it was enough that it was very painful so there's an14:21experiment that didn't pan out but there's a reason they call them experiments and not14:27guarantees uh but yeah you got to choose your bet sizing properly so you don't put yourself in a bad situation all right so14:35that risks that it paid off that was from Rebecca Andre currently in a moment where IOutthinking a career bottleneck.14:40don't know what to do professionally have you had those moments yeah right now I'm not sure not sure what I want to14:46be when I grow up and uh some days it's really stressful to be honest which sounds silly I know but it is I like14:53having a plan I like executing to plan so the book is really the only14:58thing that is in my sights at the moment that uh looks clear otherwise what I'm15:06doing my best to do is try a lot of little things little experiments expose15:12myself to new people have couple of exploratory conversations a week or read15:19things listen to things I wouldn't usually read or listen to and have confidence because I've figured it out15:26multiple times in the past that I will figure it out again I don't need to fog myself unnecessarily I've yet to find15:33that helpful so that may not be super tactical at this point but that's that's15:40what I've been telling myself on my good days when I'm not beating the [ __ ] out of myself in my own head David what isMy current big project.15:45your current next project that I'm excited about how are you approaching it differently so this is I say the new15:53book I'm actually being much more collaborative with this book than I have in the past and that that's proving to15:59be a godsend because I have people to bounce things off of and to interact with it's just psychologically I think16:07much healthier at least at this point in my life than being a lone wolf on these16:12projects because Lone Wolf it's not a thing by the way like look at nature no Lone Wolf survives doesn't16:18work so I'm uh using that as a broad way to experiment and by the way [ __ ] punch16:25was a precursor to that because I worked really well with what you guys will see soon with the concept art and a lot of16:32the collaborative writing that was done and it was awesome it was a great process really had fun it wasn't just16:38locking myself in a cave like I'm in solitary confinement and that is what I'm trying16:45to emulate also in the uh writing of this new book so we'll see I mean I have16:52about four or 500 pages drafted so it's going to be it's going to be another big16:57one but you know that's what I do have you experimented with peptides IPeptides.17:03experimented with uh is it BMP 157 or bpc 157 like 12 years ago long time ago17:10so I am at a date with peptides but I did experiment way back in the17:16day but I really need to educate myself before I can have any thoughts on that17:21whatsoever and by the way just as a quick aside with anyone online if theyBe wary of high conviction.17:27only have high conviction statements if they really speak confidently all the time be very wary of those17:34people people who are being honest should say I have no [ __ ] idea all the time or they should say you know17:41what I'm not really sure I need to educate myself everyone online should have that17:46response a lot if they don't then you're not going to be able to separate out the real from the fake because they're saying everything with the same high17:52level of conviction be really careful about that what mindfulness practices do I use to prepare for high stakesPreparation for high-stakes presentations.17:58presentation or performances I would say I don't let18:05fear make me afraid in the sense that I I really remind myself if you weren't18:12nervous right then it would be a bigger problem it is normal to be nervous18:17before you go up like my hands are shaking a little bit I've done these things hundreds of times and I still get nervous I still get sweaty I still drink18:24too much Diet Coke or coffee or whatever beforehand as a ritual which just makes me more shaky obviously and it's like18:32it's okay it's fine like anyone who's going out to perform at a high level or attempting to do it at a high level is18:39going to be nervous so just use it like Mike Tyson would puke before he went on stage well on stage in the ring Dean18:45Martin used to puke before he went on stage I mean these These are legends right I'm not saying you want to emulate everything about them but these are18:51people who are at the top of their field so it's okay for them it's okay for you so I just remind myself of that and and18:59I will rehearse my ass off there's no mental trick you can do beforehand if you haven't prepared and for me the19:07preparation is the mindfulness practice I mean with my TED talk like I rehearsed19:12it so many times into voice memo on my phone walking around I mean hundreds of times so by the time I got to the day of19:20the presentation on the main stage of Ted I was like well I've put in the time19:26the deliberate practice I've done everything I can do so I am as prepared19:31as I will ever be so let it rip let's see what happens uh I'd say that's19:37that's the mindfulness practice I thought about doing content more geared at kidsKid stuff?19:43teens yeah I've thought about that I thought about it I'm not sure what the best venue is but I am going to be doing19:49some experimentation for students probably older students though kind of University or business schoolGetting the most out of a Tim Ferriss meetup.19:56level what am I looking to get out of the TF meetups and how can we help how can you help you know that was a20:03question so if some folks have asked like what question came up a lot some of the questions are just like hey how's it going because the interactions are so20:10short they're like hey how's it going um you know where you where are you where do you want to go and then we'd run out20:15of time but one of the questions was like how can we be helpful to you and my answer was and is now connect with20:23like-minded people do stuff in real life and this ties into AI it's like if if20:28you want to if you want to I think harness your20:36Humanity do stuff in real life like meet people man because the Poison's coming20:42in terms of information delus it's going to 10x in the next 10 to 18 months and20:48most minds and habits are not going to be ready for that I think it's20:54impossible to be ready but to be more resilient I would just say do more in real life like connect with like-minded21:00people try to do meetups you can do Zoom or something like that if you can't do21:06live but like really seek out your tribe and if those people happen to overlap with the people21:12who came to the meetups which was my hope then great like you just connected with a bunch of people who might21:21be of kind of similar similar tribe so I would say I would say do that will IIn-person conferences planned?21:27plan any iners some conferences I don't have any plans right this moment um Joel I see your note on IBS I don't have aIBS relief.21:34lot of thoughts on IBS I apologize I just don't know much about it uh I mean you what you could do and I21:41don't know if this will work but I mean you could just use like metamol citrus cell beforehand I mean it does slow21:47gastric emptying and it does also reduce glycemic index so if you're going to eat a meal you know it's going to spike your21:52glycemic index side note you can take like five of these capsules with uh fiber just a slow things down so that21:59the release isn't as intense uh so but I'm not a doctor I try not to pretend to22:05be one on the internet but I I really don't know much about IBS unfortunately but I'm looking at22:13anti-inflammatory protocols that could have an effect on this type of issue but I haven't looked at it well22:19enough so I don't want to give you any opinions what are some of my heresies um I mean I think a heresy thatPersonal heresies.22:27I have is just I think a lot of what we try to do22:32in Modern Life is a very new experiment right so I think if we look back at22:38older societies and they're not all rose-colored right it's it's very22:44seductive to look back at indigenous group X Y or Z and say oh you know they had it all figured out they were in tune22:49with nature and it's like well if you go back you also very often even now see22:55domestic abuse and lots of alcoholism other issues so it's it's not ever perfect anywhere but I would say if we23:03look at what gives people meaning I think we've been LED astray23:08with a lot of kind of brainwashing and theory that doesn't map very well to23:17anthropological study or really just common behaviors that you see around the world that seem to have some durability23:24and Nasim Talib talks about this a lot so I would just say broadly thinking23:30that in a lot of ways individually just in terms of like rugged individualism23:36we've gone off track a bit and23:41that a lot of the I'd say common ways that we plan our careers and lives are23:48actually at odds with ultimately what's going to give us fulfillment I would say can unpack that more another time so aWhat makes conferences worthwhile for me?23:55couple people asking about conferences maybe maybe at some point I'll do a conference it would be quite small you24:00know it wouldn't be more than 200 people so if I ever did it it's a lot of work frankly and when I did it last time it24:09was basically not for profit because I spent so much money on the quality of the event so I don't know I'm I'm not24:16sure I have the energy to do it as a nonprofit and if it were not to be a nonprofit it would just be stupidly24:21expensive it would be like 30 grand a person or something obscene which I would feel kind of sillyLongevity and healthspan.24:28putting out there how realistic is it to consider the health span possibility RJ24:33to get to 150 years old in good health I'm not really sure how to evaluate this to be honest I I'm more focused these24:40days on experiential lifespan and trying to harness and I've spoken about this24:46before but trying to organize events Gatherings of24:53friends in some cases very intense physical experiences like long difficult24:58hikes or pilgrimage trails with people I really care for to basically pack a few25:05months into say a week at a time I think that's a reliable actionable way to extend your25:12experiential lifespan right to feel like you've basically packed 150 years into your let's say 85 uh most attempts at25:23extending longevity in any meaningful way have all failed to date right and maybe we are in25:29fact at this cusp of all these Amazing Discoveries that will lead us to live a really long time maybe that's Rapa maybe25:35that's some type of Tim restricted feeding maybe that is fall of Statin maybe it's who the [ __ ] knows you know25:43there's always something there's always some new ponon Fountain of Youth that25:48people have found especially on the internet I'm not super bullish on that stuff here's the thing I would say for25:55myself they're likely to fail so I would rather have low expectations and be pleasantly surprised later than to take26:03all of these things and suffer what will most definitely be significant side effects26:10that we haven't foreseen with a lot of this new stuff so like fall stat for instance like it basically cripples FSH and26:18animal models so it's like do you really want to be infertile uh can you reverse that after the fact like yeah great you26:24have eight pack and you look younger than you did 8 weeks ago but now your balls don't work so I'm not ready to26:31make that trade you know maybe after I have three or four kids sure but uh I would just be very careful with that26:37kind of stuff so 150 I mean if we're talking about that in the next you know26:44basically putting people on a Glide path that will land them there in the next 10 to 15 years I'm pretty skeptical I mean26:50especially with increases in environmental toxins and other issues that will besiege Humanity over the next26:5710 to 20 years certainly I mean more weather issues forc migrations all sorts of [ __ ] um I'm not dystopian about it27:06but I'm not it should tell you something that I'm not about my personal beliefs at27:12least that I'm not doing a lot of that stuff yeah I mean if you account for infant mortality and antibiotics and27:19then you look at say my entire family history on both sides it's like yeah males tend to die around 85 that's just27:25the way it goes so I would love to live longer but I'm not going to take a lot of27:31unnecessary risks where I see significant potential downside so long answer I'm interested in it for sure27:38like I track some of the science Andy Bruce any tips on walk in the Kumo cot though taking your 11-year-old son withTips for a father-and-son Kumano Kodo walk.27:44you that's cool that's fun uh there are a million different ways to walk this pilgrimage Trail in Japan which is the27:52sister Trail of the commo de Santiago in Europe there's the only two27:58world heritage pilgrimage Trails so there are like a thousand different ways you can do the kumoko it's like a28:05tributaries that then filter down to the main Shrine and Temple because they28:12basically took like Shinto mapping and then put Buddhism on top of it I would28:17pick one that crosses rivers and water if you can that's just really Pleasant feature when you're hauling ass and28:24getting really sweaty and so on bring walking sticks for sure like poles28:31especially for the downhill you'll be walking on Rock a lot it's very hard on the joints so nice thick heels you know28:39hoca shoes or something like that I would suggest like you will feel it in28:44your ankles and your knees and uh you know my thought is if you're going to do something longer because some people28:51will do like a week at a time or 10 days at a time you could spend months on the K codo is do a little bit less than you28:59think you can each day like don't push it super hard because you may be then handicapped the next day if your knee29:04really bothers you you're not going to you're not going to want to put a lot of weight on that for the next 1029:10kilometers or 20 kilom right so I'd do a little bit less than you think you can each day something about the Tweet ofA barbell distribution approach to life.29:17the kettle B swings is King of the exercise where else can you find the king of X could be relationships Finance29:22anything I think you I think a lot about barbell approaches to life so for29:28instance like highrisk Angel Investing and then like mun bonds as boring and as stable as you get right so it's kind of29:34one or the other like highrisk high return with small amounts of money or29:40very stable predictable boring and not playing in the middle as soon as you start playing29:46in the middle you're like I'm going to play with tech growth stocks da da and then you at least in my experience29:52that's how you get your face ripped off or that's how I get I get my face ripped off so I think about barbell distributions a lot in physical Fitness29:58and finance and everywhere aside from Richard Fineman if I could bring back one person from the dead for a podcastWho would I resurrect for a podcast interview?30:05episode who would it be oh man there's so many right I'm tempted to say like Marcus Aurelius or something but Sena30:13who knows I mean probably senica because I've just read so much of his stuff and I'm curious if I would find the guy to be an arrogant prick or what the vibe30:21would be in person right assuming we're speaking the same language I would be super curious about senica he gets a30:27very mixed review but I mean I'm once again listening to an audio book uh on anger or Ona30:34Ira I mean his writing is amazing the guy's writing is amazing but what would he be like in person would I be like oh30:41yeah this is the uncle who talks too much God this guy's longwinded maybe Ben Franklin I'd be interested very30:47interested in um those are a few that come to mind I mean I I could come up with 100 more for sure but those are30:54those are two off the top of my head do I have any mentors that I contact regularly for Life advice this is fromDo I consult any mentors regularly?30:59Jeff I found in midlife that I really missed out on having fatherly mentors in my 20s and 30s yeah there are I talked31:05to uh one this morning in fact he's uh early 70s very31:11healthy really takes care of himself great marriage close to his kids and I think he has grandkids now and so we did31:18a check-in for about an hour today caught up and this is a good reminder for me to do31:25that more often so I do feel I do feel good good about that Paula what are myAyahuasca and antidepressants.31:30thoughts on iasa on anti-depressants you've been doing iwaska for 13 years only just started taking anti-depressants unsure if I31:37should mix both this is from Brazil you need to be very very very careful so IA31:44plus certain anti-depressants like ssris can cause a potentially fatal serotonin31:49syndrome so you need to be very very very careful with that so I would31:55absolutely speak with doctors about that I not mix them until you get the go ahead from doctors and I I imagine a32:02psychiatrist who prescribe the anti-depressants I'd be very careful with that iasa is one of the one of the32:08riskier compounds at least of the let's call it classically known psychedelics with respect to combining32:14with anti-depressants so I'd be very careful with that and side note I learned not too long ago that people who32:21were taking Lithium should really not screw around with psychedelics a lot of Adverse Events32:27been reported at least with some of the classical let's just call it not not entirely tryptamine but LSD32:35psilocybin Etc so if you're taking higher doses of of lithium now there's some there are some ways that could be32:43conflated because of people are taking lithium what are they taking it for they might be taking it for any number of conditions that would be contraindicated32:48with psychedelics in the first place so who knows but uh I wouldn't mix lithium32:54with these things either how can you incentivize someone to Mentor you I'm not sure how to do that I mean I I thinkIncentivizing potential mentors.33:01you need to be a really good student number one he said no money possible I mean frankly I pay I pay for it a lot I33:08mean I have friends who learn from me and I learn from them and they're older than I am and I consider them33:14mentors but at the end of the day I actually find it in some ways cleaner to33:20just pay someone and uh if you wanted to get mentorship that isn't expensive like33:26maybe you go to Toastmaster or you join the EO like entrepreneurs organization33:32or YPO depends on what you're looking for but like mentors don't need to be expensive at all you know I have a33:38mentor in archery and he's also kind of a mental performance coach doesn't need33:43to break the bank so I would say you know you can go to your local YMCA and find a coach in some Sport and if33:50they're good at all at anything they will have life lessons for you especially if they're a bit older so I33:57would say that my advice for the moment do I babysit sometimes for some of my friends uh I mean not reallyAdventures in babysitting.34:04babysit but like I'll watch their kids for a little bit or watch a Disney movie with their kids like young kids uh how34:10did I find it I think I look I think I'm a kid at heart so for me animals and kids are I don't want to34:17say easy but especially if they're little I find them pretty easy I think34:24when if I have kids which is the Hope at least if they get to the point where they're like34:31petulant kind of like mean-spirited um kids where they're just34:37being [ __ ] I think I'll have a hard time with that I think I will have a hard time once they like know which buttons they're pushing and they're just34:43like drilling it in that I'm going to have trouble with but like little kids who just like are disregulated and lose34:49their [ __ ] because they haven't developed their prefrontal cortex like yeah like I can I can deal with that34:55pretty well my opinion of this is from JudyGLP-1 for depression/anxiety.35:00glp1 medications this would be like munaro or OIC uh glp want agonists believe they're35:08in clinical trials now for depression anxiety yeah I haven't looked at them specifically for that did put up a blog35:14post recently from Johan Hari on glp1 specifically so if you want to get some35:20of the science and also a firsthand report of that I would uh just go on tim. blog and search Johan J n n last35:28name Har h a r i all right so this piece of artwork you know people love this ICheap but choice art.35:34love it too I bought this for $80 at an antique Warehouse in the middle of35:40nowhere I saw it and I just loved it and grabbed it I love it every time I see it35:47maybe it was less 60 60 bucks 80 bucks at an antique Warehouse yeah it's one of35:52my favorite pieces of art that's a turkey tail below it a lot of turkeys around here35:59uh or not tail turkey feather for agents book agents and stuff uh last time IFinding a book agent.36:05checked which was a long time ago Publishers Marketplace is a great place to look also find books that are kind of36:10in the same category or vein as yours look at the acknowledgements and you'll very often see the agent there then you36:17can reach out to them directly through something like Publishers Marketplace or these days a lot of these agents or agencies have their own websitesMaking positive, in-person connections.36:23thoughts on how to approach making some great in-person connections yeah I would look at my talk I gave it South by Southwest which had the title how to36:31build a worldclass network in record time something click baity like that but it actually delivers uh I would check36:38that out all right this is from Dolan Dolan okay the last set was from Claudine thank you for those this one'sUnmentioned things I’d like to talk about.36:45from Dolan if I'm pronouncing that correctly basically anything that I would like to talk about that I haven't36:51had an opportunity to talk about yet for instance my interest SL journey in connecting with animals and nature maybe36:56some insights for my personal exploration of psychedelic and non-ordinary states of Consciousness over the last 10 years so I37:05have probably a thousand pages of notes on all this and at some point I feel37:11like that might be the most important book that I write but it's going to be it's going to be a lot to put it37:17together so in a way the book I'm doing now where I'm collaborating is sort of a possible warm-up for that because I I37:23don't think it's a book that I would want to do by myself it would just be such a heavy lift37:28and uh yeah we'll see we shall see but I37:34think if I if I talk about that at some huge length it'll probably be in a book I'd want to think about it because it'll37:40get so strange it will get so unbelievably strange number one first all the37:47scientific regulatory kind of on the radar above the line37:56logistical stuff that I want to handle in the Psychedelic Therapeutics world I want to handle first because if I ever38:03write this book it is going to get so weird that at least 20% of the people38:08who read it are going to think I'm completely insane it'll just be so strange I wouldn't want it to damage my38:16current credibility that I have to get things done in those worlds and U38:21including some of the stuff with animals man it gets I mean if you talk to people who've38:28like been in this stuff for let's just say culturally for38:33hundreds or thousands of years it's not weird but to most folks it's going to sound pretty [ __ ] weird which I get38:40excited about but I'm going to wait until I'm like you know what I don't give a [ __ ] what anyone thinks cuz it's not going to interrupt anything else38:46that I'm doing I don't care then maybe that book but it's going to be a little while this is fromIs there room for the irrational?38:51andrece all right so it's a it's a longer let's see here I'll paraphrase38:57here basically I'm very rational and methodical about decision-making and so on rational approach is admirable but39:04sometimes being a rational or spontaneous can inject a lot of energy and fun have I found space for39:09rationality to play a role in my life the irrational and emotional for decisions and if so have they ever led39:17me to alter my wellth thought out plans for the year so I would say yes I don't39:22know if IR rational it would be the word I would use Maybe because you have39:28like let's take moral I don't know what the proper word would be here but you have you have moral behaviors you have39:35immoral behaviors and let's just call those nonmoral behaviors then you have amoral behaviors that are kind of like39:42in this no man's land so I would say if you have like rational39:47rational irrational the opposite then there's like irrational I don't think that's a word but somewhere in the39:54middle where it's like it's it's not it's not driven by Logic it's driven39:59more by feeling I'm doing more and more of that these days for sure I mean our sort of40:07evolved system here with lots of valuable apparatus for navigating40:14reality predates Language by at least this kind of language by millions of years so uh40:22yes I found space for that although I'd be very careful about I see this quite a40:27bit in Austin and places like it where there's this like Neo new Agy stuff40:33where people are like I'm just using my intuition and I think very often that is40:39used for people used by people who just want a justification for doing what they want to do or doing something that is40:46easier than the hard thing and they're like well I'm just using my intuition right intuition is interesting to me40:51when it points you in a direction you didn't expect right where let just say40:57you go on a date and on paper they're perfect and you're like I'm going to love this person and then you meet them and you're41:03like something's a little weird here like I want to like them but this isn't right that's where intuition is valuable41:10right or like a business deal everything looks perfect and then there's something about it like uh my gut just doesn't41:16feel right that's where intuition is interesting if you're like this all looks perfect on paper and you know what41:23even though all my friends are telling me it's a terrible investment my intuition tells me to do it like that's where I'd be like well like wait a41:29minute here is this just confirmation bias what are my thoughts on blogging inBlogging in the age of AI.41:35the age of AI I mean look AI is amazing it's really incredible but writing for41:41me is a way of clarifying my own thinking and I do think that taking the time to craft words without the41:47assistance of AI is helpful I might use AI to get past the blank page but I41:52think it's seductive as a drug and just like most people people can't tell41:58Direction without Google Maps now I think it's it's very possible almost inevitable that people will lose certain42:05faculties that they currently have by overusing AI so uh we shall see but I42:12plan on doing more writing to the oldfashioned way I have not used binaural beats I am very interested inBinaural beats.42:20that and actually just reminded me somebody owes me something on binaural beats so if you have any recommendations42:28for what types of binaural beads let me know forour dog training yeah maybe4-Hour Dog Training?42:35Never Say Never best thousand I spent lately I mean it was more than that but on the archery training it's alwaysBest $1,000 spent lately.42:42something like that it's very rarely stuff I mean sometimes it's stuff like there's42:49a I bought an extra soite PSO RIT and a mini Rumble roller that I42:59can travel with and those have been amazing for just like rolling out my43:06glutes and per foris and my legs and stuff before bed really helps with sleep a lot but that's like I don't know 10043:14bucks 150 um I buy very well I try to buy very little stuff43:21it just ends up causing me more stress as clutter around my house than the value that it adds so so I try to get43:27rid of a lot of stuff good question of the was the last $1,000 worth of clutter43:32that gave me the most relief when I gave it away that's what I should think about am I aware of Javier M I think that'sJavier Milei.43:39how you say his name in Argentina I am I've actually listened to some of his speeches pretty interesting stuff I43:44don't know enough about them but a number of my friends are are big fans so need to do more research best thing thatBest thing I spent an “assload” on.43:51I spent an ass load on uh what's the best thing I spent an ass load on not to get too technical would be a family trip43:58I took my parents and brother and his wife on a trip around Europe and um that44:04was definitely an assload of cash but I think that was a good good investment and um I would recommend everyone read44:10something called The Tail End by Tim Urban that is a good investment of time44:16it's very short do I like painting not sketching as a hobby I haven't learnedPainting.44:21how to paint I would like to dabble in ideally watercolor I think think but do10–20 minutes on the acupuncture mat.44:28I have any quick tips for getting up to 10 to 20 minutes on the acupuncture mat yeah that's for people who are curious44:36the naoya ACU pressure mat I think or other there are a lot of imitations that44:42I'm sure just as just as good I don't go to 20 minutes typically but like 10 to44:4815 if I'm going to do it the first three minutes are going to be torer so you just have to get through the first like 3 to four minutes is my44:55experience otherwise I don't have I don't have much to tell you it can be it can be prettyDating apps.45:01intense thoughts on dating apps oh man this is like Warren Buffett covering his45:08eyes and like pointing towards Wall Street because half the people are going to have terrible experiences uh I don't know to be frank45:16I mean I I think hinge has been one of the better options so far I think that45:22in terms of just quality people have to pass some hurdles and add some information uh the league is pretty interesting also45:29because you can search by interest which is so critical I don't know why you can't do it on any other app but you can45:35search for like skiing or whatever to find somebody who has similar interests but the league is really only effective45:41in certain cities it's not used widely everywhere but like in a place like New York City or LA or whatever you could45:47find people who are pretty well educated interesting uh but a downside is people45:52tend not to use it that frequently so you might have a great match and they don't see your message for 6 months45:59so go figure it's a jungle out there folks be careful and there are a lot of46:04people catfishing so watch out for that too do a video call before you meet up with someone what's my favorite scienceFavorite sci-fi movies.46:11fiction movie and why big fan of the second Dune movie frankly uh ex bakina I46:17remember really enjoying there are a lot of great science fiction movies I think her was fantastic and you know at the time it seemed insane and it's basically46:25already there if you look at get the latest editions of chat GPT and so on46:30things like replica with a K replica uh yeah her is basically already here it's46:37pretty nuts with questions about [ __ ] punch it'll it'll be more interesting once I release the rest of the stuff or46:45a bunch of it then you'll have a lot more to chew on and I'll give you a foreshadowing it's not really a46:50foreshadowing it is a statement that I hope is a statement of fact and that is I will have some some fan writing46:57competitions like elimination competitions and so that47:02will reward people who really dig into the details they'll also have to be decent writing of course Claudine have IReflecting on the impact this show has had on others.47:11let the enormity of 10 years of TFS really land not just from a metrics POV but from a positive kindness deepening47:17Etc human level it's been such a Force for good and lighten this world thank you Claud and that's very kind of you to47:22say I would say that I I did47:27when the celebrations were happening but I could do a better job I could do a47:33better job of sitting with that so thank you for the reminder it's easy for me to47:39just like move on like yeah yeah good job but like you just did your job so don't get too happy with yourself and47:45like what's next what's next right like yeah you did your job and that's fine but like don't get too47:52smug about it or self-satisfied but I find that pretty that can be very self-defeating right so I did take time47:58to celebrate for the 10th anniversary and I had a great time the inperson meet up in Paris was great and it was really48:04fun to in person hear the stories from people who are deeply affected by the podcast so thank you for the reminder I48:11will I will um I will take a moment today to revisit that thank48:17you I should travel to meet girls well I mean why was I in Europe for 6 to8 weeksWhy was I in Europe for six to eight weeks?48:23uh who knows maybe it was related to that is it possible that my mood improved during this Q&A yeah it'sThe mood-altering effects of Q&A.48:29entirely possible I was exhausted guys I'm not going to lie at the beginning of this but I enjoy these interactions so48:36it is certainly possible that my mood improved as a function of my energy going up so thanks for that everybodyWhere do I see myself in 30 years?48:43where do I see myself in 30 years good Lord I don't know hopefully not six feet under we'll see I'll be 30 years I'll be48:5240 no 76 77 [ __ ] so I don't know48:57hopefully I'll be doing Black Diamond skiing because uh we found the Fountain of Youth have you suggested a workoutWorkout routines for older parents.49:04routine this is mags for my parents if not what would it potentially look like how would you approach it yeah I would49:10say super slow protocol look up Ken Hutchins and the super slow protocol and49:16uh yeah my dad's lost I don't know 80 lbs like let's call it 40 kilos in the last year so he's49:23made a lot of progress that's slow carb diet it's a straightforward from four our body and then super slow as applied49:32so super slow in in very basic terms is minimum 5 Seconds up 5 Seconds down so if you're doing a pressing movement five49:39seconds slow right up five seconds down one set one set to concentric49:46failure uh could be even slower could be 10 seconds up 10 seconds down but49:51especially in elderly quite effective for building muscle mass and increasing bone density without injury so that is49:59probably what I would I mean that's what I prescribed to my parents that plus walking to the extent50:06that it's possible Right Kind of barbell once again with slow carb diet is the glue that holds everything together howHow I walk and talk for podcasts.50:13do I record a podcast while walking this right here this50:22is atm50x it's an Audio Technica headset it's has50:29a USBC attachment plug that into your iPhone and then you can use Riverside or some other app there are a lot of50:36different ways to record this is from Mariana over the years I've followed and learned from youWould I consider becoming a single parent?50:41and your guest I've heard you say several times that I'm interested in parenting have you ever considered being a single parent family by choice I too50:46for many years was trying to find the perfect partner till I turned 41 and my doctor told me it was time to unfreeze my eggs since I was still single and50:52look for the partner decided my best option was to be a single parent so I got a non and ious donor and had my son50:57when I was 43 as I'm almost six now we travel the world together could not be happier with the drama-free life we have51:03just wishing to see you fulfill your parenting dream and wondered if I would consider this option too yeah I would consider it I would consider it you know51:10I think for a long time it was no but I would consider it I would I mean of51:16course ideally I would have the partner but I would consider it yeah it's not51:22off the table but I'm still fighting the fight getting back into the dating as51:29much as I'm just like [ __ ] this is this is a young man's game doing this online dating51:35[ __ ] uh frankly just the communications burden is so much G yeah51:42so anyway but to answer your question yeah it's on the table for me Joel I seeA $1 million coffee mug?51:47yours one of my big goals is to create the world's first coffee mug to sell for more than a million dollars I like that51:53I like that as a goal I don't really have a great recommendation for how to chip away at51:59it you could look at from a PR perspective at least people who52:04have you know sold pieces of the Brooklyn Bridge or sold hamburgers that are like52:10goldplated or like have have some type of of gold on them for like $300 at some52:17pizza joint right and the reason they're doing it is to get attention for everything else so what I would say is52:22you could think about selling a million doll coffee mug and make that your past fail or you could come up with a52:29compelling argument for why a coffee mug particular coffee mug should sell for a52:35million dollars and then use that as a PR hook to bring attention to everything else that you're doing which is probably52:42quite a bit easier but if you do that and someone buys it52:47great fantastic you did it you sold one for a million bucks now that said if that is the only52:55measure of pass fail then it's it's extremely binary but if you were to use it as a means by which53:01you draw attention to everything else that you're doing then I think it's pretty interesting so there you have it have IBrazil.53:08been to Brazil yes I've been to Brazil five or six or seven times actually all over the place in fact uh how big is myA small but mighty staff.53:15staff pretty small few people two three people four yeah something like that53:21three or four I guess at this point it's from Husain and Toronto after the 10 thAttracting event attendance.53:26anniversary I tried to organize a Fallout meeting however I had to cancel due to little interest I'll try again at the end of the summer can you think of a53:31cost-effective Tim Ferris way to make attendance at these events irresistible53:37well you might consider I'm just making this up so this is on the fly but you might consider partnering with another53:44organization like EO or YPO or whoever right who might be looking for53:50membership and you could say you know I'd love to host this type of event for fans of Tim Ferris or however you want53:56phrase it right listeners of the Tim far show or readers of such and such book and perhaps we can do an event54:04where they come for free get exposed to these following speakers I think having54:09speakers would be helpful so you could try to do that on your own or you could make it more of an54:17event right some type of activity so you could do I don't know Tim FIS show54:22paintball Extravaganza right get 10 people to go do paintball or something54:28who knows right you you have to make it like what are they what are they considering as Alternatives right it's54:34kind of like with Molly let's just say my dog Molly I remember at one54:40point I was working with this dog trainer and she saw me giving kibble to Molly as the treat just her regular dog54:47food but in little pieces and she goes what is that and I was like oh it's kibble she's like oh man she's like54:52you're not going to train your dog that way she said it's a crowded bar you got to TI with 20s she's like you're giving54:57her [ __ ] you have to have really good treats you have to tip with 20s it's a crowded bar right to compete with55:04the squirrels and the dogs and the other stuff the smells so I would say those55:09are a few ideas but if you have a small group of friends you could just you could just55:17take their temperature with a couple of different options and see how it goes right I mean uh those are a few initial55:24thoughts but maybe helpful maybe not Timothy Keen this is visualization orVisualization or affirmations?55:30affirmations I haven't used affirmations much to be honest I don't think actually that's not true with five55:37minute journal and things like that kind of these statements like I am or whatever I'll55:43also frequently have something like you have plenty of time or there is plenty of time right so that I don't feel55:51artificially rushed which never produces great results or great feelings for that matter55:57or something like frankly this is true for a lot of people on this Q&A right like you've already won the game you56:03speak English you have a computer hopefully you're healthy like56:09you've already won the game so just number one like take a breath realize56:14there's no game on some level left to win like you've already done it you've already crossed the finish line so56:19everything else is gravy so just like take a chill pill and breathe and then for visualiz ation you56:26know I use that mostly with athletic stuff uh sometimes if I'm going to get on stage for like a speak engagement56:32I'll visualize how it's going to go or I'll run through it visually like just like I have a VR headset on like I'll close my eyes I'm very visual so I'll56:38imagine the whole thing walking out sitting in the right chair looking to the audience how I'm going to hold the mic Etc and I'll run through some of56:45that as rehearsal let's say those are what come toToday I learned this about Hodinkee.56:51mind yeah check names I didn't realize that hinky was check for watches that's hilariousWhat would this look like if it were easy?56:58is uh yeah what would this look like if it were easy Cindy question that I still57:03ask myself all the time what do I like to ask my this is Victoria ask my fansWhat I ask show listeners when I meet them.57:09when I meet them I ask who they would like to hear on the podcast you if they could only pick one or two guests and they can't say Elon Musk or some huge57:15name no huge names allowed who would you like to have on the podcast that's that's a question I ask and I actually57:21have had a lot of those answers translate to guests on the podcast RandyEschewing endorsement remorse.57:26if we did a fan Meetup would you endorse it or say it's okay I mean this is where I have to be careful about taking on too57:32much uh responsibility with these things so probably not because if I did that57:38then anyone who's ever hosting a Meetup would come to me for the same thing and it would just create a huge comms problem for me and my my team so I'd57:45probably need to be hands off I don't think yeah I mean to have a fan meet57:51up I don't think you need my permission uh you know if you're turning into like some crazy business then using57:58my name then it turns into a separate thing do I like electronicMusic I like.58:03music yes I do I mean I'm pretty old school I mean I listen to shingo Nakamura quite a bit for like chill58:09mixes dead mouse pretty old school but I I wrote 4our body to a continuous mix58:15like a three-hour set of dead mouse there there's all sorts of stuff but58:20it's usually something that's going to give me a fair amount of energy I listen to like lowf beats type stuff when58:26writing sometimes if I need something a little downtempo for God knows where listen to a lot of58:34like heavy heavy metal when I'm writing oddly enough State story strategy yeah IState, story, strategy.58:39still use State story strategy people can look that up I got that from Tony Robbins I would consider having moreThe (not-so) funny thing about interviewing comedians.58:45comedians on the podcast but I feel like other people do a better job honestly you know like Rogan there's so many58:51comedy podcasts out there I want to differentiate myself in some way that feels authentic to58:57me category of one kind of stuff but yes Austin is now a comedy center it's59:03pretty wild all right you guys I think that's that's me for now I'm going to get outside and shoot some arrowsParting thoughts.59:10and I really appreciate everyone's time thank you for the hosting first and59:15foremost so awesome so fun to see all of these events around the world and
