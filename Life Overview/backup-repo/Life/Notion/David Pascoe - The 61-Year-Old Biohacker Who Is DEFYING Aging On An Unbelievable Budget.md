Here's a summary and analysis of the content:

SUMMARY:  
Ben Greenfield interviews David Pascoe, a 61-year-old biohacker defying aging through endurance sports, lifestyle changes, and longevity practices.

IDEAS:

- David Pascoe participates in marathons and mountain climbing for charity, particularly with World Vision
- Pascoe discovered his telomeres were shorter than expected at age 50, prompting lifestyle changes
- Stress from work, caregiving, and intense exercise contributed to Pascoe's shortened telomeres
- He reintroduced yoga, meditation, and rest days to improve his health and longevity
- Endurance sports may not be inherently healthy, but Pascoe continues for charitable causes
- The interview discusses the balance between fitness and internal health in endurance athletes
- Telomere testing can provide insights into biological age and stress impact
- The conversation explores the nuances of different types of exercise and their effects on longevity
- Pascoe began using telomerase activators after learning about their potential benefits
- The discussion touches on various ways to preserve DNA and inhibit telomere shortening

QUOTES:  
"David Pascoe, a 61-year-old biohacker, is defying aging on a budget through endurance sports, lifestyle changes, and longevity practices.""Biological age tests can reveal unexpected health issues despite outward fitness.""Balancing intense physical activity with stress-reducing practices is crucial for longevity.""Charitable causes can motivate individuals to pursue challenging physical feats.""Not all forms of exercise are equally beneficial for long-term health and aging.""Longevity practices can include a mix of lifestyle changes and targeted supplements."

FACTS:

- World Vision is an organization that works on clean water initiatives and child sponsorship in Africa
- Dr. James O'Keefe has raised concerns about the potential negative effects of excessive endurance exercise on health and aging
- Telomeres shorten with age every time a cell divides
- Stress from various sources, including intense exercise and caregiving, can contribute to shortened telomeres
- The benefits of endurance training may taper off at around 15 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week, according to some research

    P90X Summary:  
    P90X (Power 90 Extreme) is an intense home workout program designed to transform your body in 90 days. It combines various exercise styles including strength training, cardio, yoga, plyometrics, and stretching. The program follows a principle of "muscle confusion," which aims to prevent plateaus by constantly introducing new moves and routines.
    
    Here's a sample 6-day P90X workout schedule:
    
    |   |   |
    |---|---|
    |Day|Workout|
    |1|Chest and Back + Ab Ripper X|
    |2|Plyometrics|
    |3|Shoulders and Arms + Ab Ripper X|
    |4|Yoga X|
    |5|Legs and Back + Ab Ripper X|
    |6|Kenpo X|
    
    This schedule typically repeats weekly, with one rest day per week. The Ab Ripper X routine is often done after the main workout on strength training days. Each session usually lasts about 60-90 minutes, making P90X a time-intensive but comprehensive fitness program.

# Guidance

# ONE SENTENCE ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATION

Incorporate stress-reducing practices and balance your endurance training with recovery to optimize longevity and overall health.

# ANALYSIS

- Endurance sports may accelerate aging and cause inflammationScience: Excessive endurance exercise can lead to arterial stiffness, plaque buildup, and increased inflammation, potentially compromising longevity.
- Stress from multiple sources can significantly impact telomere lengthScience: Chronic stress, whether from work, caregiving, or intense exercise, can accelerate telomere shortening, a biomarker of cellular aging.
- Balancing intense training with recovery practices is crucialScience: Incorporating rest days, yoga, and meditation can help mitigate the negative effects of stress on telomeres and overall health.
- Outward fitness doesn't always correlate with internal healthScience: Being physically fit externally doesn't guarantee optimal internal health, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive health assessments.
- Charitable causes can motivate challenging physical pursuitsScience: Engaging in endurance activities for a greater cause can provide psychological benefits, potentially offsetting some physical stress.

# RECOMMENDATIONS

- Incorporate regular yoga and meditation practices- Include more rest days in your training schedule- Consider reducing high-intensity workouts like P90X during marathon training- Monitor telomere length and other biomarkers regularly- Balance charitable endurance activities with recovery-focused practices# ESTHER'S ADVICE

I just happened to have my third qualifying test when I became aware of

0:06

the competition and I remember looking at my results and thinking wait a minute this can't be right I'm thinking I must

0:12

be misinterpreting the results I think even at my worst my pace of Aging was maybe

0:18

0.8 what's your best result 0.66 we aged 7 months for every calendar

0:24

year so we get the other months for free

0:33

well it's been a few months since I interviewed someone who actually turned out to be a real popular guest Julie

0:39

Gibson Clark she is this uh gal who seems to be defying aging well at the

0:46

same time out outpacing or I should say under pacing the Aging rate of many of

0:53

the tech billionaires and biohackers out there uh based on this platform called

0:58

the rejuvenation Olympics where you can submit your true age genetic diagnostic

1:04

testing results and see how how fast or how slow you're aging well there's

1:10

somebody else who happens to be high high up on the leaderboard maybe near the top of it and he's my guest on

1:17

today's show his name is Dave Pasco uh Dave is 61 you correct me if I'm wrong

1:22

about that Dave but based on my stalking of you I believe that's your age but uh he looks like he's maybe under 40 you

1:30

you can watch the video of today's show to see Dave and also check out his Instagram and everything else I'll link

1:35

to in the show notes which you can find a Ben Greenfield life.com dve Pasco

1:40

Dave's last name is spelled p Coe so Dave Pasco Ben Greenfield life.com Dave

1:46

Pasco he is uh kind of like Julie defying aging but not spending millions

1:52

or billions of dollars a year doing it uh he's not vegan he's not calorie

1:59

restricted got a very unique approach so I figured what the heck Dave you and I might have a a pretty fun chat here

2:06

about all the stuff you're up to I think so oh and by the way for the listeners I

2:11

look way younger on the audio only version so you know I get the opposite I I get

2:18

the I get the the fact that a lot of people run into me on the streets and like oh we thought you were like you

2:23

know old and with a long beard and had glasses or something like for some reason people think I'm like professorial or something I I could see

2:31

that you have the brains for it so yeah occasionally yeah well I pretend so

2:36

anyways didn't you have a little bit of a history because I I think you and I might have a similar background in this

2:42

respect with uh Endurance Sports for a while or aren't you still into Endurance Sports to a certain degree kind of I

2:48

mean I'm I'm a terrible endurance athlete but I I still like to participate I'm very slow I'm one of

2:54

those slow AF Runners if you've heard of this um yeah so so what what exactly

2:59

does does Endor look like for you as far as your your participation in it so I've been doing um marathons with Team World

3:06

Vision I think you're familiar with World Vision I know you've done some 6ks with them yeah World World Vision is actually

3:13

I partner up with them so I Have This Journal called the spiritual disciplines journal and a portion of the proceeds of

3:19

every sale of that journal go to support World Vision and then they go and build wells in Africa and educate farmers and

3:27

do a lot of the great things that World Vision does in my family also supports a young Ethiopian girl who we kind of you

3:34

know adopted as a distance adoption through World Vision so I I absolutely love that company what they do oh that's

3:40

fantastic I had a chance to go to Africa with World Vision in 2019 and we got to

3:46

see some of the communities that we've affected with clean water and it was it was night and day compared to the

3:51

communities that still did not have clean water it was just incredible yeah I've been wanting to go on that trip

3:57

myself at the Ben Greenfield company we have a team Retreat every year and do this walk for water to raise money for

4:04

those clean water initiatives but I've never actually gone to Africa and boots on the ground seeing what it's doing but

4:11

but these runs that you're doing you use that as a way to to partner up with and and help raise funds for team World

4:16

Vision yep absolutely in fact I'm G to be doing a climb of Mount kjaro here at the end of July early August and that's

4:24

for child sponsorships well we might as well open up this can of worms right away man cuz

4:32

I I want to I want to definitely get into your history and how you got into longevity in the first place and and and

4:38

all the little things that you're doing to be so high on the leaderboard on the Rejuvenation Olympics but I don't know

4:45

if you're familiar with this researcher probably the foremost researcher who kind of uh has raised an eyebrow at

4:53

Endurance Sports and the potential for things like atherosclerosis or arterial stiffness or excessive aging from

5:01

excessive endurance exercise Dr James o' you know he certainly brought to light

5:06

the idea that too much endurance exercise could cause a lot of inflammation or accelerate aging or

5:13

cause arterial stiffness or you know or plaque buildup or things the like have you ever thought about that oh yeah um I

5:21

don't really think that endurance running is healthy for me it was something I do for charity so I I'm

5:27

willing to take the hit for the cause but it's not something I do for my longevity but yet you seem to to be

5:34

doing a pretty good job based on your your true age results despite that you know originally back like in 2012 I

5:41

think I learned this from you actually listening to one of your podcasts or probably reading one of your blogs back

5:46

then um I learned about telr and how they shorten with age every time a cell

5:52

divides and I learned about the telier test that you could get so I got the test thinking that you know hey I'm

5:58

going to be really great shape it's going to come back and tell me I've got the tel mirrors of a 20-year-old right I

6:03

was just turning 50 I was just starting my first marathon so I was deep into the training of that I was doing P90X I had

6:11

a really stressful job I was taking care of both of my elderly parents who were battling cancer at the same time and I

6:17

took this test and it said I had the telemeters of a 68y old at age 50 and I

6:24

was pretty shocked because that was not the results I was expecting um yeah ended up taking a um they had um you

6:32

could make a consultation call with them and so I took the call because I wanted to find out what they're what possibly

6:37

they could tell me and one of the first things they asked me which puzzled me is they wanted to know about my

6:44

lifestyle you know and at that point in my life I I knew lifestyle mattered somewhat like you know what you eat how

6:50

well you slept you know exercise was good but I guess I didn't understand the

6:56

depth of which My Lifestyle was causing me problems because as I started to explain to them about the stressful job

7:03

taking care of my parents doing P90X doing the marathon training they're like whoaa whoa whoa stop right there we've

7:09

seen this before we've seen this in endurance athletes that have very very short telr we've seen it in people who

7:16

are caretakers same way we've seen it with people who have incredibly stressful jobs so basically they

7:22

explained to me that the stress that I was putting myself under both you know emotionally and physically was eating me

7:29

alive so they suggested that I start you know maybe looking into doing things like

7:34

yoga meditation things that I had been doing earlier in my life and I just

7:40

completely forgotten about I mean you get busy the day-to-day life and you certain things fall on the floor and

7:46

those were two of the things that I stopped doing so yeah for my sanity and

7:51

for my health I had to start including more rest days um I had to drop P90X

7:57

while I was doing the marathon training um get back into yoga more meditation a

8:03

lot more SAA things that were better for my health yeah your your path sounds a

8:08

little bit similar to what actually led me to write that first book I wrote on

8:14

endurance training called Beyond training right the idea that being fit on the outside doesn't necessarily mean

8:20

that you're healthy on the inside and for me it was low testosterone uh thyroid

8:26

abnormalities joint pain elevated inflammation stress and similar to you

8:33

even though I I don't think and I'm sure that you've looked into this telr testing is the creme de La Creme of age

8:41

testing because it's kind of a small sampling of typically a small number of cells in the body and doesn't correlate

8:47

as well to longevity as like these new true age tests that I know you do now but yet it can give you a clue and it

8:53

was the same thing for me I'm like dude I'm like you know I forget what I was I think I was in the in the 50s when I was

8:58

in my 30s and it certainly made me think a little bit more about my Iron Man

9:03

training and Spartan training and kind of like you know massis Embrace of all these Adventures that similar to you are

9:11

can be very fulfilling and kind of be a version of climbing your own personal Mount Everest or in your case Kil manaro

9:18

but yeah you don't want to fool yourself into thinking that it's necessarily life extending but I also think is Nuance

9:24

Dave like you know if you look at James O'Keefe's research and he says that the benefits

9:30

of endurance training the so-called you know Goldilocks zone kind of tapers off

9:35

at around 15 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week I think that

9:43

that really does not specify Zone 2 endurance aerobic training meaning if

9:50

you're moving at a lowlevel physical activity throughout the day I'm walking on a treadmill while I'm talking to you

9:56

you know my wife might be out gardening for 6 hours out in the summer heat today

10:02

I I think that's far different than say the triathlete who's swimming in biking

10:07

and running at a level Rel relatively or or significantly above the

10:14

aerobic threshold you know kind of semi- running from a lion for multiple hours

10:20

per day or sometimes up to 20 hours per week so I think it kind of depends on what your definition of exercise is and

10:28

I think it is possible to actually be a marathoner or an Ultram marathoner or

10:33

like you say a slow AF triathlete and still get a decent amount of non-harmful

10:41

aerobic exercise per week but it's very very easy if you're competing in Triathlon marathoning Etc just because

10:47

of the nature of the competition and the training to have quite a few elevations

10:54

above that zone 2 Zone and exceed that 150 minutes pretty easily so so for you

10:59

with the telr testing I would imagine you you kind of started to take a deeper dive after that oh yeah I started

11:06

digging in everything I could about you know um really what telm were why they were shortened um what you can do to

11:13

lengthen them um I think at the time there really weren't any kind of tarase

11:19

activators available but I mean as soon as they did become available I began taking them oh you are you talking about

11:25

the the excessively highly priced uh like the TA what I forget what it is

11:31

ta65 and yeah ta65 Tam 818 yeah I interviewed Bill Andrews Way Back in the

11:37

Day explain to people what that means a t Tous activator okay so um apparently

11:43

through um the study of cancer cells they found that um for some reason

11:48

cancer cells didn't their their telr didn't shorten and they were producing an enzyme that was um allowing them to

11:56

lengthen and so they named this toomer race and by you know figuring out how

12:02

cancer cells were creating them they were able to produce synthetic versions of them and and offer them in pill form

12:09

and so yeah you probably know the science better than I do in fact I think I've learned at least half of what I

12:14

know from you so well yeah yeah you're definitely explaining it correctly yeah yeah so when you're activating tarase

12:21

you're essentially activating a pathway that is going to inhibit the excessive shortening of telome mirors unless

12:27

you're going to do a better job with DNA preservation and there are plant-based extracts that can do this like uh a

12:33

stralis would be one you know some of the elements of like blue green algy like spirina and chlorella can also have

12:39

similar activity you know human seed oil yeah gatu Cola there there's a lot of

12:45

different natural tarase activators that are kind of part of the almost like the

12:50

superfood protocol that you see a lot of people adopting but then some companies

12:56

have taken that to the next level and created kind of common that are really really powerful to L

13:01

race activators like you know the stuff that that I interviewed Bill Andrews about back in the day all linked to that

13:07

interview by the way in the in the show not to this podcast for people who want to take a deep dive into tommer Ras

13:12

activators but is that I mean Beyond toomas activators did you start to focus on some other things besides cutting

13:19

back the exercise and using tase activators yeah I really started um well

13:25

I started looking at all of my supplementation to be honest with you um because I was Tak taking a bunch of supplements and didn't necessarily know

13:31

why and I think I was trying to supplement myself out of a bad diet so I began looking at my food and trying to

13:38

remove the processed foods that I was eating and eat much more plants you know whole raw um green just good stuff

13:47

anything with a barcode on it you know had to go out out the window um yeah and

13:53

then just understanding why I was taking supplements start I started doing testing to see like did I even need

14:00

these things or not so besides the the the talir testing what kind of testing did you start doing um I found LIF

14:06

length as a company I was able to get good blood test through them I tried to get blood test through my doctor in fact

14:13

I remember specifically asking him about you know getting a hormone panel because I wanted to know what my you know

14:20

testosterone and my estrogens were doing and he looked at me and he laughed he goes estrogens you don't need that only

14:27

women have estrogens yeah which is complete bunk by the way I mean chapter 16 in my book boundless has a deep dive

14:33

into the benefits specifically of looking at at estrad but full estrogen panel for both men and women I I think

14:40

that's clutch you know for for brain function for free testosterone like there's a lot of reasons but but uh

14:46

anyways you asked your doctor about that and they declined uh yeah I'm thinking this guy had one job and he couldn't

14:52

even get that right I mean it was very disappointing um yeah so he gave me a testosterone test but I don't even think

14:58

it um can't remember it was either just free or total it wasn't both yeah Pro

15:05

prob probably a blood total testosterone that's what a lot of doctors are GNA order so I mean that was not helpful to

15:11

me so I just did it myself through LIF length not life sorry that's the telm your test um life

15:18

extension so I could get their male Elite panel in fact now that I think about it my very first test was not

15:25

through them it was through Quest and it was the Ben Green Field longevity panel

15:31

yeah yeah yeah I partnered up with Wellness FX way back in the day I used to advise Wellness FX on their panels

15:36

and we came out with this massive I don't think it's available now I've replicated some of those panels you can

15:41

find on my website but yeah it was this massive like mail panel that just tested all the things that maybe you'd have a

15:47

hard time convincing your doctor to were for you i' totally forgotten about that until just now but yeah and that

15:53

provided some really good data to take a look at and and start changing up supplement to try to Target things into

16:01

a I wouldn't say the reference ranges because I mean as we now know the

16:06

reference ranges are the range of you know the averages of sick people that their doctors say yeah you've got this

16:13

problem all right let's give you a blood test um because if you're healthy they won't test your blood it's rather

16:19

maddening um so yeah I try to Target the range of say healthy Collegiate athletes

16:26

to try to Target my supplementation too and where did the the Rejuvenation Olympics enter into the scene for you

16:33

that was kind of by surprise because I didn't know anything about it when I was doing my true diagnostic testing I

16:39

learned about true diagnostic again I suspect it might have been from you back in the day um or it

16:46

was some podcast but it was probably you um so I was using the them as just

16:52

another you know another marker for how I was performing like just to Val

16:57

depth of which My Lifestyle was causing me problems because as I started to explain to them about the stressful job

7:03

taking care of my parents doing P90X doing the marathon training they're like whoaa whoa whoa stop right there we've

of endurance training the so-called you know Goldilocks zone kind of tapers off

9:35

at around 15 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week I think that

9:43

that really does not specify Zone 2 endurance aerobic training meaning if

9:50

you're moving at a lowlevel physical activity throughout the day I'm walking on a treadmill while I'm talking to you

9:56

you know my wife might be out gardening for 6 hours out in the summer heat today

10:02

I I think that's far different than say the triathlete who's swimming in biking

10:07

and running at a level Rel relatively or or significantly above the

10:14

aerobic threshold you know kind of semi- running from a lion for multiple hours

10:20

per day or sometimes up to 20 hours per week so I think it kind of depends on what your definition of exercise is and

10:28

I think it is possible to actually be a marathoner or an Ultram marathoner or

10:33

like you say a slow AF triathlete and still get a decent amount of non-harmful

10:41

aerobic exercise per week but it's very very easy if you're competing in Triathlon marathoning Etc just because

10:47

of the nature of the competition and the training to have quite a few elevations

10:54

above that zone 2 Zone and exceed that 150 minutes pretty easily so so for you

10:59

with the telr testing I would imagine you you kind of started to take a deeper dive after that oh yeah I started

11:06

digging in everything I could about you know um really what telm were why they were shortened um what you can do to

11:13

lengthen them um I think at the time there really weren't any kind of tarase

11:19

activators available but I mean as soon as they did become available I began taking them oh you are you talking about

11:25

the the excessively highly priced uh like the TA what I forget what it is

11:31

ta65 and yeah ta65 Tam 818 yeah I interviewed Bill Andrews Way Back in the

11:37

Day explain to people what that means a t Tous activator okay so um apparently

11:43

through um the study of cancer cells they found that um for some reason

11:48

cancer cells didn't their their telr didn't shorten and they were producing an enzyme that was um allowing them to

11:56

lengthen and so they named this toomer race and by you know figuring out how

12:02

cancer cells were creating them they were able to produce synthetic versions of them and and offer them in pill form

12:09

and so yeah you probably know the science better than I do in fact I think I've learned at least half of what I

12:14

know from you so well yeah yeah you're definitely explaining it correctly yeah yeah so when you're activating tarase

12:21

you're essentially activating a pathway that is going to inhibit the excessive shortening of telome mirors unless

12:27

you're going to do a better job with DNA preservation and there are plant-based extracts that can do this like uh a

12:33

stralis would be one you know some of the elements of like blue green algy like spirina and chlorella can also have

12:39

similar activity you know human seed oil yeah gatu Cola there there's a lot of

12:45

different natural tarase activators that are kind of part of the almost like the

12:50

superfood protocol that you see a lot of people adopting but then some companies

12:56

have taken that to the next level and created kind of common that are really really powerful to L

13:01

race activators like you know the stuff that that I interviewed Bill Andrews about back in the day all linked to that

13:07

interview by the way in the in the show not to this podcast for people who want to take a deep dive into tommer Ras

13:12

activators but is that I mean Beyond toomas activators did you start to focus on some other things besides cutting

13:19

back the exercise and using tase activators yeah I really started um well

13:25

I started looking at all of my supplementation to be honest with you um because I was Tak taking a bunch of supplements and didn't necessarily know

13:31

why and I think I was trying to supplement myself out of a bad diet so I began looking at my food and trying to

13:38

remove the processed foods that I was eating and eat much more plants you know whole raw um green just good stuff

13:47

anything with a barcode on it you know had to go out out the window um yeah and

13:53

then just understanding why I was taking supplements start I started doing testing to see like did I even need

14:00

these things or not so besides the the the talir testing what kind of testing did you start doing um I found LIF

14:06

length as a company I was able to get good blood test through them I tried to get blood test through my doctor in fact

14:13

I remember specifically asking him about you know getting a hormone panel because I wanted to know what my you know

14:20

testosterone and my estrogens were doing and he looked at me and he laughed he goes estrogens you don't need that only

14:27

women have estrogens yeah which is complete bunk by the way I mean chapter 16 in my book boundless has a deep dive

14:33

into the benefits specifically of looking at at estrad but full estrogen panel for both men and women I I think

14:40

that's clutch you know for for brain function for free testosterone like there's a lot of reasons but but uh

14:46

anyways you asked your doctor about that and they declined uh yeah I'm thinking this guy had one job and he couldn't

14:52

even get that right I mean it was very disappointing um yeah so he gave me a testosterone test but I don't even think

14:58

it um can't remember it was either just free or total it wasn't both yeah Pro

15:05

prob probably a blood total testosterone that's what a lot of doctors are GNA order so I mean that was not helpful to

15:11

me so I just did it myself through LIF length not life sorry that's the telm your test um life

15:18

extension so I could get their male Elite panel in fact now that I think about it my very first test was not

15:25

through them it was through Quest and it was the Ben Green Field longevity panel

15:31

yeah yeah yeah I partnered up with Wellness FX way back in the day I used to advise Wellness FX on their panels

15:36

and we came out with this massive I don't think it's available now I've replicated some of those panels you can

15:41

find on my website but yeah it was this massive like mail panel that just tested all the things that maybe you'd have a

15:47

hard time convincing your doctor to were for you i' totally forgotten about that until just now but yeah and that

15:53

provided some really good data to take a look at and and start changing up supplement to try to Target things into

16:01

a I wouldn't say the reference ranges because I mean as we now know the

16:06

reference ranges are the range of you know the averages of sick people that their doctors say yeah you've got this

16:13

problem all right let's give you a blood test um because if you're healthy they won't test your blood it's rather

16:19

maddening um so yeah I try to Target the range of say healthy Collegiate athletes

16:26

to try to Target my supplementation too and where did the the Rejuvenation Olympics enter into the scene for you

16:33

that was kind of by surprise because I didn't know anything about it when I was doing my true diagnostic testing I

16:39

learned about true diagnostic again I suspect it might have been from you back in the day um or it

16:46

was some podcast but it was probably you um so I was using the them as just

16:52

another you know another marker for how I was performing like just to Val

16:57

validate that my supplement ation was not causing me harm and and was pointing

17:03

things in the proper direction so I just happened to have my third qualifying

17:08

test when um I became aware of the competition and I remember looking at my

17:14

results I'm thinking wait a minute this this can't be right am I actually beating this this billionaire guy I'm

17:22

thinking I must be Mis misinterpreting the result do you mean Brian Johnson uh

17:27

yeah that guy yeah okay yeah um and so I submitted my results thinking that they

17:34

were just going to come back and tell me no no you're misinterpreting that you're not you're not beating Brian uh or it

17:40

would have been that I was beating Brian and then the question was going to be will they actually you know publish my

17:47

results if I'm beating them and to their credit they did right and and you you would question that just because I think

17:52

he's involved with promotion of the Rejuvenation Olympics and I you know I know Brian I've interviewed him I I

17:58

think he's actually you know an ethical guy I don't think he would like tweak the results to ensure that you know so he could sell more olive oil he'd appear

18:04

towards the top of the charts it doesn't appear that he's he's doing that but you know similar to when I saw Julie

18:10

Gibson's Julie Gibson Clark's results you know I saw yours I've met you a couple times you know saw you down in

18:16

Austin and I thought well gosh like you know he's he's definitely not getting Young Blood transfers but and you know

18:22

still doing endurance training and you know climbing Mount Kil magaro and you know doing the things that you're doing

18:28

so I thought it was very interesting that that your pace of Aging is so low yeah that was very surprising to me as

18:34

well I think even at my worst my pace of Aging uh I think my highest test was maybe

18:40

0.8 I think it was right and what what's your what's your best result for your age age pacing

18:46

0.66 so for so for every year like if you take 365 days of every year you

18:52

would only be Aging for 0.66 of those days which comes out to what 250 in the rough MTH in my head 250 260

19:01

something days we get seven months um we age seven months for every calendar year

19:06

so we get the other months for free yeah how much of this do you think is contributed uh or or how much of this is

19:14

is attributed to genetics like what do your parents look like um if you saw my

19:19

family and I don't want to throw my family under the bus yeah I wouldn't say that any of us look particularly young

19:25

in fact my family tends to be overweight on

19:31

average um although you know both of my parents have since passed and they both

19:36

lived to the rip old age of 89 despite not exercising smoking drinking not

19:43

eating well so I don't deny that there's some good genetics there that sounds

19:48

like my wife's side of the family you know Montana ranchers living up into their 90s and not really you know eating candy and you know drinking alcohol and

19:55

not necessarily doing you know red light therapies and coffee so yeah I'm sure you've had a little bit

20:01

of a good genetic hand dealt to you but I'm also curious like I want to jump into your actual protocol and what what

20:08

it looks like on a day-to-day basis as far as the big wins for you beyond some of the the general overview that you

20:14

given us so far so you don't mind we got time I want to take a deep dive into what what a day in the life of Dave

20:20

looks like pretty much even before I get out of bed I have a a pmf mat that I I

20:26

lay on it's underneath my eight sleeve and I crank that up and I do some

20:31

stretching before I even get out of bed what kind of pmf mat do you use to Beamer if you're yeah yeah it's a good

20:39

one yeah they've got some good studies for uh blood flow I'm I'm sure they do many of many other things but I think

20:46

one of the only claims that they can make for the fda's purposes is the the benefit to blood flow and so when you

20:52

crank that up are you just laying there are you doing journaling or meditation or anything like that I'm you know I'm

20:58

think thinking about my day well okay so to be honest with you and I I guess I can say her name because I think I've

21:04

put it into Do Not Disturb mode but I have a uh Amazon Echo Dot and so I will

21:11

call her Amelia right now so that she doesn't respond but I have uh I have a smart home so I have everything

21:17

programmed and I basically will say good morning to her and she will start

21:23

telling me what's going on in my day she'll read to me what's happening on my calendar um tell me the weather let me

21:30

know um you know a fun fact and then she'll start giving me the the latest news from CNN Fox News and ABC News so

21:39

at least I'm kind of fueling my brain while I'm laying there and by the way have we established the fact and we

21:45

probably should have established this earlier on you're not married and you don't have kids correct okay all right

21:52

that that makes a little bit better sense now with with the morning chat with the with the bot yeah yeah in fact

21:58

it's one of the comments I see most um to things that get posted about me is they always say he's single no kids

22:05

that's it that's the secret that's the secret to L I don't know yeah yeah I

22:11

mean you know from from a if you want to really you know get a little bit esoteric and step back and look at this

22:17

from an ancestral and evolutionary standpoint it is true that if you have children you have in a way fabricated

22:25

some sense of immortality or life extension in the progy that you've created to come after you that would

22:31

theoretically give your body a biological me message that it doesn't have to cling it so many years because

22:37

you know you're living on through your children and I think they've even you know shown everything from droing testosterone with marriage and children

22:44

and Men which might also be a uh a an unw wering mechanism to keep a man

22:50

around the house so to speak uh but I I think that there actually is something to the potential for you know even

22:56

though I'm a happily married man with children you know if you don't have children you might actually send your body a

23:02

biological mechanism that or biological message that it might want to extend lifespan a little bit Yeah there's still

23:09

hope going on up here so yeah so um yeah so I I'll do the

23:15

stretching um I'll move from that I'll I'll probably do like five minutes bouncing on my little rebounder uh which

23:23

tends to get the bowels moving um and then I'll do a little bit of uh uh

23:28

incline on my um my incline table which I just in other podcast it's been behind

23:35

me which I think is been really obnoxious so I moved it just out of the frame here thankfully um but I have

23:41

these things set up so I have to trip on them on the way to the bathroom so it's it's nothing I have to go out of my way

23:47

to do it's just on the path right so it's a reverse psychology keeping the the uh the bowl of M&M's off the kitchen

23:53

counter so you don't eat it every time you walk by it's like me I got a kettle bell on the floor in my office and a Carol bike and a elastic van and a

24:00

couple of 10 pound dumbbells so every time I'm wandering in and out of my office I'm always stopping to exercise on something so you do the rebounder in

24:07

the morning and that you're right that is great to get the balls moving as a matter of fact it's kind of funny uh I I

24:13

have a biocharger which is this fancy device that does like you know red light

24:19

therapy and negative ions and pmf and all this stuff all at once it's kind of like a a stack of a bunch of biohacks

24:26

and it comes with all these different recipes for inflammation for lymph whatever but there's a recipe on there called raisin brand every time I do it

24:33

every time I do it with one of my friends the first response is like we got to go poop like crazy as a matter of

24:39

fact I avoid using it a lot of mornings because we always have family meditation at 7 a.m. which is like typically right

24:46

after I finish my biocharger session and I don't like to have to literally like take a crap during family meditation but

24:52

yes jumping up and down on the trampoline can elicit a similar effect you're right so I do that and then I

24:58

eventually I move down to the basement do my Carol bike I do that about every other day and explain that one to people

25:04

who who aren't familiar with it okay so it's uh it's an aid driven bike that uh

25:11

it's it's high-intensity interval training and the way I do it I do it the

25:16

uh the two 22 Sprints right which can be exhausting by the way if you actually go

25:23

as hard as you're supposed to go I just got back from the health optimization Summit in London

25:28

and I raced the guy who was running the Carol bike booth on it we did the 2x22

25:34

protocol he maxed out at like 1300 Watts which is through the roof I think I only

25:39

hit like 850 and uh you're just you know two two 20 second intervals doesn't

25:45

sound like much but if you don't have much time to exercise it will definitely

25:50

improve mitochondrial proliferation lactic acid tolerance give you a huge aerobic boost metabolic increase with

25:58

with pretty shockingly short period of time spent exercising so you got your Carol bike uh what comes next um so then

26:06

I'm mixing up a concoction of a bunch of different uh protein powders and um

26:13

Lucine and El citrine and yeah the whole list is on my website but I'll mix that

26:19

up I'll drink it um then I'll start the p9x workout okay so quick question before I jump into your P90X that

26:26

pre-workout protein and everything that you do are you doing any type of intermittent fasting like how long is it

26:32

after you've had your last meal the night before that you're jumping into like a a feeding protocol breaking the fast so be yeah good question I try to

26:40

eat dinner like between maybe 3 and 5: PM oh gosh you're killing me all all all

26:46

the longevity enthusiasts I talk to you guys all eat so early and that that's the part about having a family man as we

26:53

have these big glorious family dinners but I'm still burping up steak when I get in the bed at night and I know I know know that that I would have better

26:59

autophagy if I didn't but yeah I'm I'm uh I'm definitely aware of the fact that eating

27:05

earlier is better but that's pretty early what' you say between three and five between three and five I like to be

27:10

finished eating before six so if I can finish eating by five o'clock that's terrific and what time do you go to bed

27:17

usually I try to get to bed about between maybe 8:30 and 9:30 and you

27:23

don't struggle with having finished dinner let's say at 5 and you got social events Etc afterwards you you don't

27:30

struggle with thinking about eating and you know throwing a little extra food here and there it happens yeah I mean

27:36

life gets in the way all the time but generally like your last major meal of the day is like late afternoon very

27:42

early evening yeah like I said I find my sleep squares are much better when I'm not digesting yeah yeah me me too but

27:50

kind of like you're kind of like your endurance training and you know climbing the mountain you knowing that that might

27:56

not be the best thing for longevity it's kind of like me with family happiness togetherness relationship Community it's

28:02

just like eating late is one of those things that that that's still in my protocol despite that not being ideal

28:09

okay so you have your protein and then and then you go into P90X which you're still doing even though you found out

28:15

you know that that it might not be that healthy for you you still do it yeah I don't I don't kill the entire exercise I

28:21

mean I pretty much do maybe three qus of it now because I I I think a lot of the

28:28

things in P90X they have you go through the whole circuit twice okay I actually

28:34

haven't seen a P90X workout in Forever how do those go it's yeah it's I think it came out in 2006 I found it in 2008

28:42

and I've been doing it pretty much since then so yeah every other day is a

28:48

weightbearing exercise so you might have chest and back one day and then um chest shoulders and tries another day

28:56

back and biceps a different day um but in between those you'll have cardio days so there might be a day of

29:03

Plyometrics a day of Kempo Karate a day of um like really extreme

29:09

yoga and then every other day there's a an Ab Ripper X program that does a great

29:16

job at shredding your abs yeah well I've seen I've seen your Instagram photos man you do have the one of the better six-

29:23

packs of a 60 plus year old I've seen so something's working so you do P90X and then what um so then I'll usually follow

29:29

that up with a sauna session my sauna is like probably my favorite biohack it was

29:34

one of my first purchases of biohacking stuff um again I think I learned about

29:40

it from you on your podcast in fact I ended up buying the same sauna that you did from heal withth heat.com okay so so

29:48

in your sauna session you are you just like sitting there are you stretching meditating breath work anything like

29:54

that I don't have enough room in mind to work out like you do in yours so um I'll

29:59

split 5050 whether I'll be doing uh meditation or I might just be goofing

30:05

off and watching Netflix all right so you got the sauna and then what comes next um shower and then pretty much on

30:12

with my day okay what in your actual job you're an engineer right yeah well was

30:18

as of September all right so so before you would have gone on to your job but now what do you do after you done your

30:24

Sonic session you just sit around listen to podcast all day well you know it's funny because when I

30:29

was still working I think I was a lot more regimented because I I had you know the eight hours of the day with

30:36

conference calls and there were things I had to do at certain times and then you know so I had to force myself to get the

30:43

biohacking in at specific times now that my time is more free form

30:49

it's I I'd like to I hate to say but I think I'm a little less regimented now until I can come up with some some new

30:56

patterns but um building my website doing these

31:01

interviews um going on trips it's almost become a whole new career direction for

31:08

me by the way your website's fantastic we're kind of like Brian Johnson you do a good job laying out your whole protocol much better job than I do by

31:15

the way uh so anyways I have of course because you have a lot of your information out there publicly Dave like

31:22

I do with a lot of my guests or all of them really you know I stalk you I read about you I do my research and I have

31:29

found a few interesting things out about you for example uh you're not really into like the calorie restriction thing

31:36

no not at all not at all in fact my friends make fun of me when we go out to restaurants because I will order two

31:43

meals I eat like a pig I don't I don't count calories but usually when I'm

31:49

eating at home or even when I'm eating out the very first meal that I have is an enormous

31:54

salad so I'm I'm stuffing myself on you know vegetables to start with then I'll

32:00

usually follow that up with a meat and maybe some carbs but the meat would be you know condiment size portions so I I

32:08

like to say I have a a favorite restaurant which is Ford's Garage locally the first thing I'll get is a

32:13

berries and gorganzola salad with shrimp and it's huge it's a meal in itself it's

32:19

larger than my head maybe two of my head put together and I'll eat that first and

32:24

then people are like wow you really killed that and like yeah that's only my first meal then I ordered the um

32:30

Mushroom Swiss burger with avocado and an egg sunny side up and then uh yeah I

32:37

kill that usually get like a side of either their mac and cheese or or if I'm really behaving it's just a big side of

32:43

broccoli well I've seen a lot of restaurant menus that right there that you just described is probably pushing around 3,000 calories for a meal I

32:50

wouldn't be surprised yeah yeah yeah okay so so why is it that you you aren't on the same kind of like calorie

32:56

restriction bandwagon as a lot of these fol folks you know even Brian Johnson when I interviewed him I think he said you know every calorie has a fight for

33:01

its life what is it about your protocol that inspires you to just kind of eat ad lium honestly I don't know I I really

33:08

don't know um I think it's because I'm just so physically active during the day that I'm burning a lot of those calories

33:15

and so I know my I know my metabolism is fast because of that yeah well you know

33:20

what Dave I I think you nailed it your protocol is very similar to mine I eat like a horse I probably eat around 4,000

33:27

calories a day I still earn itting fast 12 to 16 hours a day as we've established you know I do eat later on

33:33

in the day my first meal typically is until around 10: a.m. or so I have usually a quick smoothie before I hop on

33:38

a podcast or whatever but this idea of the it's I believe it's called the

33:45

metabolic theory of energy this idea that you fuel your body well with really good nutrient-dense clean foods and then

33:50

you engage in a high level of physical activity throughout the day versus fasting being somewhat sedentary being

33:57

cold and hungry and libidol less and just kind of doing your whatever your cryotherapy and a little bit of elastic band movement and stretching you know

34:05

I'm I'm kind of one of those guys who's a little bit more like uh eat like a horse and swing kettle bells right that

34:11

that's kind of my Approach is a is and maybe that's influenced a lot by my background in Iron Man where you know

34:18

for me now working out maybe eight hours a week feels like nothing you know compared to the 15 hours a week I used

34:24

to work out but yeah this idea of eating a really good amount of calorically dense food not excessively restricting

34:31

carbohydrates and having a high level of physical activity I think it lends itself well to just life enjoyment

34:37

adventuring and getting out and doing a lot of things also and frankly like food

34:43

is an enjoyable part of life it does also allow you to to enjoy more food I totally agree and I I usually strive for

34:50

that maximum nutritional density too so and I like to mix it up I don't like to have the same meal every day I know

34:57

Brian with the same stuff day in and day out that would get boring to me yeah

35:02

yeah I I usually have the same kind of smoothie in the morning lunch varies a lot of times leftovers but then dinner

35:08

widely varies you we're always cooking together as a family and just kind of sometimes it's chicken sometimes pork

35:13

sometimes steaks sometimes scrambled eggs and Waffles you know you name it so the uh the interesting thing though and

35:20

I'm sure some people might ask this so I'm going to backpedal for a second you know when you talk about like the salad

35:26

with the shrimp which can be you know in some cases like a potentially toxin or

35:32

metal Laden shellfish or when you talk about like you know the Alexa or the eight sleep or the potential for EMF it

35:39

sounds to me like you aren't super orthorexic when it comes to a lot of the things that people really really try to

35:45

limit like EMF exposure or like all super duper clean organic stuff or am I

35:51

misunderstanding that well no usually the food that I do is super duper organic I mean I I buy organic

35:58

vegetables um all my my meat comes from butcher box so it's grass-fed grass finished you know the free range chicken

36:05

the Alaskan wild caught salmon um yeah so I mean food I don't I don't skimp on

36:11

at all I'll I'll spend the money for that but when it comes to emfs yeah I think people would freak out coming to

36:17

my house thinking that I live in a toxic soup of emfs because it is a smart home

36:23

and every um every bulb in my recess lighting is a philp two bulb so it's all

36:28

it's all they're all Bluetooth connected and I've got these Amazon Echo dots in every room and um yeah I mean pretty

36:37

much everything in my house is programmed but I do employ some EMF

36:43

mitigations like I have a Blue Shield Cube U here in my bedroom and it's big

36:50

enough it's supposed to take you know uh take over the whole house and plus my neighbors as well so presumably that's

36:58

you know putting out some scaler waves that are overriding any of the you know EMF waves that might be impacting me

37:05

okay so you're aware of it you're you're you're not really converting your home into a stupid home like I have with mine

37:10

you still have a smart home but you've got some EMF mitigation devices in there powerful enough to where it sounds like

37:15

your neighbors might need to be writing you a royalty check for their their borrowed EMF protection even my smart

37:22

meter when I I got the house resided about a year ago I um I bought a bunch

37:28

of different type of uh shielding Fabric and I had that placed between the smart

37:33

meter and my house like a pretty large sloth that way it's not radiating into

37:39

the house it's reflected back out yeah so maybe you are in the tinf foil hat wearing Club all right another thing I

37:46

found out about you Dave is you've got pretty decent testosterone levels but to my understanding at least as far as I

37:52

know you're not using testosterone replacement therapy that's true tell me about that so when I started looking at

37:59

my markers I noticed that my DHEA and my pregnanolone were a little low compared

38:06

to what I thought they should have been for a healthy Collegiate athlete so I began supplementing with those and I

38:14

think for for folks that know things about hormones they know that those are Upstream precursors of testosterone and

38:22

estrogen and if you supplement the Upstream precursors you're going to get

38:28

boosts in those Downstream hormones and I saw a pretty good size you know um

38:35

increase in my testosterone from doing that I also saw that from just getting

38:40

out and running I I got a really nice kick in my testosterone so I get I get frustrated

38:47

when friends of mine tell me that you know they just go right to their doctor and get testosterone replacement and

38:53

their doctor didn't even check any of those things and they didn't try any of those things first yeah addressing

38:59

lifestyle and other supplementation factors what what are your levels at by the way do you know what your total or your free levels are at approximately um

39:06

I so I don't know this month but I check usually every month and my range from like in

39:13

2023 went from about 809 to like 1295 I think it was oh holy cow for a trt free

39:20

61y old that's that's really good now now quick rapid fire for you you know

39:26

you mentioned DHEA and Pregnant alone uh we know you're you're lifting weights and exercising uh rapid fire do you do

39:34

cryotherapy you're cold thermogenesis uh cold showers okay okay

39:40

uh use vitamin D yes uh creatine absolutely

39:47

magnesium yep every night I don't do it in the daytime because I I do um thyroid

39:52

replacement hormone and that would impact my uptake of yeah absolutely okay

39:57

um uh using minerals like Boron for example Yes actually Boron I know that

40:04

actually helps with testosterone anecdotally but I was taking it because my cardiologist Dr Joel Khan had

40:10

recommended that due to studies for heart health yeah so yeah yeah he's on the right track so everything I just

40:15

asked you about that you do also increases testosterone so you're basically kind of like on the gold

40:20

standard protocol for what somebody would be doing if they wanted to have elevated testosterone without trt except

40:28

maybe the the whole cold shower thing your balls don't get quite as cold as a cold soak as you probably know and so

40:35

that is another thing you know probably Dr uh Thomas uh uh Seager uh the guy who

40:41

helped to create the morasco forge that I used to soak in you know he's got lots of anecdotal uh you can't really call it

40:49

research but case reports of guys who have increased their testosterone considerably with these cold water soaks

40:56

I was doing that I actually bought bought a 7 foot chest freezer and I cocked the seams in and it's it's in my

41:02

backyard and I used to fill that every every year because I live in Michigan so it doesn't you can't have that during

41:07

the winter time that would freeze solid and so I would use that but it's it's just not real practical because I like

41:13

to put lotions on and so I'd have to take a shower first so that I don't scum it up with lotions and then just there's

41:20

nothing to keep it clean I didn't have any kind of um you know there's no filter or anything for it so it just get

41:27

scummy too quick yeah yeah and i' I've taken showers in Michigan before the water gets plenty cold how about um how

41:33

about before sleep what's your sleep protocol look like so being in the smart home I do have the all of the lighting

41:40

start shifting to red as the sun goes down so it it automatically turns red

41:46

and gradually dims as the evening progresses and then I have every one of my screens automatically shift to Red so

41:54

the blue blocker option turns on do you use a special software for that by the way for the screens I used to I don't

42:02

seem to have to anymore because I think with Windows 11 it's sort of built in I'll put Blue blockers on you know the

42:08

the really ugly looking red ones which is probably another reason why I'm single um to black out everything else

42:15

so light mitigation before you get into bed anything else that you do supplement wise or with the pmf or anything like

42:22

that to get you into the sleep mode I do use the pmf again as I'm falling asleep

42:29

um along with you know counting my blessings for the day which you know usually pretty numerous um and that

42:36

gives me a a great Blissful sleep because I'm just ending my day in gratitude which I love um but yeah I I

42:46

will do a little Netflix but I'll try to cut that short so that I'm not getting

42:51

stimulation from a good exciting show just before bed I'll try not to do any

42:56

EX exercise before bed because I know that that rils me up and then I don't sleep as well but usually I'm pretty

43:03

exhausted from the day that by the time I my head hits the pillow I I go out I'm out quick yeah I'd be very very curious

43:10

how much that early Meal Time influences that because most of the data I've seen is that it will improve sleep latency

43:17

considerably when you travel are there any fundamental tools or must haves that you take with you with all this travel

43:23

that you're doing now that are kind of like the non-negotiables that would go into your suitcase or your carryon

43:29

whether it's a supplement or or a tool or anything like that I've tried to learn a lot from your protocols but I to

43:36

be honest no I haven't really come up with a a good strategy for traveling and I need to because my travel sleep is

43:43

pretty pretty bad oh okay yeah well I guess I guess I could share with

43:50

you since we're here um probably my Big E would be on the actual flight itself

43:56

hi tablets or a hydrogen water bottle uh ketones so that I don't need to eat the

44:03

meals in the airport or on the airplane they also have an anti-inflammatory effect which is helpful for the for the

44:09

radiation uh magnesium which usually I only take before bed but for a long Hall flight I will take it prior to the

44:15

flight because it helps a little bit with the EMF and the radiation and the the calcium influx into the cells uh and

44:22

then I have typically one of those Apollo wearables that I put on my ankle

44:28

and between that noise blocking headphones the newal app and a sleep mask I can just sleep during an entire

44:36

flight which is great because I I I actually really love to sleep on airplanes now because it's like the one

44:42

time I'm not expected to be online or available to anyone or on a phone call so with that protocol I sleep pretty

44:49

well in the airplane and then uh I do actually wear speak of the devil EMF

44:55

blocking gear I used some by a company called no choice uh Lambs is another good one Leela Quantum Tech now is

45:02

making them but I use some kind of EMF blocking gear especially for the Long Haul flights the one to London that I

45:10

was just on and then when I get to Final Destination Hotel uh I always do

45:15

grounding uh almost always do a cold shower or a cold soak or a cold water swim I wear like you do the blue light

45:23

blocking glasses but I also travel with a little red light headlamp like a cheap $15 headlamp from Amazon so I can have

45:30

the lights off in the hotel room at night and just get around with that with the curtains closed and the lights off I

45:36

do highdose melatonin right before bed like a mega do the first one to two

45:43

nights when I get to my final destination so that's just kind of reboots the Circadian rhythm and that's

45:48

why I'm traveling across multiple time zones and then finally when I get up in

45:53

the morning I use a couple of portable blue light producing devices I use one called the uh retim glasses that produce

46:02

like a bluish green light that kind of wakes up your eyes uh there's another brand called the io AO similar thing and

46:09

then this other one called the human charger that puts bright lights in the ears and between all that bright light

46:15

in the morning and then the mitigation of light at night some of those airplane hacks and then a little bit of grounding

46:20

and earthing and cold I tend to do honestly these days I sleep better when

46:26

I travel again absence of kids absence of wife I eat dinner earlier you know

46:31

some of the things I'm not doing at home I typically average about eight and a half to nine hours of sleep at night

46:37

when I travel with that protocol compared to six and a half to seven at

46:43

home just with all my duties and obligations and work and you know family and everything that I need at home so

46:48

that's kind of kind of most of my jam I probably forgot a few things that's fantastic yeah I'll I'll do some of the

46:55

airplane ones that you mentioned have the noise cancelling headphones I'll do the hydrogen tablets AA

47:02

anthon yeah oh that's a great as an antioxidant absolutely I forgot by the way I usually will wear for a long haul

47:08

flight one of these NAD patches there's a company called ion layer that makes

47:14

it's kind of like getting an NAD IV the entire time you're flying but I just put a little patch on my upper butt off or

47:20

my abs and it just does a slow delivery of about 500 milligrams of NAD into my

47:25

system for about 12 hours yeah see I wouldn't have thought someone of your age would have really even

47:30

needed any additional NAD I feel remarkably better using it when I travel

47:37

and using it on any day for which I'm sleep deprived I don't notice it that much if I'm not beat up and I'm not

47:42

traveling I'm not sleep deprived but I I do notice a significant uptick in energy I don't put a lot of credence in these

47:49

current NAD level tests to test your Ned levels I don't think they're that accurate Chris Master John actually did

47:55

a did a substack about the potential inaccuracy of some of these tests but just subjectively I feel

48:01

good if I use NAD when I'm beat up for sure I you know I question the inaccuracies of all of the tests to be

48:07

honest with you because I've I've had a few tests where the same sample got ran twice by accident yeah and came up with

48:13

totally different results I've seen this too yeah so so Dave are there things out there you know especially with your

48:19

travel now I know you were at one of the health conferences I was at you see a lot of this stuff you're now talking to

48:25

more people you're doing more podcast you know you mention you're listening to podcast are there things that you'd like

48:30

to try or Implement that you haven't yet oh gosh yeah lots um well I know that

48:37

everybody seems to be doing the faten gene therapy now I know you've done it Dave ase's done it Brian's done it uh

48:43

that would be awesome it's incredible yeah it's obviously a dent in the pocketbook but the amount of muscle gain

48:49

and Recovery matter of fact I'm probably going to go back to Dr Khan's clinic in

48:55

Dubai in October and follow that up with the gene therapy for testosterone called

49:02

luteinizing hormone therapy and then the one for cognition and NAD called clotho

49:07

theapy because I was so I mean quick five minute intramuscular injection it's kind of like a cheat cat on life oh that

49:15

would be fantastic those are definitely not my wish list um those in the full body stem cell makeover I think if you

49:21

were to do anything that was kind of expensive and you wanted to approximate the Feeling Just just doing like an

49:27

exosome infusion because you're going to mobilize your own stem cell pool and you're a healthy guy who's already doing

49:32

a lot of things right you probably have pretty good stem cells you know stored away in your marrow already and the

49:38

latest you know it was a rodent study on exosome infusions produced a 16% increase in lifespan based on

49:45

mitochondrial Pathways so I think you know even though those also you know those sometimes are few thousand bucks

49:51

of V it's still less than you know 70,000 I did just do that recently I

49:56

joined Dr Sandra Kaufman has club exome and so I joined that in Las Vegas two weeks ago

50:03

that's funny I was with her at a conference in Utah a few weeks ago and she pulled me aside before dinner and shoved some exosomes into me so yeah she

50:11

she she's the exosome lady apparently any like gear that that you've seen out there that you think would be super cool

50:17

to own oh I would love to own a vasper I just don't have the space for that or

50:22

the or the pocketbook for that you know the poor man's version or the at least the budget version you put on bfr or

50:29

blood restriction bands you get on an exercise biker and elliptical trainer uh you do a hit workout and you

50:36

preferably figure out a way to be cold during the workout like you junk jump in the cold pool before and after for

50:42

example so because the vasper is Cold bfr full body training and then because you're on copper plates there's also

50:48

like a grounding component but basically doing full body exercise with bfr bands on you get kind of like around 70% of

50:56

you know the the effects of something like that even though it's not as you know sexy and convenient well you're

51:01

going to laugh because uh I do that I have bfr bands I I crank the air

51:07

conditioning up really high and force it into the basement I get on the Carol bike and I'll do do a workout with the

51:14

bfr bands on it I never even considered that as being the poor man's version but yeah the only you're missed out is of

51:20

course the upper body part but if you kind of like do a little like spin classy style stand up and you know push yourself up and down the bars a few

51:27

times or maybe do some push-ups during the recovery sessions on the Carol bike you can you can get pretty close to it

51:33

so yeah what about uh what about red light therapy besides your infrared sauna are you doing much with that or I

51:39

I have a ju I probably also bought that under your recommendation in fact I

51:44

think at one point my house might have looked like a showroom for the Ben recommends page I hear that a lot

51:50

particularly from pissed off spouses whose husbands or wives are spending way too much of the monthly budget on something they heard about on my show so

51:57

I have my ju like right against my Carol bike so while I'm on the Carol bike I I will also have the ju on but I'll do a

52:04

separate ju session you know just just for the the red light treatment but yeah have you heard my interview with to with

52:10

Tom Inon yet from the centa cancer protocol clinic in Phoenix yes that's

52:16

what he does is is red light therapy about with exercise and oxygen mask and

52:22

and even you know I did it in the video folks can watch the video if you want and a full body electrical muscle stimulation suit and he's getting

52:29

incredible results with like 15 minutes of exercise a day in his patients wow but but the red light therapy he uses I

52:35

looked into it it's super powerful I I think it's north of $100,000 it's like this full like wraparound giant red

52:42

light unit that as soon as he flipped it on I could feel the heat I was sweating within like three minutes from the heat

52:47

from this thing they had a a bed at the biohacking conference I think it was uh

52:54

immortalis yeah the the immortal chamber that that one's ozone red light pmf

52:59

sound that's crazy that was I felt the heat from that immediately that was impressive yeah if anybody is listening

53:05

in and you're you like just Google the name of your town plus Immortal bed uh if there's one around you can get a

53:11

chance to try it it is it is definitely one of the most potent like full body

53:17

reboots I've ever experienced well Dave this is fascinating is there anything else that you wanted to bring up while I have you on the show you know any other

53:24

message that you want to get out to people well you know it's it's funny I've I've had a couple different interviews with some really young like

53:31

20 year-old hosts and um one of the things I I tell them is that if they're

53:36

really looking to longevity and to live long the thing they need to consider is

53:41

they have to be able to fund that at some point they're not going to want to work forever so if they want to live

53:47

forever or they want to live to 120 or Beyond they got to start saving money

53:53

they got to start investing in like their 401k or their Ira now while they're super young and let that

53:59

compounding really build up because it's gonna make a huge difference to them by the time they're my age it does yeah

54:06

it's it's investment in time like I you know I spent so many years you know I started Green Field Fitness Systems from

54:12

my garage and that eventually became Keon and you know I took my first distribution what we start that like

54:17

seven years ago from Keon it was like the first time that I'd had like a sizable distribution from a company that

54:26

that that I had created and that was now kicking off actual you know reasonable

54:32

Capital my way you know even though I've got a portfolio of maybe over 25

54:37

different health and fitness companies right now right that that's that's uh what do you call it rich on paper poor

54:44

on cash or whatever it's like yeah that that's not all liquidable but you know all of those tiny tiny little checks

54:50

that I wrote along the years eventually those will start to materialize and companies will sell and you know and

54:56

that money will start to come in but yeah thinking in the long game it's the same lesson I teach my sons you know

55:01

they do an investment into their their Roth IRA you know each year they

55:06

maximize contributions to that you know they they work on their business they invest time and you know that that was

55:12

you know me from you know age 13 I've always been a saver you know usually saved gosh more than 80% of what I made

55:19

since a very young age and yeah definitely compounds and you know allows you to to live the life you want but it

55:26

takes patience right for me I'm 42 now I probably didn't feel like full clo close

55:33

to like being financially comfortable until I was maybe 35 or 36 and that and

55:38

so that was you know like at least 22 years of saving investing and literally working you know typically 60 to 70

55:45

hours a week to get to that point well Dave I'm G to put the links to

55:51

everything we talked about my other interview with Julie who I know your friends with uh my interview with Bill
