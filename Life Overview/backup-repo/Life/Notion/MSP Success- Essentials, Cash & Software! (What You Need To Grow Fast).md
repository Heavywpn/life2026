how much money do you actually need to  
start an MSP business but not only that  
but what having an extra cash injection  
whether that's from an investor or a  
loan actually help you grow the business  
I dive into the pros and the cons of  
that in this video before I get into it  
my name is Harrison Baron from growth  
generators. we help msps with sales  
training and marketing before I get into  
today's video I do have to mention two  
quick things as always number one there  
is pricing training down below with a  
calculator that'll help you get  
significantly more profitable or launch  
your MSP business with a right numbers  
so that you know you're not losing money  
every single month second is come hang  
out with us in the Discord it is well  
past 300 people and consistently growing  
everyone from just starting out to the  
seven and eight figure earners in there  
I love hanging out there and this video  
idea came from the Discord so if you  
have a question or you want me to make a  
video come hang out it's a fantastic  
group of people to get in there it is  
growth  
generators. Discord so let's talk about  
money and let's talk about what you  
actually need to get into business and  
start your MSP business model now the  
MSP business is all about providing a  
proactive service and sometimes reactive  
but mainly a proactive service every  
single month and in return clients will  
send you money every single month that's  
the best part about it they want to make  
sure that they are operating efficiently  
month after month after month and  
they're willing to pay to make sure that  
they don't have to deal with the  
headaches and their business runs as  
smooth as possible so what do you  
actually need to go start an MSP well  
one you probably need to subscribe to  
this Channel and maybe even hit that  
like button and that little notification  
Bell but also there's some software that  
you absolutely have to have when you go  
out and start a business the first thing  
even before the software is you have to  
incorporate now here in the states the  
United States you need to go out and  
create some kind of legal entity for a  
business that could be an S corp a C  
Corp an LLC you so proprietorship  
whatever it is that fits you if you're  
not sure do a little bit of homework  
find an accountant or find a lawyer they  
will help guide you through that process  
now after you go through that and I know  
that there's a similar kind of thing  
that you have to follow in other  
countries but after you follow that you  
need your tools you got to be able to do  
the work and with that you need tools  
you need an rmm tool a PSA tool a remote  
managing and monitoring tool a  
Professional Services automation tool  
sorry a lot of acronyms here personally  
one of my favorites is Su Ops there will  
be a link down below and you could go  
through and grab it now it's a fantastic  
all-in-one platform they do have some AI  
in there it's a nice Sleek user  
interface and one of the best things in  
my opinion is they are extremely  
competitively priced you can get an rmm  
tool and a PSA tool as you see here for  
the whopping total of  
$119 a month this is going to basically  
allow you to do the work now you can  
bootstrap it and there are other much  
cheaper alternatives that video is  
coming soon but for a great tool at a  
great price in my opinion 119 bucks will  
get you get you started in the right  
direction after that you're going to  
need something to back it up doing maybe  
even a little bit of cyber security I  
personally love acronis it's a fantastic  
platform it's a lot of per storage as  
you so choose and I would recommend at  
least contacting them and getting that  
ball rolling now there are some other  
things that you don't necessarily have  
to have but are really smart to have  
number one is an accounting software you  
got to have something whether it's  
QuickBooks or zero xer o you're going to  
need those for about I don't know 35 to  
40 bucks and we'll check out that  
pricing here you could see here between  
$15 and $100 a month you can go on and  
get QuickBooks and this is going to keep  
you accountable and it'll show you your  
expenses going out your money coming in  
it'll show you your profit loss sheets  
it is really really important to have  
that so between your super Ops currently  
and your QuickBooks you're looking at  
about  
$160 a month depending on what package  
you actually get now I do recommend a  
CRM or marketing platform or both this  
in my opinion go high level is one of  
the absolute best I have tons of msps  
that are currently using it I use it for  
my own business it is a gigantic  
platform it is really really good and in  
my opinion it just does everything that  
you're going to need it to do you can  
send out contracts on there you can send  
bills out on there and you can start  
getting paid it costs a whopping $97 a  
month and we have a link down here for  
the $97 so now you're at about 230 to  
250 per month which is really not that  
bad the last and final thing that you  
really need is insurance and there is a  
company called the brunsman group they  
specialize in MSP and cyber insurance  
they speak all the lingo I did an  
interview with Joe brunsman the owner of  
the company a little while back those  
videos will be coming out in the very  
very near future but I didn't even  
realize how crazy it actually is to have  
insurance and I will leave their link  
down below all of these links will be  
down below so you can go get quick  
access to them so now that we've kind of  
covered that let's talk a little bit  
about having cash in your business and  
realistically all of those you're  
probably at a pocket somewhere in the  
vicinity of about $250 so for the small  
price of 250 bucks a month you can  
actually go do the work you should get  
insurance it'll vary on a case-by casee  
basis figure about $100 per month for  
insurance 350 bucks so what else right  
we have we've talked about these tools  
you're probably going to need some level  
of antivirus and as you bring on new  
customers you'll be able to sell that as  
well between $2 and $5 per machine but  
it's really a negligible amount of money  
at that point so how does having cash in  
the business actually help well cash is  
like fuel on the fire in this case we'll  
use gasoline on the fire right it makes  
it and grows that fire to a roaring fire  
right it just grows and by putting it on  
there goes up and that's exactly what  
cash actually does for the business so  
what are some pros and cons that people  
have with this and why is it really  
important whether you have cash or don't  
have cash well cash like I said it is  
that fuel to the fire it's going to help  
it grow quite a bit but a lot of  
companies don't think about the biggest  
problem that they actually have and  
that's who to do business with because  
cash is fantastic cash will allow you to  
run ants it allow you to meet certain  
people it allow you to get into certain  
events it does quite a bit for your  
business it allows you to hire better  
Talent it allows you to hire better  
lawyers and accountants and everybody in  
there give better pension plans for  
better retention all of these things  
actually matter and can actually be  
resolved with cash but the problem that  
most msps have is even if they have a  
$100,000 that they're sitting on or  
hundreds of thousand dollars that  
they're sitting on they fail at this one  
thing and that's knowing who their  
Target customer actually is so going  
through the buyer Persona is really  
really really important now there is a  
link down below for this but when I talk  
to msps from six and seven figures all  
the way down to them just starting the  
most common thing I see over and over  
and over again is people don't actually  
know who they need to do business with  
and that's what this buyer Persona is  
it's putting down your dream client on a  
piece of paper that's their first name  
their last name it could be completely  
made up their age range of what you  
think it would be what gender they are  
the Loc of them what job title what  
industry they're a part of the education  
level and all of these their  
psychographics Hobbies activities all of  
these help you pinpoint exactly who you  
want to do business with because once  
you know who you want to do business  
with cash can then start solving a lot  
of these problems even if you don't know  
or don't have the cash knowing exactly  
who to Target solves most of every MSP  
business's problems see they don't know  
who they need to go after if you can do  
business with anybody you can't really  
do business with anybody I know it  
sounds counterintuitive but hear me out  
right let's say I handed you $225,000  
let's call it you know what $50,000 I  
said you can only buy one car and it can  
only serve one  
function what would that car be some of  
you might say hey you know what I would  
love to have a brand new sports car I  
want to go real fast some of you might  
say you know what I'd really like to  
have a pickup truck but see the thing is  
is you can't do both in both cars you  
can't move a lot of stuff in a sports  
car and you can't really go that fast in  
a pickup truck maybe if it's a cyber  
truck but you have to think about it  
like that if you don't know who you're  
going to do business with and how you're  
actually going to be able to go out and  
service those clients month after month  
so that they can pay you you really  
can't do much with the cash that you're  
going to get whether that's from a loan  
or from an investor you need to know  
exactly who you're going to do business  
with go get that P Persona sheet and go  
through it but let me take it a little  
bit step further because I said cash is  
fuel to the fire and there's some cons  
to getting cash from outside sources see  
when most msps start they don't actually  
they they know what they want to start  
they've been through the videos and  
they've probably subscribed like you  
should to this video and hit that like  
button and all the good stuff but here's  
the thing most people that are starting  
an MSP have never ran r a business they  
don't understand what an sop a standard  
operating procedure is how to train  
employees how to actually go out and  
build the business who to Target how to  
have that insurance how business  
operations should run where they're  
going to go find their customers now the  
buyer Persona helps with a lot of this  
but if you're going out even if you have  
somebody that says hey I'll give you all  
the money in the world I'll give you  
$300,000 to start your business tomorrow  
well we just went over it probably cost  
about 350 bucks a month and they're  
going to give you this ton of money well  
that's great but if you don't actually  
know how to run a business that cash  
doesn't do anything it's fuel to the  
fire You by going out starting the  
business going through that process is  
the start of the actual business and as  
you progressively learn do over and over  
and over again all of a sudden things  
start to work magically in your favor  
and that's the most beautiful part about  
it is things will start to click and  
work that you never thought were  
actually going to happen once you have  
that taking cash is not a bad idea but  
there are some Cons with getting a cash  
injection into your business number one  
is if it's a loan they're going to want  
that money back and usually if you take  
money they want interest just the way  
nature of the Beast and the way the  
cookie crumbles it doesn't matter where  
you get that loan from a reputable bank  
or anybody else they want to make money  
on their money just like you want to  
make money so by taking a loan or taking  
money from an investor they want their  
money back at some point and money on  
their money now what if you got a  
partner or somebody that was interested  
in being a part of the business well  
guess what you're now selling a piece of  
your business and giving it to them in  
exchange for cash now the smaller the  
business usually the less cash you need  
and the bigger the business the more  
cash you actually need but are you  
comfortable with giving away a piece of  
that company what you negotiate with  
whomever ever it might be is totally up  
to you but you have to be comfortable  
with saying hey you know what if I want  
that cash and I don't want to have to  
pay it back I probably going to slice  
off 25 50 75% of that company whatever  
you're comfortable with and whatever you  
agree upon but that's a huge risk that  
not everybody wants to take some people  
like to Own 100% of their business and  
they don't want to have to deal with  
partners and that's fantastic but some  
people hey they're okay with having  
partners they don't want to be  
responsible for paying off that cash but  
at the same time every single month you  
have to give a small piece of that cash  
to that partner as you would take some  
money yourself they're entitled to a  
piece of it because they bought a piece  
of the company that's the major  
difference with having an investor or  
cash involved in the business you have  
to fully understand who you're going to  
Target how you're going to Target it  
getting the tools that we just went over  
and these are some of the tools there's  
plenty of other Alternatives out there  
but getting those tools and  
understanding how to go run a business  
is  
vitally important after that getting  
that cash to add fuel to that fire and  
helping it grow that's the gold but you  
have to be able to put that spark out  
there first and start a smoldering fire  
and getting that thing going before you  
ever take cash some people hey if you've  
already done the the MSP thing and you  
know exactly how to run an MSP starting  
with cash is going to give you a massive  
leg up but the vast majority of people  
have never ran a business before let  
alone an MSP a service-based  
business and because of that it might  
not take make sense for you to get cash  
you might have to bite the bullet go out  
get your first client go buy all the  
software say hey I'm going to spend $300  
or $400 a month get the right stuff then  
go out and service that client and when  
everything starts to work correctly you  
build out your standard operating  
procedures you build out the processes  
that your team has to follow you learn  
to run the business then getting cash  
could absolutely 100% make your business  
grow like a wildfire that's the big  
difference so if you found this video
