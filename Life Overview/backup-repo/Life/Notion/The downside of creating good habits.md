> ==**Habits create the foundation for mastery**==

  

==**Each chunk of information that is memorized opens up the mental space for more effortful thinking**==

  

==**When you know the simple movements so well that you can perform them without thinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced details**==

  

> ==**Habits are the backbone of any pursuit of excellence**==

  

==**However the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. you fall into mindless repetition. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better**==

  

==**The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. the downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors. You assume you’re getting better because you’re gaining experience. In reality, you are merely reinforcing your current habits, not improving them**==

  

==**The less energy you spend on trivial choices, the more you can spend it on what really matters.**==

  

==**However, when you want to maximize your potential and achieve elite levels of performance, you need a more nuanced approach. You can’t repeat the same things blindly and expect to become exceptional.**==

  

> ==**Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery**==

  

==**What you need is a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice**==

  

==**Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery**==

  

==**To become great, certain skills do need to become automatic**==

  

==**But after one habit has been mastered, you have to return to the effortful part of the work and begin building the next habit.**==

  

==**Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development**==

  

==**Each habit unlocks the next level of performance. It’s an endless cycle**==

==**It is precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like you have mastered a skill, right when things are starting to feel automatic and you are becoming comfortable, that you must avoid slipping into the trap of complacency**==

### How to review your habits and make adjustments

  

==**Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement**==

  

==**Improvement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about fine-tuning them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary**==

  

==**You don’t want to keep practicing a habit if it becomes ineffective**==

  

==**Annual review:**==

1. ==**Tally your habits for the year**==
2. ==**Reflect on your progress**==
3. ==**Answer the following questions:**==
    1. ==**What went well this year?**==
    2. ==**What didn’t go so well this year?**==
    3. ==**What did I learn?**==

  

==**Six months later do an integrity report. Reflect on your identity and how you can work toward being the type of person I wish to become. Answer the following 3 questions:**==

1. ==**What are the core values that drive my life and work?**==
2. ==**How am I living and working with integrity right now?**==
3. ==**How can I set a higher standard in the future?**==

  

==**Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture. There is too much feedback. Conversely, never reviewing your habits is like never looking in the mirror**==

  

==**Finally, reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of the most important aspects of behaviour change: identity**==

### How to break the beliefs that hold you back

  

==**In the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of your desired identity**==

  

==**When working against you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly growing. This is one of the greatest downsides of building habits**==

  

==**The more sacred an idea is to us, that is the more deeply it is tied to our identity, the more strongly we will defend it against criticism**==

  

> ==**The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it**==

  

==**One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are**==

  

> ==**Keep your identity small**==

  

==**The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you**==

  

==**The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes**==

  

==**An identity can be flexible rather than brittle. Like water flowing around an obstacle, your identity works with the changing circumstances rather than against them.**==

  

_**Tao Te Ching:**_

_Men are born soft and supple;_  
_dead, they are stiff and hard._  
_Plants are born tender and pliant;_  
_dead, they are brittle and dry._  
_Thus whoever is still and inflexible_  
_is a disciple of death._  
_Whoever is soft and yielding_  
_is a disciple of life._  
_The hard and stiff will be broken._  
_The soft and supple will prevail._  
  
_- Lao Tzu_

  

==**Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you.**==

  

> ==**A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote**==
