You need to deploy it.  <br>00:00:03.360 Not only is it free and open source,which I don't know how that's possible,  <br>00:00:06.570 but you're gonna learn so much abouthacking and security while also protecting  <br>00:00:10.500 your stuff. It's a no-brainer.  <br>00:00:11.760 I deployed the server in about fiveminutes and then deployed agents to all of  <br>00:00:15.066 my computers and servers,Mac, windows, Lennox.  <br>00:00:17.670 Now these agents are like the tattletalesin school. They tell me everything.  <br>00:00:21.270 Things like security configurationare all my devices misconfigured?  <br>00:00:24.240 I don't know, but I do Now it'll checkfor known vulnerabilities, malware,  <br>00:00:27.660 and then this is kind of nuts.  <br>00:00:28.950 It can track a directory and see if anychanges occurred, files added removed,  <br>00:00:33.090 documents edited, andthis is even crazier.  <br>00:00:35.100 It can track the changes to theWindows registry. Are you kidding me?  <br>00:00:38.130 It's amazing.  <br>00:00:38.820 So all these devices send all theinformation to my server and I can see  <br>00:00:42.030 everything from onelocation. I get alerts,  <br>00:00:44.430 which can come at me viaemail or Slack or whatever.  <br>00:00:46.800 I can do things in response tothose alerts. Active response.  <br>00:00:49.775 So not only can I detect a brute forceattack, I can do something about it.  <br>00:00:53.490 Block that IP, address. Thisserver or this tool is called waza.  <br>00:00:56.910 It's a type of cybersecuritytool called asim,  <br>00:00:59.190 security Information and Event Management.But I so badly wanna call it a siem.  <br>00:01:03.360 I'm gonna call it a siem. I don't care.  <br>00:01:04.800 This type of tool is what the blue teamor defensive side of cybersecurity will  <br>00:01:08.340 use to defend against the bad guys tostop the hackers. So on this video,  <br>00:01:11.910 I'm gonna show you how to deploy thiscuz you need to. It's amazing. Again,  <br>00:01:15.390 not only will you beprotecting your stuff,  <br>00:01:17.340 but you're gonna learn so much and it'salso kind of addicting. And seriously,  <br>00:01:21.210 this is something you could probably puton your resume. This is a project like,  <br>00:01:24.060 hey, I run my own seam,sim seam seam seams.  <br>00:01:28.740 Pretty cool, doesn't it? ,I That was lame. I'm sorry.  <br>00:01:31.830 So you're convinced, let's talk aboutwhat you need. Really only two things.  <br>00:01:34.740 A Linux server or computer and somethingto monitor. So other computers,  <br>00:01:39.570 most flavors of Lennox are supported.I'll be installing it on Ubuntu.  <br>00:01:42.840 And more specifically, I'll be on a cloudmachine in ano. That's what I prefer.  <br>00:01:46.860 So I can monitor everything withease and also it's ridiculously easy.  <br>00:01:50.520 I'll walk you through it here ina bit. But it can also be on-prem,  <br>00:01:53.010 on a server you already have. Orit can be on a Docker container.  <br>00:01:55.770 Lemme get some room here, alreadygot a room, scoot down. There we go.  <br>00:01:58.680 And they even have an ova foreasy deployment on virtual box.  <br>00:02:01.740 Now as far as systemrequirements for the Wza server,  <br>00:02:04.290 lemme show you what theyrecommend. At minimum,  <br>00:02:06.120 they want two gigs of RAM and two CPUcores. That'll work for most people.  <br>00:02:10.080 If you got a lot of devices, if you'regonna be collecting lots of logs,  <br>00:02:12.395 you wanna go larger. Four gigs ofRam and eight CPU cores. Now again,  <br>00:02:16.320 I'm gonna walk you through the cloudoption and then also sprinkle in a little  <br>00:02:19.110 bit of dog or two just for fun. Oh,almost forgot the most important thing.  <br>00:02:22.260 Coffee. Everything in it requirescoffee. It's just the rules.  <br>00:02:27.900 Network.  <br>00:02:28.110 Chuck.coffee first. All we'll setup. Waza or wsu, I'm not sure.  <br>00:02:31.230 I'm just gonna call it waza in the cloud.  <br>00:02:33.065 So let's head on over to [od.com/networkchuck](http://od.com/networkchuck) or check the link below.  <br>00:02:37.350 Now not only is LY nodethe sponsor of this video,  <br>00:02:39.540 but they are my favorite cloud provider.Like I'm not lying, check this up.  <br>00:02:42.450 I have way too many virtual machines inthe cloud because I just go in here and  <br>00:02:46.050 spin up something.Anytime I have a project,  <br>00:02:47.940 anytime I wanna mess withsomething, I just go to LE Node,  <br>00:02:50.460 spin up a quick virtual machine inseconds. Now if you're new to LE Node,  <br>00:02:53.760 this is gonna be free foryou. For the first 60 days,  <br>00:02:56.010 they're gonna give you $100 creditto go crazy and play around with it.  <br>00:02:59.140 So if you haven't already,  <br>00:02:59.920 go ahead and get signed up right nowand then get signed in and meet me back  <br>00:03:02.950 here.  <br>00:03:03.280 Now the other reason I love Le Node isthey make deploying virtual machines like  <br>00:03:06.130 waza. Super stinking easy. Check thisout. I'm gonna go to create Lin node.  <br>00:03:09.730 I'll click on Marketplace and thenI'll search for waza. There it is.  <br>00:03:13.390 Let's go and click on that and justhave it selected and we'll scroll down a  <br>00:03:16.215 bit.  <br>00:03:16.420 Now time for just a little bit of configFirst put an email address then for the  <br>00:03:19.810 SSL certificate. Then a limitedpseudo user account, Bernard hack.  <br>00:03:23.410 Well this can beanything. Just make it up.  <br>00:03:24.940 Put a password in and we'll scrolldown just a little bit until we see.  <br>00:03:28.600 Select an image. We'reusing Ubuntu Perfect region.  <br>00:03:31.450 Select somewhere close toyou. Leno is a cloud provider.  <br>00:03:33.430 So they have data centers everywhere.  <br>00:03:35.080 Pick somewhere close to you so it'llbe nice and fast. I'm in Dallas.  <br>00:03:37.960 And finally our LE node plan. Fromhere, let's click on share. At cpu,  <br>00:03:41.080 they're cheaper. And here we have ourplans or the size of our virtual machine.  <br>00:03:44.440 Now normally I would pick this oneright here. It's five bucks a month,  <br>00:03:47.320 super cheap. But for waza, you wantsomething a bit beefier, a bit bigger,  <br>00:03:51.010 something more like theLE node, four gigabyte.  <br>00:03:52.870 Now if you don't select the four gigabyteoption for this WASA installation,  <br>00:03:56.380 it just won't work. I tried [it.So](http://it.so/) just make sure you select this.  <br>00:03:59.530 Now if you do wanna go for a smalleroption, like the LE node, two gigabyte,  <br>00:04:02.470 I actually got that working withDocker and it worked pretty well.  <br>00:04:05.170 I'll walk you through that here in asecond. Well, let's go ahead and do this.  <br>00:04:07.390 It's really not much more. It'sso easy. So select four gigabyte.  <br>00:04:10.330 Scroll down just a bit, labelthis sucker, whatever you want.  <br>00:04:14.140 Enter a root password.  <br>00:04:15.280 And finally we'll scroll down and clickon create LE node at the bottom right.  <br>00:04:18.790 Ready, set, go. Nowit's gonna do its thing.  <br>00:04:21.250 It's gonna bake you a VM inthe cloud. Quick coffee break,  <br>00:04:26.410 it'll be a few minutes. And once yousee that your LE node is running,  <br>00:04:29.830 we can try and connect to it. Overhere we have our SSH access command.  <br>00:04:32.980 We're gonna go ahead and copy thisright here and then launch your terminal  <br>00:04:35.770 Windows, Mac and Linux. It'll allwork. And paste that in there. Enter,  <br>00:04:39.340 accept all fingerprints. Putyour password in and we're in.  <br>00:04:42.550 But it may not be quite ready. Waza isstill going through its installation.  <br>00:04:46.060 We can monitor it kind of rightnow by typing in H top H T O P.  <br>00:04:50.530 And we'll see right at the top there,the top process. D P K G or D package.  <br>00:04:55.000 That's how apps on Linux are installedand that's what's happening right now.  <br>00:04:58.240 So we can kinda sit there andwatch that until that stops.  <br>00:05:00.645 And we can try to connect herein a moment and like see here,  <br>00:05:02.470 we have some wza stuff there. TheWZA index year is being installed.  <br>00:05:05.770 There's a bunch of pieces toit. It's amazing. But again,  <br>00:05:07.780 quick coffee break andwatch the magic happen.  <br>00:05:11.020 Now at this point it's been aboutsix minutes. Let's see if it's done.  <br>00:05:13.930 And we'll start with grabbingour password. By the way,  <br>00:05:16.090 I hit control C to get out of that,  <br>00:05:17.560 if we type in LS dash aland our terminal here,  <br>00:05:20.590 we should see a dot deploymentdash secrets dot txc file.  <br>00:05:24.670 There it has our secrets or ourpasswords. Let's go ahead and cap that.  <br>00:05:27.430 Cats dot deployment secrets,blah blah. Got it. Bam.  <br>00:05:30.280 There's our passwords right there.  <br>00:05:31.360 The first one we want is theadmin password at the top.  <br>00:05:33.580 Got our admin username and our adminpassword. Cool, keep that there.  <br>00:05:36.880 Let's go back to ourLE node dashboard here.  <br>00:05:38.650 And we're gonna grab our LE node reverseDNS name or R D N S. So here Leno node.  <br>00:05:42.880 Click on the network tab.  <br>00:05:44.170 Scroll down just a little bit untilwe see the IP addresses section.  <br>00:05:47.830 And then we have the reverse DNS righthere. There it is. Just go and grab that,  <br>00:05:51.850 copy it.  <br>00:05:52.600 Open a new tab and go to https colonwhack whack paste that in .  <br>00:05:57.650 Here we go. It's there. Now let's getlogged in. Use your name admin password.  <br>00:06:01.700 Let's grab that from the terminalthere. It's copy and paste.  <br>00:06:05.870 It's gonna check and make sure thingsare good. Almost there or good. Awesome.  <br>00:06:09.560 This seems pretty cool. Last timeI'll do that joke. Probably not.  <br>00:06:13.310 Seems like a ock. Sorry .It's terrible. Now before we move on,  <br>00:06:17.180 I'm gonna show the dockerinstall. It's super easy.  <br>00:06:19.910 If you don't care about that,that's fine. Just skip ahead.  <br>00:06:22.015 I've got timestamps below. Nowhere's the docker install. Perfect.  <br>00:06:24.800 Four on-prem or a smaller machine on LEnode, which is what I'll be doing here.  <br>00:06:28.790 Leno. I'm gonna click on create le node.  <br>00:06:30.620 I'll just deploy a standardUbuntu 2204 lts machine,  <br>00:06:35.300 shared cpu. I know that the LEnode, two gigabyte plan will work.  <br>00:06:38.990 I tried it on the one gig, the containersjust wouldn't run. Don't try it.  <br>00:06:42.260 But the two gig plan, it worked [great.So](http://great.so/) click that, label it something fun,  <br>00:06:45.560 put a password in and then click oncreate le node. How fast was that?  <br>00:06:49.340 Now if you're doing this on-prem,  <br>00:06:50.450 just have a server that's running Dockerand of course if you want to run the  <br>00:06:53.600 ova, I'll put a link below and wassdocumentation. After a moment or two,  <br>00:06:57.140 you should see that your machine isrunning. Let's go and connect to it.  <br>00:07:00.110 We'll grab our SSH access command overhere. Just copy that. Launch my terminal,  <br>00:07:03.830 paste it, head enter, accept allfingerprints, password. And we're in.  <br>00:07:07.730 Couple things we'll do real quick.First we'll update our repositories.  <br>00:07:10.250 Pseudo a P t update. Now many of you'regonna go, why is he doing pseudo?  <br>00:07:13.730 You're route. I always do pseudocause I don't know what you're using.  <br>00:07:17.330 You may not be root right now. I justwanna make it simple. Anyways, I digress.  <br>00:07:21.650 Pseudo PT update to update ourrepositories. Once that finishes up,  <br>00:07:24.830 we'll do a pseudo PT andinstall [docker.io](http://docker.io/) and docker  <br>00:07:29.630 dash compose. We'll doa dash y at the end.  <br>00:07:32.420 This is going to install dockerand Docker compose. So let's go.  <br>00:07:35.420 Should be fairly quick. More of a coffeesip here. Awesome, it is finished.  <br>00:07:39.650 The next step, I've got a link below.  <br>00:07:41.120 Go ahead and pull up the Wazadocumentation for a docker deployment.  <br>00:07:44.480 Well one two punch this real quick.  <br>00:07:45.800 First we'll clone the get repositoryone command. Let's copy that.  <br>00:07:49.100 Go back to your terminal, paste thatcommand assuming you have get installed.  <br>00:07:52.130 Most oss do clone. Awesome type in Ls.  <br>00:07:54.710 We'll see a new directorycalled waza Docker.  <br>00:07:56.960 Let's go ahead and CD into that cd,waza, Docker type in LS once more.  <br>00:08:01.280 And we have one moredirectory we wanna jump into.  <br>00:08:03.650 It's the single node directory becausewe're deploying one single node or  <br>00:08:07.250 computer cd single node. Perfect.  <br>00:08:10.520 Now the next thing we'll have to do isgenerate some self sign certificates.  <br>00:08:13.880 They make that super easy for us.  <br>00:08:15.145 They even have a Docker composefile to run and do that for us.  <br>00:08:18.080 And all we have to do iscopy and paste this command.  <br>00:08:19.820 So copy this command right here,paste that in there, hit enter.  <br>00:08:23.810 It's gonna pull those images down.Run, compose. And then that was it.  <br>00:08:27.410 That's done. Now for our next step,  <br>00:08:28.880 all we have to do is do thedocker dash compose command  <br>00:08:33.740 with the up option. And then we'll do adash D to launch it in the background.  <br>00:08:37.730 This will do everything for us. Thisis our last step in deploying this.  <br>00:08:40.700 It's super easy. I love docker. Ready,set, go. This will take a moment.  <br>00:08:45.320 It's deploying a multi-tierapplication, pulling all the images,  <br>00:08:48.740 a lot of stuff going on. Little coffeebreak. We'll give it some time here.  <br>00:08:51.740 Okay, deployment is done, done, done.  <br>00:08:54.110 Let's confirm real quickby typing in docker stats.  <br>00:08:57.780 Get a realtime view of those suckersrunning. Let's go get logged in.  <br>00:09:00.930 Let's check it out. We'll getback to our Leno dashboard here.  <br>00:09:03.360 Go to the network tab. Scrolldown just a little bit,  <br>00:09:05.640 find our reverse DNS name righthere in the IP addresses section.  <br>00:09:09.690 Go ahead and copy that and we'llopen up a new tab. Type in https,  <br>00:09:13.200 colon whack whack, paste that inthere. Let's go. Fingers crossed. Okay,  <br>00:09:16.800 this is a self-signed cert. We'll getthis little error message. No big deal.  <br>00:09:19.710 Should proceed. Was that sorry. Um,this video has so many lame jokes.  <br>00:09:23.460 Let's get logged in. Default. Login willbe admin password will be according to.  <br>00:09:27.660 Was it documentation? Whatwas it? Was it ? Sorry.  <br>00:09:32.400 Sorry, not sorry. Oh, it's uh, secretpassword. Capital S. Capital P.  <br>00:09:36.360 Easy enough. Just gotta check and makesure things are good. Almost. Okay,  <br>00:09:40.200 things are good. Now thatwe have, was it installed?  <br>00:09:42.720 Let's get some agents added.Computers that we can monitor.  <br>00:09:45.150 So right here we'll click on addagent right here in the dashboard.  <br>00:09:48.330 And then right here we'll havethe option to deploy a new agent.  <br>00:09:51.330 Go ahead and click on that. Thisis super straightforward and easy.  <br>00:09:53.760 We'll start with theLinux host first. Again,  <br>00:09:55.410 I'm gonna do Ubuntu and we'll doa Windows after this. By the way,  <br>00:09:57.990 Ubuntu 15 or more architecture is X 86.  <br>00:10:01.170 But notice we have optionsfor everything. It's awesome.  <br>00:10:03.690 Then we'll put our was aserver address in here.  <br>00:10:05.520 This will simply be your LE node,  <br>00:10:06.930 reverse DNS name if you did it withme or it could be an IP address.  <br>00:10:09.480 Just something that the agent can haveaccess to. So I'll copy that server.  <br>00:10:12.660 Address the F Q D N fully qualifieddomain name just like this.  <br>00:10:16.770 I will name that agent. It's optionalbut I like to Callie underscore Linux.  <br>00:10:21.300 We'll select a group. I'llput it in the default group.  <br>00:10:23.460 And then on step six they give you onecommand to install the agent. Super cool.  <br>00:10:27.180 Super easy. Let's copy that. Copy command.  <br>00:10:29.190 And then here in Cali I'll launch myterminal. Paste that command head,  <br>00:10:32.340 enter pseudo password and it's done.Cool. One more thing we have to do,  <br>00:10:37.260 getting back to the was a dashboard.We need to enable this as a service.  <br>00:10:40.385 We'll just copy this. Commandall system, CTL commands,  <br>00:10:42.870 paste those commands in there,head enter and done. Awesome.  <br>00:10:46.410 So now getting back to the WASA dashboard.  <br>00:10:48.270 We can go to the top left here onthis drop down and click on agents.  <br>00:10:51.390 There it is right there. My first littleguy, Callie Lennox, his IP address os.  <br>00:10:56.310 And it's gonna show us so much more.Oh, I can't wait to show you this,  <br>00:10:59.135 but first, before we do that,let's add Windows real quick.  <br>00:11:01.260 But notice how fast and easy thisis and Windows. It's just as easy.  <br>00:11:04.020 Let's go ahead and douh, deploy new agent.  <br>00:11:06.000 Once more this time we'llclick on Windows. Goodness,  <br>00:11:08.790 they still have WindowsXP in here. .  <br>00:11:11.280 I guess you need a scenefor this man. But anyways,  <br>00:11:13.500 I'm on Windows seven or more orgreater. No Windows arm support, sad,  <br>00:11:16.950 fully qualified domain name would be oursame. I uh, domain name or IP address.  <br>00:11:20.700 Again, just something your agent can haveaccess to. I'll name it default group.  <br>00:11:24.330 And finally at step six, just like Linux,  <br>00:11:26.430 we're gonna have our littleone-liner command using PowerShell.  <br>00:11:29.280 Keeping in mind you will need to runthis as administrator cause you will need  <br>00:11:32.580 admin privileges. So I'lljust copy that command,  <br>00:11:34.680 jump into my Windows computer here.  <br>00:11:36.870 So here in Windows I'lllaunch my Windows terminal.  <br>00:11:38.850 Keeping in mind I'll haveto launch it as admin.  <br>00:11:40.740 So right click this and click on run asadministrator. Pace my command in there,  <br>00:11:44.430 hit enter. Gonna do its thing.And then one more command.  <br>00:11:47.010 We'll have to start theservice here on Windows.  <br>00:11:48.990 Just like Linux net start was a SVCwas a is starting and we're off to the  <br>00:11:53.410 races. Let's go check Waza, the Wazadashboard. We'll go to our agents.  <br>00:11:56.710 Oh there it is. It's still coming up.  <br>00:11:58.330 Let's click on refresh over here onthe right. Refresh, refresh, refresh.  <br>00:12:01.420 Come on. Connect. I'm impatient.And after a billion refreshes. No,  <br>00:12:04.240 I'm just kidding. It was likethree. Um, it's up. Awesome.  <br>00:12:07.120 And here's our two machines at Lennoxand Windows. And you know what,  <br>00:12:10.540 I wanna add one morejust for fun. Ready Go.  <br>00:12:14.050 It was seriously actuallyalmost that fast.  <br>00:12:16.090 So here we have our agents and now let'sclick on one of these and see what's  <br>00:12:19.150 going on. This is gonna be [fun.So](http://fun.so/) I'm gonna click on the new one.  <br>00:12:21.280 I just added the Circs network. Chuck,that's from my CIRCS search video.  <br>00:12:25.780 It's a public box and it'sgonna be kind of fun to look at.  <br>00:12:28.065 It's click on that guy. And here's ouragent dashboard for this one computer,  <br>00:12:31.360 this one server. There's a lot going on.  <br>00:12:33.100 But just keep in mindat the top here in Waza,  <br>00:12:34.720 we kind of have breadcrumbsand I love this.  <br>00:12:36.520 We've got agents and we're drilled downinto the specific agent we're looking  <br>00:12:39.645 at. And then here at thedashboard, so much going on.  <br>00:12:42.430 Now I'm not gonna show youeverything. There's way too much,  <br>00:12:44.530 way too much fun to be had.  <br>00:12:45.705 But I will point out a fewthings that are like kind of wow.  <br>00:12:48.250 First the Mitre framework.The Mitre attack framework.  <br>00:12:51.340 We won't go too deep into this,  <br>00:12:52.510 but just know it's a database of hackingtechniques that hackers will use to  <br>00:12:55.720 attack machines. This will look atthat framework and tell you, Hey,  <br>00:12:59.710 your machine might be vulnerable to this,  <br>00:13:01.840 these tactics or your machine isactively being attacked in these ways.  <br>00:13:06.190 And notice, um, some thingsare happening to mine.  <br>00:13:08.470 We'll take a look at those here ina bit. And then quick drive by here.  <br>00:13:11.350 Compliance. Many companies have to obeycertain compliance standards like pci,  <br>00:13:15.145 gdpr, nist, hipaa. This willcheck all your computers,  <br>00:13:18.580 all your servers and tell you what'sgoing on. That's kind of crazy. Now,  <br>00:13:22.270 you may not care about policies. Youshould if you wanna get into security,  <br>00:13:25.000 but it may not be important foryou right now. Scroll down a bit.  <br>00:13:27.100 What about configuration? Is your serveror your computer configured securely?  <br>00:13:30.490 Do you know that for a fact?Well this will tell you .  <br>00:13:33.070 It has a module called SCAor secure configuration.  <br>00:13:36.370 I think it's audit or assessment,secure configuration assessment.  <br>00:13:39.610 And it will pull out a C I S assessment.  <br>00:13:42.040 This is for buntu Linux andtell you how good you are. Um,  <br>00:13:44.770 39% on my score failed 715 of these.  <br>00:13:48.040 Now let me give you like kind ofa baseline for what that means.  <br>00:13:50.020 Let's jump into this report.Notice here in the breadcrumbs,  <br>00:13:52.000 I did jump into the security configurationassessment section and it'll tell me  <br>00:13:55.480 all the things I failed at. Let meactually sort by. Uh, good stuff.  <br>00:13:58.750 It's gonna be a small list. Andmost of this is like default.  <br>00:14:00.970 So like App Armor is installed cool,  <br>00:14:03.010 but it'll go deeper and tell you thingslike hey you should disable USB storage.  <br>00:14:05.860 If that drill down to SSH cuz you cansearch for specific things like that.  <br>00:14:08.740 Keyword . It'll tell me thingslike, hey don't install Telenet.  <br>00:14:11.860 U F W is not enabled.Disable ssh sh root login.  <br>00:14:14.920 So not only is it showingyou like hey you're insecure,  <br>00:14:17.080 but it's also teaching you. Causeif I click on any one of these,  <br>00:14:19.420 it'll tell me like, Heyhere's the rationale, here'swhy we're telling you this.  <br>00:14:22.360 Here's how you fix it,here's how you check it.  <br>00:14:24.520 And then it shows you all the miretechniques that can be used against having  <br>00:14:27.765 that misconfiguration. That's sofreaking powerful. Are you kidding me?  <br>00:14:31.270 It's okay, I'm getting a littleexcited coffee, you'll calm me down.  <br>00:14:35.440 That's just one module speed mode. Let'sget back to our agent dashboard here.  <br>00:14:38.890 Here on the menu we have security eventsshowing you things like authentication  <br>00:14:41.800 failures, which could be brute forceattacks. It'll show you top five alerts.  <br>00:14:45.280 It'll give you a list ofsecurity alerts. Super powerful.  <br>00:14:47.890 And then here's something you're notgonna see right away. If I click on more,  <br>00:14:50.770 we have vulnerabilities.  <br>00:14:52.580 It'll check your system forvulnerabilities but it'snot enabled by default.  <br>00:14:55.400 I'll show you how to dothis here in a moment.  <br>00:14:57.230 But I have another system I alreadyhad up and running and if I look at  <br>00:14:59.870 vulnerabilities for that one,  <br>00:15:01.490 it's gonna check all myapplications and tell me like, Hey,  <br>00:15:04.310 are there known CBEs out thereor common vulnerabilities?  <br>00:15:07.640 And I've got a bunch likea lot. But just look at this,  <br>00:15:11.300 deploy this for your house or yourservers or whatever you have and play  <br>00:15:14.390 security admin. Go in here and go,oh wow, I've got 170 critical CDEs.  <br>00:15:18.680 I should go figure out how to fixthose. The learning opportunity.  <br>00:15:21.740 Are you kidding me? And then hereon my server I already had going.  <br>00:15:24.260 I do wanna show you one thing here on oneof my Windows hosts or Windows agents.  <br>00:15:28.400 This is kind of fun. I have my daughter'scomputer here, this is amazing.  <br>00:15:31.010 Check this out. I'll click on Chloe.  <br>00:15:32.720 And the one thing you're gonna loveabout Windows Host is the integrity  <br>00:15:36.170 monitoring module. Oh my gosh,thing's amazing. Check it out.  <br>00:15:39.830 The sucker's gonna monitor all theimportant files and registry keys that are  <br>00:15:44.360 normally modified whensomething's being hacked.  <br>00:15:46.400 It's gonna look at things and tellyou when things are being adjusted.  <br>00:15:48.830 So like check this out. If I go to events,  <br>00:15:50.570 it'll tell me each time aregister key is changed.  <br>00:15:52.550 Like this one was deleted firewallpolicy. I don't know why that happened.  <br>00:15:55.640 Now some of these are automatic,like the Windows OS is doing it,  <br>00:15:58.370 but others can be bad. It's gotta crazy.  <br>00:16:01.580 And it's not just registry keys.If I go to inventory over here,  <br>00:16:03.950 I can see that it hasinventory of the files,  <br>00:16:05.390 it's monitoring and all the registry keys,  <br>00:16:07.190 it's monitoring and what they'recurrently set to. Is it not insane?  <br>00:16:09.890 And here in a moment I'llshow you how you can s uh,  <br>00:16:11.575 monitor specific keys and get alerts onthose keys and files too. It's so fun.  <br>00:16:15.950 Now at this point your seamseems to be doing great. I lied,  <br>00:16:19.220 I was gonna do it one more [time.It](http://time.it/) seems to be doing pretty good.  <br>00:16:21.260 Pretty much all youhave to do is set it up,  <br>00:16:23.060 connect an agent to it and it collectsinformation and you can go crazy and  <br>00:16:26.750 learn cybersecurity andstart to protect your stuff.  <br>00:16:29.660 But you can also tinker with this quitea bit. You can enable more modules,  <br>00:16:32.690 set up more alerts, monitor morethings. So if you're interested in that,  <br>00:16:35.815 we're gonna walk througha few more options here.  <br>00:16:37.910 Now the first thing we'll do is lookat file monitoring through Windows.  <br>00:16:41.120 It's so powerful and so cool. Soback here at the WASA incense,  <br>00:16:44.810 I deployed with youright now in this video.  <br>00:16:46.700 Couple things real quick justbefore we jump into that.  <br>00:16:48.530 If I click on the home icon,  <br>00:16:49.610 it's gonna take me to the WASA dashboardand it's gonna show me like all the  <br>00:16:52.040 modules I could jump into. So for example,if I wanna jump into security events,  <br>00:16:55.340 it's gonna show me security events.  <br>00:16:56.480 But right now it's beingfiltered to look at one agent.  <br>00:16:59.030 I can unpin that to where it's showingme everything from every agent.  <br>00:17:02.270 That's pretty cool. And you can do thatwith most modules. Let's go back home.  <br>00:17:05.060 Now let's click on Waza oncemore. Will Waza drop down here?  <br>00:17:08.030 Let's click on agents. Now again,I'm not going over everything.  <br>00:17:10.940 Every little thing you can do and youdon't have to know all these things,  <br>00:17:13.520 but you can play aroundwith it. You can go crazy.  <br>00:17:16.310 I'm just giving you enough to getstarted and have a little bit of fun and  <br>00:17:18.710 things I got really excited [about.So](http://about.so/) let's click on agents here.  <br>00:17:21.170 We'll click on my Windows machine.  <br>00:17:22.640 A couple things I'm gonnashow you real quick.  <br>00:17:23.960 If I click on Integrity Monitoring,  <br>00:17:25.339 this is the module thatwe'll use to monitor files.  <br>00:17:28.160 Notice I don't have any events right now.  <br>00:17:29.540 I've got it filtered right now by thelast 24 hours and I've just connected this  <br>00:17:32.900 thing, nothing's happened.But if I go to the inventory,  <br>00:17:35.240 I can see that it already has scannedand inventoried all the default files.  <br>00:17:39.260 It'll look for in thedirectories. And my registry keys.  <br>00:17:41.600 I believe it's set to scaneverything every 12 hours.  <br>00:17:45.020 And if it notices a change, it'll letyou know. It'll alert you. Pretty cool.  <br>00:17:47.870 But with files we can also do realtime notification and rule set.  <br>00:17:51.450 Check this out.  <br>00:17:52.290 I'm gonna jump into my Windows host andchange some configuration for the agent  <br>00:17:55.830 file. Now you can find that here.I'm gonna go to my Windows Explorer,  <br>00:17:58.530 go to my C Drive, goto program files X 86.  <br>00:18:01.440 Now if this is all like weird foryou, like oh man Windows file system,  <br>00:18:03.990 I don't know what's going on.  <br>00:18:05.190 I do detail a lot of what this meansand how it's organized in my Windows  <br>00:18:08.910 Fundamentals course on my academy.Check it out, link below. Anyways,  <br>00:18:12.120 let's continue. It's an X 86 andin a folder called OS sec Agent,  <br>00:18:16.920 jump in there. Continue.You gotta have admin access.  <br>00:18:19.680 If I scroll down just a bit,I'll see a file named os [sec.com](http://sec.com/).  <br>00:18:23.430 That's your configurationfile for your agent.  <br>00:18:25.320 Let's go to open that with notepad.Open with notepad. Oh, by the way,  <br>00:18:28.920 you can do the same thing on Linux.I'll put documentation below.  <br>00:18:31.980 It's pretty much the same process, justediting the same type of agent file.  <br>00:18:35.430 But let's walk through thisreal quick here in this file,  <br>00:18:36.930 I'm just gonna search for sis checkto get to the SIS check section.  <br>00:18:41.760 That's hard to say.. And here right uh,  <br>00:18:44.100 you can see that I have the fileintegrity monitoring section.  <br>00:18:47.040 And you can see right here all thedirectories that is by default set to  <br>00:18:50.760 monitor.  <br>00:18:51.390 So what we'll do here is we'll justchoose a place amongst all these directory  <br>00:18:54.515 options and we'll add alittle configuration here.  <br>00:18:57.570 We'll type in directories and we'lladd an option that'll give us real time  <br>00:19:00.630 alerts. It's really simple what'scalled real time, just like that.  <br>00:19:04.025 Have it equal yes in quotes.  <br>00:19:05.310 We'll add one more optionreport underscore changes.  <br>00:19:08.400 Have that equal yes in quotes andwe'll add one more check underscore  <br>00:19:13.140 all and have that equal yes as well.  <br>00:19:15.780 So just to make sure we'reall on the same page here,  <br>00:19:17.370 we're specifying a directory and we'regiving it these options real time. Yes,  <br>00:19:21.150 report changes, yes. And checkall. Yes, we'll close that out.  <br>00:19:24.510 And then add the directory. We'regonna monitor with all these options.  <br>00:19:27.330 Let's see to our desktop.  <br>00:19:28.140 So we'll do CE colon slashusers slash your username.  <br>00:19:32.520 Mine is network check slash desktop.  <br>00:19:35.220 And then we'll close that out with aleft arrow forward slash directories just  <br>00:19:39.900 like this. So now we'llsave this file, file save.  <br>00:19:42.060 And then we'll restart the service bylaunching our terminal as administrator.  <br>00:19:44.940 Right click run as administratorand we'll say restart service.  <br>00:19:49.140 Dash name waza. [Cool.So](http://cool.so/) that should be good.  <br>00:19:52.140 So I'm gonna open up myWaza dashboard real quick.  <br>00:19:53.850 Make sure I'm on the events tab.Notice and look at the last 24 hours,  <br>00:19:57.060 nothing's happened. Let'schange something on our desktop.  <br>00:19:59.460 This is so cool and powerful. I hopethis illustrates how cool this is.  <br>00:20:02.250 She's gonna go to my desktop and I'mgonna add a new file, new text document.  <br>00:20:06.210 Can you see this? Just takeabout five seconds. One, two,  <br>00:20:10.830 let's take a look. Let'srefresh this. .  <br>00:20:15.030 There it is. No, it's weird.I said added, deleted, added.  <br>00:20:17.850 Oh I think because they changedthe name in real time. But look,  <br>00:20:20.070 it monitored that I add a new, uh, anew file. Um, check this out. So that's,  <br>00:20:23.190 that's one alert. If I change anythingabout it, let's open it up. Say, Hey,  <br>00:20:27.090 I'm changing stuff. We'll save it,we'll see if the new alert comes in.  <br>00:20:30.030 I'll refresh my optionshere or refresh my page.  <br>00:20:32.520 There it is sis check eventmodified. And it's like, Hey,  <br>00:20:35.670 the check sum changed on this.  <br>00:20:37.350 It'll even tell me down herewhat I changed the text Iadded. How crazy is that?  <br>00:20:41.880 Now we can do the same kind ofthing with the Windows registry.  <br>00:20:44.070 Now it won't be real time,they don't have that option,  <br>00:20:46.590 but it will scan every 12 hours.You can change that interval.  <br>00:20:49.300 Let me share real quick. We can [specify.So](http://specify.so/) right now Pilic was an inventory,  <br>00:20:53.170 right? We can see that it does havean inventory. Look at our new file.  <br>00:20:56.710 It does have an inventory of registeredkeys that automatically monitors,  <br>00:20:59.920 but we can add specific onesthat we want to have seen.  <br>00:21:02.050 So let's add a custom one real quick.  <br>00:21:03.460 I'll open up a red edit herein Windows to edit my registry.  <br>00:21:07.090 Let's add one inside. Uh, I don't know,hq, local machine. We'll go to software,  <br>00:21:11.440 maybe classes. And let's add oneright here, right click say New key,  <br>00:21:16.420 we'll say Bernard Hack. Well bam,  <br>00:21:20.080 we'll change the value to something fun.  <br>00:21:22.780 So what I'll do here is I'll right clickthis key and say copy key name and then  <br>00:21:26.590 we'll go back to ouragent configuration file.  <br>00:21:28.960 And you'll notice just under that samekind of section where we're adding  <br>00:21:31.660 directories, we also haveregistry keys we can add.  <br>00:21:34.240 So I'll go kind oftowards the bottom here,  <br>00:21:35.860 just underneath the last registry entryand right before the entry to ignore,  <br>00:21:41.590 I'll line myself up with everythingelse, type in Windows registry,  <br>00:21:46.390 paste my key name,  <br>00:21:47.680 and then close it out with a left arrowforward slash Windows registry and a  <br>00:21:51.730 right arrow. Cool, thatshould be all we need.  <br>00:21:54.100 And it'll change thefrequency cuz like I said,  <br>00:21:55.900 it's gonna take 12 hours to findthis. We don't want it to do that.  <br>00:21:59.110 So up here we have frequency that CIScheck is executed by default every 12  <br>00:22:03.280 hours. 43, 200.  <br>00:22:05.200 Let's change that from thatto 60. So every, every minute.  <br>00:22:10.060 Actually let's do 30 seconds. Let'sbe quick. So I'll save this file.  <br>00:22:14.290 I'll restart my service. My was aservice to once some more restart.  <br>00:22:17.410 Service name was a Got it go. Cool.  <br>00:22:19.570 So getting back to our WASA dashboardhere in our integrity monitoring section  <br>00:22:22.870 for our Windows machine.  <br>00:22:24.130 I'm gonna go over here to inventory andjust see if it finds that new registry  <br>00:22:26.800 key. I'll go to registry, I'll searchfor, what do we name it Bernard?  <br>00:22:31.660 Nothing yet. Way for it to findit. There it is right there.  <br>00:22:34.510 So it found the key. It's lookingat it, it's monitoring it. Cool.  <br>00:22:37.660 Now let's go to events. Now you seethat we've got some registry changes,  <br>00:22:40.600 mainly time and we're getting thatbecause we were setting it to every 30  <br>00:22:43.420 seconds. Notice nothing about aregistry key here. Let's go change it.  <br>00:22:46.210 Let's go modify it. Hammer Bernard, hack.  <br>00:22:47.805 Well I'll change the valueto something else. Fun  <br>00:22:52.930 or you got hacked. Cool, let's changeit there. It'll take about 30 seconds.  <br>00:22:57.280 Take a little coffee break andlet's monitor our was the dashboard.  <br>00:23:00.610 I'll refresh it a few times. And ohthere it is. Register key modified.  <br>00:23:04.540 How killer is that? Now you may bewondering, okay, big deal Chuck,  <br>00:23:07.870 I'll barely even know there.But when does registry is,  <br>00:23:09.615 why do I care if it'schanged? And first of all,  <br>00:23:11.260 the registry like has these settingsfor the configuration of your operating  <br>00:23:14.620 system. So if things are changedhere, it's changing everywhere else.  <br>00:23:17.860 Some common things you might seechanged, especially with malware.  <br>00:23:20.530 Is this key here? Does it seem MicrosoftWindows? Where's it at? Where's it at?  <br>00:23:25.450 Windows Current version. There'sa lot of keys in here man.  <br>00:23:28.480 And we have run and runonce these keys are changed,  <br>00:23:31.630 when you add like a new startupapplication for your system.  <br>00:23:33.910 So what malware will do is I'll go inhere and add a new key new string value.  <br>00:23:37.810 Call this, I'll call this bad stuff andI'll just say internet explorer .  <br>00:23:42.705 Let's, let's copy that location.Okay? And looking back at Waza,  <br>00:23:46.580 it does monitor that by default. Andhere in the events, if I refresh it,  <br>00:23:50.180 there it is. Registerkey added and modified.  <br>00:23:53.090 There's the name of it right there. Badstuff. That's pretty powerful, right?  <br>00:23:56.600 The next thing I wanna show you actions.They're so powerful. Check this out.  <br>00:24:00.530 Let's go to our agents here and I'lljump into my Linux machine here.  <br>00:24:04.070 Circs Network, Chuck. Now let's go tosecurity events and I'll jump to events.  <br>00:24:07.730 Now there'll be a lot of eventshere because this machine's public.  <br>00:24:10.010 Now I'm getting things like attemptto log in using a non-existent user.  <br>00:24:13.430 Getting Bruteforce from Russia usingthe user name Pie . That's funny.  <br>00:24:18.230 Anyways, we can do something with that.And actually I wanna try it myself.  <br>00:24:21.800 I'm gonna try in brute force,  <br>00:24:23.030 I'm gonna launch my Callie Linux machinehere and I'll use hydro to brute force  <br>00:24:26.270 the login and I'll use theusername, uh, Bernard Hack.  <br>00:24:29.185 Well and we'll see ifit sees us. Ready, set,  <br>00:24:32.150 go after a pseudo password. Herewe go. Okay, it's attacking.  <br>00:24:36.530 We should see a log. Let's go look atthe logs here. Security events. Events.  <br>00:24:40.760 This happened just now. Let'ssee if it was us. Use your name.  <br>00:24:44.330 Bernard Hack Wall. So there,there we are. How cool was that?  <br>00:24:46.910 Let's stop that nonsense. Let's realquick. See if I try to log into it. Okay,  <br>00:24:51.565 so I, I'm getting a passwordprompt so I'm not being blocked.  <br>00:24:53.960 So clearly I can sit here and just tryand try and try again to my heart's  <br>00:24:57.410 content.  <br>00:24:57.950 But what if I had our seam activelyrespond to that and add it to the block  <br>00:25:02.450 list, drop it, add it to the firewall.We can do that. Check it out.  <br>00:25:05.750 It's called active response, whichcan be used for so many things.  <br>00:25:08.480 But I wanna demo this realquick. Now, to change this,  <br>00:25:10.490 we're gonna go to theconfiguration of our was a server.  <br>00:25:13.040 So we're gonna go here to the was a menu,  <br>00:25:14.480 go to management and thenclick on configuration.  <br>00:25:17.150 From here we're gonna go to the topright and click on edit configuration.  <br>00:25:20.420 And we're gonna scroll down a bit untilwe see a section called active response.  <br>00:25:24.170 Actually, you know, why am I tripping?I'm just gonna search for it.  <br>00:25:25.910 Active response. Cool, thereit is. Active response.  <br>00:25:28.670 So scroll down a bit untilI see this right here.  <br>00:25:31.520 It's kinda giving you a formatfor what it should look like.  <br>00:25:33.980 And I'm gonna copy this config fromthe documentation. Thank you Waza.  <br>00:25:37.940 Check it out here. Command is firewall,drop location, the server. It's uh,  <br>00:25:42.355 the rule is executing on and then it'sgonna look at a rule or it's looking for  <br>00:25:45.355 a rule. This rule is whattriggers this firewall drop.  <br>00:25:48.140 Now when we tried to brute force whatrule was triggered? Let's go find out.  <br>00:25:51.620 I'm gonna jump to uh, ouragents. Go back to my circ Circs,  <br>00:25:54.980 go to security Events. Events andlet's see, it was just earlier, right?  <br>00:25:58.675 Like at 33. Yeah. So here's the alert.You can see yes, it was Bernard Hack.  <br>00:26:02.780 Well and there's the alert IDright there. The rule ID 57 10.  <br>00:26:07.130 That's what we want it to alert off of.  <br>00:26:08.780 So let's go back to our configurationthing here and we'll change that rule from  <br>00:26:12.590 57 63 to 57 10 and this willtime it out or add the firewall  <br>00:26:17.360 rule. And the time outhere is 180 seconds.  <br>00:26:19.610 It'll block the attacker for 180seconds. Pretty cool. So let's save that.  <br>00:26:23.540 Click on save, restart our manager. Justgive that a little, little bit of time.  <br>00:26:27.380 Here're starting, please wait,coffee break. Okay, it's restarted.  <br>00:26:31.790 Now what we wanna do nowis go back to our agent,  <br>00:26:33.710 go back to Search network Chuck andwe'll go to security events and go to  <br>00:26:37.760 events. So last thing we saw agentstarted and stopped. Refresh that. Okay,  <br>00:26:41.570 we're here now let's go and tryto brute force it one more time.  <br>00:26:44.100 Actually real quickly, see if we canlog in. So this time I'm gonna use Root.  <br>00:26:46.980 I know a real user on that system.Let's see if it lets me. Okay, so we're,  <br>00:26:50.460 it's allowing us right now. Nowwe don't have to brute force.  <br>00:26:53.070 We can just try to login with Bernard Hack.  <br>00:26:54.630 Well what that should do is trigger.Now it's right now it's 1203.  <br>00:26:57.870 It should trigger that new activerule. Let's go see. Bam. There it is.  <br>00:27:02.190 So 1203 attempt. Attempt to log inwith non-existent user. Bernard Hack.  <br>00:27:06.120 Well immediately the firewall at dropactive response blocks me. So now,  <br>00:27:10.890 right now for 180 secondsanyway, if I even try to log in,  <br>00:27:14.105 even with a real user, Iget nothing. I'm blocked.  <br>00:27:18.570 I can't even ping it., it's kinda crazy.  <br>00:27:21.210 Let's do a continuous ping and see whenit lets me out outta jail here. Oh,  <br>00:27:25.500 we're back. We're back. Okay, so howcool is that? And just so you know,  <br>00:27:28.710 you can do those active responses basedon a variety of rules. It's so custom.  <br>00:27:33.095 That's why this is so powerful.  <br>00:27:34.350 You can even do it off of like a certaincommand was run or a certain log came  <br>00:27:38.670 about in, in the system you can run aa, an active response. It's so crazy.  <br>00:27:43.740 Now two more things I wanna show youreal quick. First is vulnerabilities. Um,  <br>00:27:47.280 right now if I go to my search network,Chuck and I go to Vulnerabilities.  <br>00:27:51.300 Nothing there. Why? Becauseit's not enabled by default.  <br>00:27:54.270 The system does not search for that. Soit's really, really easy to set this up.  <br>00:27:57.750 We'll go to waza management configuration.  <br>00:27:59.940 Just like before we'llgo to edit configuration.  <br>00:28:02.070 And here we're gonna search forvulnerability detector. Right there.  <br>00:28:06.605 It tells us enabled. No,let's change that to yes,  <br>00:28:10.680 we definitely want that. Then we clickon save and restart Manager, confirm now.  <br>00:28:15.000 So once this restarts, noticethe options it has here.  <br>00:28:17.880 It'll run a full scan every six hours.  <br>00:28:19.680 It'll also run on Start when the servicestarts up. So once this finishes,  <br>00:28:24.090 we'll restart our service and Windowsand Linux and see what happens. Okay,  <br>00:28:27.815 cool. It's done there.I'm gonna go to Windows,  <br>00:28:30.030 restart my service here andwe're restart my service here.  <br>00:28:32.550 I restarting was at Agents.Cool. So now at this point,  <br>00:28:35.880 and if we check our agents, I'lljust go to my Windows machine here,  <br>00:28:38.340 go to vulnerabilities. Cool. Soscan's complete, didn't find anything.  <br>00:28:42.210 Now the reason for that is that my Windowsmachine has like no apps installed on  <br>00:28:45.660 it,  <br>00:28:45.750 but just know to enable the vulnerabilityscanning you have to enable it on the  <br>00:28:49.470 system, on the Waza server. But theagents have that configured by default.  <br>00:28:53.250 Now if I go back to my other server thathas all kinds of fun stuff configured,  <br>00:28:57.300 I gotta get logged back in here.Chloe, she has a bad version of vlc,  <br>00:29:00.990 media player, high severity cde.Wow, look at that, dude, this is fun.  <br>00:29:05.520 Gives you all the details ofit. Oh my gosh, it's so cool.  <br>00:29:08.280 But I wouldn't have known that if Ididn't have this on her system and it just  <br>00:29:11.340 tells me automatically.  <br>00:29:12.780 Now speaking of telling you automaticallyyou'll need some sort of alert, right?  <br>00:29:16.740 Waza has that. They've gotemail alerts and Slack alerts.  <br>00:29:19.380 I'm gonna show you Slack realquick. How to set that up.  <br>00:29:21.570 The first one I'll do is open on Slackand create a new channel just for waza  <br>00:29:25.170 Waza alerts.  <br>00:29:27.870 Now I'll go out to Slackand create a new app.  <br>00:29:30.990 Now this will not be a tutorialon how Slack apps work.  <br>00:29:33.870 I'll just walk you through the basicsyou need to know about right now.  <br>00:29:35.970 And this goes without sayingyou do need a Slack account.  <br>00:29:39.270 So I'll click on create new appfrom name it was uh, alerts,  <br>00:29:44.080 select my workspace, create the app.  <br>00:29:46.210 And then all I wanna add really isan incoming webhook. Activate it.  <br>00:29:49.300 And then at the bottom I'll clickon add new webhook to workspace.  <br>00:29:52.720 I'll click on new channel WazaAlerts Allow. And that's it.  <br>00:29:56.920 And all I need from this is thiswebhook url. I'll copy that,  <br>00:30:00.250 get back to my Wza dashboard.  <br>00:30:02.440 And I'm gonna go back tothat configuration pagewhere we were at before where  <br>00:30:04.660 we spent a lot of time. Clickon Wza, go to management,  <br>00:30:07.395 and then go to configuration. Same thingas before. Click on edit configuration.  <br>00:30:10.900 And here I'm gonna search forintegrations or just integration.  <br>00:30:15.340 And it looks like I don't have asection for that. I'll just add it here.  <br>00:30:18.130 So I'll just go to the top and just underglobal and I'll paste this config from  <br>00:30:22.330 the documentation.  <br>00:30:23.440 The only thing I'll change hereis pasting my webhook right there,  <br>00:30:26.230 which I need to copyagain, paste it there.  <br>00:30:28.360 And actually there is one more thing Iwanna change just in case you don't wanna  <br>00:30:30.975 be killed with alerts because this default setting will have a bunch of  <br>00:30:35.470 alerts sent to me basedon like all the events.  <br>00:30:37.840 And of course you can change the severitylevel of events that are sent to you  <br>00:30:41.260 or even just specify a specific ruleID you're looking for. So for example,  <br>00:30:46.000 right underneath here I can addrule id. And what do you say we do?  <br>00:30:50.110 57 10. That same rule as earlier that weare doing the action roll off of. Cool.  <br>00:30:54.850 So we have our web hook in place,  <br>00:30:56.260 the url we have our rule to alert offof Save it, save and restart manager.  <br>00:31:00.610 Once that is restarted, we'll doour little test here in a moment.  <br>00:31:03.070 And real quick, look, there'snothing in the uh, waza alerts yet.  <br>00:31:06.250 It's kind of quiet here.Cool, it's restarted.  <br>00:31:08.320 Now let's try and log in withBernard Hack. Well again,  <br>00:31:13.900 that should block us. Andthen over here, BAM was alert.  <br>00:31:18.105 Actually hit my watch too. Was I alert?Look at that invalid user. Bernard Hack.  <br>00:31:22.690 Well, from this IP address, which I'mgonna have Nick or Austin block right now,  <br>00:31:27.610 that's awesome, right? So, okay, this isprobably a long video, I realize that.  <br>00:31:32.020 But waza is a powerful tool that willnot only help you protect your family,  <br>00:31:36.220 your own lab, your business, butit'll teach you a ton about security,  <br>00:31:39.940 about hacking about Blue team and thefact that it's free and open source that I  <br>00:31:43.450 just did all of this, it costs menothing except for the hosting,  <br>00:31:46.900 which you could do it on-prem,it's gonna be free for you.  <br>00:31:48.880 It's just kind of crazy.  <br>00:31:49.750 So I hope you have as much fun with thistool as I have and we'll continue to  <br>00:31:53.020 have fun with.

(Docker Containers STREAMING Kali Linux to your browser)  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/U7e-mcJdZok](https://www.youtube.com/watch/U7e-mcJdZok)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.030 What I'm about to show you is theultimate hacking workspace. No joke.  <br>00:00:03.910 This technology is nuts. Andhonestly, I use this thing every day.  <br>00:00:08.200 Change the game for me,completely like check this out.  <br>00:00:10.520 I may be researching hacking stuff, andthere's some sketchy links out there.  <br>00:00:13.080 But with one click,  <br>00:00:18.750 just like that, a new browseropen, but it's isolated, secure.  <br>00:00:22.390 Heck it's not even on my [machine.Is](http://machine.is/) it a bad link? I don't care.  <br>00:00:25.890 Not my machine or maybe I want a fresh,  <br>00:00:27.550 clean and sense of call Lennoxfor some quick hacking or testing.  <br>00:00:30.340 Boom right here in my browser seconds.And when I'm done, boom, blow it up.  <br>00:00:34.350 Like it never existed.  <br>00:00:35.330 Or maybe a spin up two and have 'em attackeach other Cali and Navy U boom too.  <br>00:00:39.210 And no, this doesn't involve some heavyvirtual machines or WSL two it's Docker  <br>00:00:43.540 containers streaming to yourbrowser. What, in the best part,  <br>00:00:47.480 I'm gonna show you how to setthis up in about five minutes.  <br>00:00:50.120 Me and Cameron are hi. That's mybrother. It could be in the cloud.  <br>00:00:52.700 It could be in your house. And myfavorite part, it's completely free.  <br>00:00:55.900 Thanks to our sponsor. Chasm [workspaces.So](http://workspaces.so/) get you coffee ready or tea.  <br>00:00:59.900 If you're a loser, shut up. Let's do this.  <br>00:01:04.110 So end up talking.  <br>00:01:05.050 Let's talk about what you needto actually get this thing going.  <br>00:01:07.110 The list is not long. That's the goodnews. Cameron tell 'em what we need. Oh,  <br>00:01:12.130 I was not ready for this. nowall you pretty much need is a server,  <br>00:01:15.650 which might sound scary, but it'sjust a small server. That's it?  <br>00:01:18.170 Cameron tell 'em what we need. Go ahead.  <br>00:01:24.560 I know you're staring at me. So hereare the minimum survey requirements.  <br>00:01:27.330 We're gonna be two VCPS, four gigsof Ram and 50 gigabytes of storage,  <br>00:01:32.700 SSD preferred. And this applies to cloudor OnPrem, which could be your house.  <br>00:01:36.540 But we're gonna show you both. Thanks,Cameron. got my chair. See how,  <br>00:01:40.640 what Cameron set. That's prettymuch it. Well, one more thing.  <br>00:01:43.330 You gotta have coffee, everything init requires coffee or tea. Shut up.  <br>00:01:46.870 Never Chuck duck coffee.Now I know you're ready.  <br>00:01:48.790 I know you're itching to get starteddoing this, but first, before we do that,  <br>00:01:51.910 I wanna talk about the magic behindhow this actually works. Now,  <br>00:01:54.710 if you don't care about that,go ahead and skip forward.  <br>00:01:56.230 I got time stamps below,but chasm is so cool. I, I,  <br>00:02:00.230 I think I just wanna tellyou about it. Actually.  <br>00:02:01.590 I don't wanna tell you about it. Cameron'sgonna tell you about how chasm works,  <br>00:02:04.800 how the magic of Docker containerstreaming to your browser  <br>00:02:09.630 works. I said works a lot.Anyways. Cameron saved me.  <br>00:02:13.380 here's how chasm works. Soyou install chasm on your server. Now,  <br>00:02:16.340 if you wanna open up a secure web browser,  <br>00:02:17.760 or even an instance of call Linux chasmwill automatically open this up in a  <br>00:02:21.260 Docker container and streamit to your browser. He works.  <br>00:02:23.700 Isn't that cool camerabe more excited anyways.  <br>00:02:27.070 And it does this using chasmsproprietary software called chasm B,  <br>00:02:30.900 which is it's it's open [source.It](http://source.it/)'s open source. There we go.  <br>00:02:36.010 oh yeah. One thing.Camera move. Gimme your pen.  <br>00:02:38.850 So these Docker containersare just regular containers.  <br>00:02:41.440 They're actually on Docker hub andyou can just pull them from there.  <br>00:02:44.920 You can go look at 'em and you can evencreate your own custom Docker images,  <br>00:02:48.560 container things.Anyways, here you go. Oh,  <br>00:02:50.880 also also think about the start camera.One way is you can put it in the cloud.  <br>00:02:53.320 We're gonna show you how to do that.This is my cloud. Shut up camera.  <br>00:02:55.900 And whenever you're surfing the internetor doing some hacking stuff in Cali,  <br>00:02:59.540 um, you're using theclouds IP address. So,  <br>00:03:02.760 whereas normally you'd be going directlyto your ISP using your home internet IP  <br>00:03:06.840 address using chasm. You'rekind of hiding yourself a bit,  <br>00:03:10.250 especially from your ISP, keepingyourself a bit anonymous and you,  <br>00:03:13.540 you could be anywhere you could be atStarbucks drinking, coffee or tea .  <br>00:03:17.820 So,  <br>00:03:18.040 because you're chasm server is installedon your business network or your home  <br>00:03:21.510 network, you have access to everythingthat is on your network. Like,  <br>00:03:24.910 think about that cameranot being excited enough.  <br>00:03:26.530 You have access to your Sonology insideyour home network or all that stuff.  <br>00:03:29.430 Like just all your stuff, your,  <br>00:03:30.790 all your other home lab stuff remotelythrough dock container streaming,  <br>00:03:34.070 just magic, magic, magic. Butthat's the basic of how chasm works.  <br>00:03:37.170 But now you wanna set it up, but I'llhave Chuck walk you through that. Yeah,  <br>00:03:41.020 yeah. Hear you tea drinking. Wooy allright. nothing wrong with tea,  <br>00:03:45.400 but you know, coffee's better. Okay.  <br>00:03:47.300 Now time to actually installchasm on our server, uh,  <br>00:03:50.260 like Cameron was talking about, he justtook freaking forever to explain it.  <br>00:03:53.120 I'm just kidding. He did a greatjob. Let us know how he did guys.  <br>00:03:55.400 If you wanna see more of Cameron, ifyou don't, we're gonna show him anyway.  <br>00:03:58.400 Now we mentioned that we can installall this pretty much anywhere,  <br>00:04:01.030 but the two I'm gonna show youis the cloud. And then, uh,  <br>00:04:03.950 OnPrim AKA your houseor your business. Now,  <br>00:04:06.490 thankfully the differencebetween the two is not a lot.  <br>00:04:08.810 It's pretty much the same, but let'sfocus on the cloud first. Now, you know,  <br>00:04:11.490 my favorite cloud provider,  <br>00:04:12.430 my favorite thing to do and use is Linodemainly because if you've never used  <br>00:04:16.610 'em before you get a hundred dollarsfree credit right now to sign up.  <br>00:04:19.510 So you much get to try this out for [free.So](http://free.so/) just shut up and do it link below.  <br>00:04:24.060 So with your Len node account setup,  <br>00:04:25.570 we'll first go to create at the topleft and, uh, well create, click on it,  <br>00:04:30.060 create a Len node from here.  <br>00:04:31.600 We're just gonna do our best to meetthe minimum requirements. First,  <br>00:04:34.060 the images we're gonna rock UbuntuUbuntu 20 0 4. Don't use 21.  <br>00:04:39.560 yeah, he's right. I tried 21did not work 20 0 4 El least. That's at,  <br>00:04:43.470 at the time of this recording,I'm losing my mind anyways,  <br>00:04:45.790 too much coffee already.  <br>00:04:46.470 How you doing T boy we'll then selectour regions somewhere close to you.  <br>00:04:49.150 And then for the plan, this is wherethe minimum requirements come in. Um,  <br>00:04:51.830 dedicated. I don't need that. Idon't have that kind of money.  <br>00:04:53.890 I'm doing shared CPU. And the minimumrequirement will be this guy right here.  <br>00:04:57.120 Leino for gigabits orbites. Sorry, not bits.  <br>00:04:59.630 Four gigs of delicious Ram over arehere. And then two virtual CPUs.  <br>00:05:03.080 And we got plenty of hard repspace. Cause the minimum is 50 gigs.  <br>00:05:05.840 So this satisfies ourminimum requirements.  <br>00:05:08.010 Then I'll label it my chasm password.  <br>00:05:12.120 And that's pretty much it I'llclick on create Lin node. No, yeah,  <br>00:05:14.940 20 bucks a month.  <br>00:05:15.760 That's not the $5 a month we'renormally doing with these projects.  <br>00:05:18.360 That's because chasm is extra cooland require some extra, extra stuff.  <br>00:05:22.470 Now also keep in mind, I'm showingyou Le node. You can do this in AWS,  <br>00:05:25.890 digital ocean,  <br>00:05:26.610 pretty much any cloud provider thatcan produce virtual machines for you,  <br>00:05:29.490 which is all of [them.It](http://them.it/)'ll work now for on-prem.  <br>00:05:32.320 This will vary based onwhat you're using for me.  <br>00:05:34.450 I got prox Mo and all I'll do is createa VM. Make sure I'm doing UBO 2 20 0 4.  <br>00:05:38.170 Make sure my hard driveis at least 50 gigs.  <br>00:05:39.690 I go and throw like maybe75 at it for no reason,  <br>00:05:42.780 two virtual CPUs and four gigsRam. Again, this may vary for you,  <br>00:05:46.700 but that's pretty much the gist. Okay.Back to the node. Once yours is running,  <br>00:05:49.830 it's done provisioning.  <br>00:05:50.770 Let's go ahead and grab thisIP address and get logged in.  <br>00:05:53.080 Or you can copy the one over here.  <br>00:05:54.230 Copy launch your favorite terminalprogram on the windows. So I've got CMD,  <br>00:05:58.210 it'll be terminal on Mac and [Lennox.It](http://lennox.it/)'ll be SSH route at your IP address,  <br>00:06:01.900 hit enter fingerprints. Yep. And thenenter your password that you set earlier.  <br>00:06:05.370 We're in now the installation of chasmis actually the easiest part of this  <br>00:06:08.320 entire tutorial. So easy that I feelcomfortable letting Cameron do it. So, uh,  <br>00:06:12.020 go ahead, cam. All right.  <br>00:06:12.840 So the first thing we're gonna do hereis actually for stability and we're going  <br>00:06:16.100 to get a swap partition.  <br>00:06:17.590 We're gonna put in this first commandto actually create the swap partition.  <br>00:06:20.960 We're gonna upgrade the permissions,actually make it into swap.  <br>00:06:24.370 And then we're gonna turnon the swap partition.  <br>00:06:26.360 These four commands are gonnabe below in the description.  <br>00:06:28.810 You could actually just copy and pastethese in and make the swap partition.  <br>00:06:31.410 And just to make sure that wemade our swap successfully,  <br>00:06:34.130 we can use the cat command to look insideof the swap file. And I can see here,  <br>00:06:38.520 we have our swap partition now to makesure that our swap will come back.  <br>00:06:42.460 Whenever there is a reboot, let'sgo ahead and just run this command.  <br>00:06:44.800 And this will add this to the Fs tab file.  <br>00:06:47.160 Now that we have theswap partition set up,  <br>00:06:49.400 we can now download the installationfile using the w get command.  <br>00:06:53.680 And you can see we're actually gettingthis from S3, go ahead and enter and,  <br>00:06:57.550 and let's get that downloaded.  <br>00:06:58.950 And now let's just run an LS realquick just to make sure that the file  <br>00:07:01.930 downloaded correctly. So thisfile is in the dot GZ format.  <br>00:07:05.590 So we will need to unzip this inorder to get the installation file.  <br>00:07:08.950 So let's paste that command in thereand that will extract it to our current  <br>00:07:12.210 directory. And we can now see thechasm release folders right there.  <br>00:07:16.480 Then we will do pseudo bash and thatwill just run this installation script.  <br>00:07:20.510 Then they'll want us to accept the enduser license agreement, just hit yes.  <br>00:07:24.140 And enter. And this installation'sgonna take a little bit,  <br>00:07:26.500 so go take a coffee break. We'llget back to it in a second, man.  <br>00:07:29.640 Those are pretty fast install.Wasn't it? Yeah, I'm kidding.  <br>00:07:32.340 Now on our screen here, uh, theygive us some credentials. Uh,  <br>00:07:35.640 the only really important ones herefor us are gonna be the admin one.  <br>00:07:38.560 Let's go ahead and grab 'em all just incase and just paste these into a note.  <br>00:07:41.770 And once you have that past it away,  <br>00:07:42.840 let's get back to Le node andlet's copy our IP address,  <br>00:07:46.220 open up a new tab and let'sdo HTT PS call slash slash and  <br>00:07:50.990 let's paste in the IP address ofour ode hit advanced and proceed.  <br>00:07:55.010 And now let's paste in this credentialsthat we saved a second ago, right?  <br>00:07:57.790 When you log in, you'll be presentedwith the chasm console. Uh,  <br>00:08:00.700 the first place they log youinto here is the admin portion.  <br>00:08:03.920 So you'll notice a lot ofsettings and stuff here.  <br>00:08:06.270 We're not gonna get to that right now.We'll go into that later in the video,  <br>00:08:08.970 what we're mainly focused on here,  <br>00:08:10.410 it's just the workspaces portion andthat's where all the fun stuff is.  <br>00:08:13.280 Now we can move over to workspaces andwe're just gonna pick Chrome for this,  <br>00:08:16.290 that launch session andboom, just like that.  <br>00:08:19.570 We have a containerized browser streamingto our computer. All right, Cameron,  <br>00:08:23.110 get on my seat. Yep. That's thebig stuff. That's the basic stuff.  <br>00:08:27.010 and at this pointyou're pretty much done.  <br>00:08:29.130 Like you've got your chasm insulationgoing. You can access your stuff.  <br>00:08:32.330 And if you go back to the actually toget back to let me show you how to do  <br>00:08:34.770 that. When you're sitting herechilling in your instance, here,  <br>00:08:37.419 there are little dots on the left. Look,those dots, you can do a few things.  <br>00:08:40.940 One of the main things we care aboutright now is getting it back to our  <br>00:08:43.000 workspace. Click those four littledots, more, a lot of dots here,  <br>00:08:46.520 and you can launch other stuff.  <br>00:08:47.580 So they've got dedicated apps that againwill just launch a Docker container.  <br>00:08:51.080 But these are apps you can launchright now from G, which is, uh,  <br>00:08:54.760 like drawing stuff like Photoshopoffice, just a terminal.  <br>00:08:57.580 If you want a terminal Ubuntuand even visual studio code,  <br>00:09:00.320 which I'll just launch that realquick is pretty cool. And bam,  <br>00:09:02.400 just like that visual studio codestreaming to me from a Docker container,  <br>00:09:05.720 which still is just, isn't that crazy.  <br>00:09:08.040 a Docker container streamingand shoot even a to browsers,  <br>00:09:11.160 browsing in a browser on a virtualmachine, in the cloud using tour.  <br>00:09:16.370 And it's inside a Docker container.  <br>00:09:17.630 There's so many things happeningwith tech-wise. It's like,  <br>00:09:20.130 it hurts your brain to thinkabout it, how you're doing this.  <br>00:09:22.520 Can't get more secure thanthis or anonymous. Now, again,  <br>00:09:25.750 you're pretty much done. Like you couldleave the video and be happy about this,  <br>00:09:28.810 but you know, we can't end there.There's some more cool things you can do.  <br>00:09:31.310 Like, I don't know if you notice, butwhen we are back in our portal here,  <br>00:09:35.020 click over back on admin dude.  <br>00:09:37.260 this is more than just like atoy we can play with. This is a full,  <br>00:09:41.030 crazy enterprise system tool, which again,  <br>00:09:44.180 it takes 10 years to tell you all thethings it can do and walk through that.  <br>00:09:47.560 But I will show you just a few things.  <br>00:09:49.140 I think you'll love and you'll wannado right now. Camera say right now,  <br>00:09:52.590 right now, now the firstthing you may want.  <br>00:09:54.460 And it's the first thing I wantwas the ability to take like,  <br>00:09:57.010 like remember the intro we had likemaybe nefarious links like this one,  <br>00:10:00.830 you may not wanna open that inyour browser, on your main desktop.  <br>00:10:03.300 There could be all kinds of crazystuff that affect your computer.  <br>00:10:06.430 So we want to be able to right,click that and say open and chasm,  <br>00:10:09.770 open a Docker container. That's safe,secure, and isolated. That won't hurt me.  <br>00:10:13.110 How do we do that? Now? Thisis simply a Chrome extension.  <br>00:10:15.650 And if you name brave or Firefox,I believe they have Firefox.  <br>00:10:18.790 I'll check on brave, but I'msure they have all of it.  <br>00:10:20.560 We're simply gonna add an extension orinstalling extension on our browser.  <br>00:10:23.540 So I'm just gonna look forChrome extension store.  <br>00:10:27.160 I think that's what it's called.Yeah. Just Google that jump in there.  <br>00:10:29.540 And we'll search for chasm at the topleft. There we go. I love the tagline.  <br>00:10:33.160 Open an isolation. In fact, Camerontold me about that. It's pretty cool.  <br>00:10:35.670 Anyways, we're gonnaclick on, add to Chrome,  <br>00:10:37.520 click on ad extension and it'sadded, but not quite done yet.  <br>00:10:41.430 We have a few more thingswe have to configure here.  <br>00:10:43.070 We're gonna go up toour puzzle piece here,  <br>00:10:44.190 which stands for extensions in Chrome.  <br>00:10:45.640 We're gonna scroll down until we seechasm, which is weirdly great out.  <br>00:10:48.550 It makes me feel weird, but it's fine.  <br>00:10:49.750 We're gonna click on the threedots and click on options.  <br>00:10:54.080 We're gonna change just really onething here. We're gonna add the URL for,  <br>00:10:57.080 for our chasm server that we just setup or the one that you just set up.  <br>00:11:00.400 So a past mine in here just likethat. And you can even choose, like,  <br>00:11:03.820 if you wanted to open a new windowor a new tab, I like new tab.  <br>00:11:06.300 It feels more like it'spart of my browser.  <br>00:11:07.530 Like I'm not doing anything outsidemy system, even though I totally am.  <br>00:11:10.260 So anyways, enough of that clickon save and that part's done.  <br>00:11:12.540 Just one more thing we have to do.  <br>00:11:13.870 We're gonna get back to our chasmworkspace here, our chasm dashboard.  <br>00:11:16.880 And from here, we're gonnago to the top, right?  <br>00:11:18.700 Click a little icon thereand then click on profile.  <br>00:11:21.070 Cuz this will be a settingthat is set per user. And yeah,  <br>00:11:23.910 you probably guess you canhave multiple users with this.  <br>00:11:26.270 You can have your friends, yourfamily, your kids use this,  <br>00:11:28.850 have different profiles. We'lltalk about that. Anyways.  <br>00:11:31.790 One thing we're gonna change right here.We have the default workspace image.  <br>00:11:34.920 This is what we'll launch. Wheneveryou do that, right. Click thing.  <br>00:11:37.290 We showed you earlier, clickon the dropdown and then choose your image.  <br>00:11:40.980 I'm gonna choose. Let's do brave. I likebrave. That's it. It's already saved.  <br>00:11:44.680 I don't have to do anythingelse. And now we can test it.  <br>00:11:46.480 It's gonna go back to that Redditpage and I'll pick a random link here.  <br>00:11:49.160 This guy right here, right click.And here we are open link and chasm.  <br>00:11:53.160 And just like that,  <br>00:11:54.080 a Docker container is being spun upbehind the scenes and it's streaming to my  <br>00:11:58.400 browser. I'm not opening this URL onmy computer. It's not tracking me.  <br>00:12:01.760 It doesn't know my IP [address.It](http://address.it/)'s not looking at my cookies,  <br>00:12:04.080 looking at my history. I'm completelyanonymous. As far as tracking me goes.  <br>00:12:08.780 And the cool thing is whatever I dohere in this browser, it doesn't matter.  <br>00:12:11.880 I can do whatever I stinking. What?Because guess what? I can just delete it.  <br>00:12:15.030 Like watch this click on theselittle dots here, delete session.  <br>00:12:18.310 I can trash the sucker, bad website,malware, whatever don't care. I'm secure.  <br>00:12:23.270 So I deleted it. It's gone. I was neverthere. I never accessed that website.  <br>00:12:26.810 No proof. And I think, youknow, think about that.  <br>00:12:28.550 That's probably the future of howwe deal with weird stuff like this,  <br>00:12:31.730 how we browse the internetright now, your computer,  <br>00:12:34.160 it designed to track a lotof what you do, cookies, um,  <br>00:12:37.450 your IP address your history. Andif your computer could track it,  <br>00:12:39.980 that means all these other websites,your accessing can track it as well.  <br>00:12:42.440 Not to mention these scare ofviruses in malware, which yeah,  <br>00:12:45.300 and we've got tools that can prevent that.  <br>00:12:46.460 We got tools that canscan what we download, uh,  <br>00:12:48.980 prevent what we access on the internet.But you know what? They're not perfect.  <br>00:12:51.960 The ideal use cases that we open upeverything in an isolated sandbox.  <br>00:12:55.350 And if we do do something bad, it doesn'tmatter. That instance, that browser,  <br>00:12:59.280 that VM is transient. Ephemeralbig words. It just disappears.  <br>00:13:03.590 Cuz it doesn't matter. Now secondtweak. I wanna show you real quick.  <br>00:13:05.850 Check this out. It's actuallykind of two tweaks in one first.  <br>00:13:08.390 If you scroll through your appshere in your, your workspaces,  <br>00:13:10.650 you'll notice that you don'tsee Cali Linux, which we,  <br>00:13:13.070 we talked about that a lot, but it'snot here. Did we lie to you? No, no.  <br>00:13:16.380 You can add more images and someare already default installed.  <br>00:13:19.340 So if I go back to admin, my adminportal over here on the left,  <br>00:13:22.520 I can click on images where I can managethe Docker images or containers that I  <br>00:13:26.600 can launch. Go and click on that.  <br>00:13:27.940 And here we already have 26 imagesready to go, but not all are enabled.  <br>00:13:31.960 So I'll start clicking onthe arrows down here. Here.  <br>00:13:33.880 We have doom for some reason.  <br>00:13:34.890 So if you wanna play doom in yourbrowser from a Docker container street,  <br>00:13:37.510 actually that sounds prettycool. Anyways, let's continue.  <br>00:13:40.270 I wanna go find call there. Itis call Lennox to enable this.  <br>00:13:43.830 I wanna click that box for the can.  <br>00:13:45.080 We're gonna click on the little dotshere on the right click on edit.  <br>00:13:48.490 And then right here towards themiddle, we have the enabled check box.  <br>00:13:51.440 Check that now while we'rehere at the same time,  <br>00:13:53.450 I'm gonna go ahead anddo the second tweak.  <br>00:13:55.560 Now when we launch Kelly Linuxwithout changing this second thing,  <br>00:13:59.290 it's gonna log us in as aregular user without root access.  <br>00:14:03.360 But of course we want root access. Wewant ultimate godlike control, right?  <br>00:14:06.440 One thing we have to changehere to make that happen.  <br>00:14:08.680 If you scroll down just a little bithere, we have the Docker run config,  <br>00:14:12.310 which by the way, you cando a ton of stuff with like,  <br>00:14:14.580 this is like a regular container.And if you know Docker containers,  <br>00:14:17.590 you can do everything here prettymuch. But one thing we care about,  <br>00:14:20.530 we're gonna do some JSON real quick.Don't worry. It's not scary. Uh,  <br>00:14:23.450 just follow along with me first. We'regonna type in user between double quotes.  <br>00:14:26.610 I'll do double quotethe user double quote,  <br>00:14:29.480 then I'll do a colon and then I'll doanother double quote and say root and then  <br>00:14:34.050 double quote. So just like this, thatis be beautiful. JSON right there.  <br>00:14:37.220 That's all we need. Just go down tothe bottom. Click on, submit done.  <br>00:14:40.940 Now it's not quite readyyet. If we go to our, uh,  <br>00:14:43.760 workspaces here at the top left,you'll see it here. Where to go.  <br>00:14:46.940 Oh right there. But it's got like alittle warning message right now. Your uh,  <br>00:14:51.210 chasm server is downloading the Dockercontainer for Cali getting all that  <br>00:14:54.680 stuff. Ready? No give, give ita minute. Just coffee break.  <br>00:14:57.820 You tip my coffee [again.So](http://again.so/) now Cali is ready.  <br>00:14:59.820 I'm gonna go and launch the sucker realquick launch, which this is so cool.  <br>00:15:03.040 Right? And now that we have root enabled,all we have to do is when it launches,  <br>00:15:06.240 when we're in our terminal, like weshould be like you are right now.  <br>00:15:08.800 We'll do SU or switch userspit to become root. Okay.  <br>00:15:12.590 Now for the third tweak and it's thelast one I'm gonna show you cuz we don't  <br>00:15:15.030 have enough time andthis one's pretty cool.  <br>00:15:16.510 It involves users and web filtering sofar we've been using the admin profile,  <br>00:15:20.510 but of course you can add other users.  <br>00:15:22.210 So what I'm gonna do is add my daughtersas users, my two oldest anyway,  <br>00:15:25.470 Chloe and Addie.  <br>00:15:26.150 And what I'll demonstrate is how I canmake sure that they're gonna be browsing  <br>00:15:28.730 safely and securely and then law.They can access with web filtering,  <br>00:15:32.990 which is just built in,  <br>00:15:34.180 I can whitelist and blacklist withwhat I want them to access. So anyways,  <br>00:15:37.220 let's check it out real quick,super easy. So just like before,  <br>00:15:39.500 I'll go to my admin portalhere and over here on the left,  <br>00:15:41.940 I'll click on users right now.I've got the default users.  <br>00:15:44.140 I'll go ahead and click on adduser to add a new one, Chloe,  <br>00:15:47.560 and then I'll set a password forher. And now just keep in mind.  <br>00:15:49.880 I'm manually setting apassword for or Chloe,  <br>00:15:51.950 but you can integrate this with an L Dand SAML or single signon situation at  <br>00:15:55.930 your business. If you have one or ifyou have a home lab with that stuff,  <br>00:15:59.070 you can do it too, cuz I totallydo. And I will end up doing that.  <br>00:16:01.510 But username and password is pretty muchall we need for now. I'll click OnIt.  <br>00:16:05.080 I'll add my second user for add submit.  <br>00:16:07.710 So now all I have to do is give themmy IP address or the URL of my chasm  <br>00:16:10.970 instance and they can get accessto this with our credentials. Now,  <br>00:16:13.440 moving beyond that, Ican assign web filtering,  <br>00:16:15.550 very simple to set this up almoststupid, easy, uh, over here on the left,  <br>00:16:19.170 we'll see an option four webfilter. Go ahead and select that.  <br>00:16:22.340 And here we got nothing.Let's create something.  <br>00:16:24.300 Go ahead and click on ad policy. Nowwe don't have a ton of options here.  <br>00:16:27.920 I name this test, but some cool things,  <br>00:16:29.560 especially for kids or peoplethat you want to restrict too.  <br>00:16:32.890 We can say deny by default. So likewhatever website it is, don't go to it.  <br>00:16:36.270 Unless I explicitly say they're allowedto go to, which is perfect for my kids.  <br>00:16:39.310 They're curious.  <br>00:16:40.090 So I can say deny by default and theonly site that can access is network  <br>00:16:43.800 [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/) also network chuck.coffee.You just put that all on the black list.  <br>00:16:48.510 Thanks Cameron. He justsays on the black list,  <br>00:16:50.200 we're gonna put that in the whitelist. and just scroll down.  <br>00:16:53.340 We got a few more options or reallyjust one more enable safe search,  <br>00:16:56.300 which is a Google option to makesure they don't search for bad stuff.  <br>00:16:59.520 And then we could enable categorization.  <br>00:17:01.200 But that is a featurethat must be licensed,  <br>00:17:03.300 which you're probably thinkingChuck, you said it was free. It is,  <br>00:17:06.319 but not everything's free.This is a community edition,  <br>00:17:08.260 which is more than enough. Likeyou're gonna have a hard time,  <br>00:17:10.859 like not finding all the features youwant. We get a snapshot, the differences.  <br>00:17:14.150 And one thing I wanna pointout, and this is just crazy.  <br>00:17:16.050 Community edition is $0 and includes allfeatures of enterprise right.  <br>00:17:20.730 Then one of the main limits is thatyou are limited to five simultaneous  <br>00:17:23.690 sessions and excludes somebranding and web categorization,  <br>00:17:26.650 which is what I just hit. Actually,  <br>00:17:28.550 we can't take advantage of some crazyURL filtering your web categorization,  <br>00:17:32.110 but we get some pretty coolstuff anyway. And of course,  <br>00:17:34.080 if you wanna goprofessional or enterprise,  <br>00:17:35.900 and if you're a businessschool or government entity,this is perfect for you.  <br>00:17:38.820 But anyways, let's continueanyways. That's all we care about.  <br>00:17:40.760 I'm gonna click on submit. Andthen one more thing we have to do.  <br>00:17:42.920 We have to apply this policyto our users to do that.  <br>00:17:45.240 We'll go over here tothe left, to our images.  <br>00:17:47.390 This will be applied per imageand I'll find, for example, brave,  <br>00:17:50.330 let's go and click on brave clickon the icons here, click on edit.  <br>00:17:53.340 And if I scroll down justa bit and when I say a bit,  <br>00:17:55.560 I mean a lot wehave the web filter policy.  <br>00:17:57.830 I'll change this from inheritto my, there it is right there.  <br>00:18:00.800 My test one and click on [submit.So](http://submit.so/) now let's give it a test.  <br>00:18:03.920 I wanna go ahead and launch brave.  <br>00:18:05.020 It should apply to me as well andright off the bat access tonight.  <br>00:18:08.570 So I try to go to Googleor Facebook, nothing,  <br>00:18:12.010 but I try to go to network chuck.com.What if I try to go to network [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/).  <br>00:18:15.930 Hey, real quick, Cameronand Chuck from the future,  <br>00:18:18.170 we figured out that it doesn'twant the HTTPS in there at all.  <br>00:18:20.850 So go ahead and take that out and justhave the domain name in there soon.  <br>00:18:24.270 Now let's go back to our workspaces.Find our brave web browser,  <br>00:18:27.450 go and launch the sucker. It shouldwork for me. You should block me.  <br>00:18:30.140 I am all users and by default it shouldblock the first website it comes with.  <br>00:18:33.260 Yeah, access denied. But now if we goto network, chuck.coffee, for example,  <br>00:18:38.980 naked by coffee. No [problem.My](http://problem.my/) daughters can too. Now it was cool.  <br>00:18:42.540 And check this out. If I go back to mydashboard and I go to my admin portal,  <br>00:18:45.320 if I scroll it like notice real quick,  <br>00:18:47.240 we have insight into everything goingon with thought our chasm instance here,  <br>00:18:51.010 or our chasm server, all theimage usage, all the errors.  <br>00:18:53.990 And then down here atthe bottom domain usage,  <br>00:18:56.190 we can track what our people are going to.  <br>00:18:58.510 So think about thatfrom a user perspective,  <br>00:18:59.830 as you're trying to protect your company'susers, uh, or your kids or whatever,  <br>00:19:04.030 you get a crazy amount of insight andcontrol. Okay, I gotta stop there.  <br>00:19:08.050 there are a ton more featuresI could talk of about like casting,  <br>00:19:11.240 which you can share your session withother people and they can watch you do  <br>00:19:13.640 stuff, uh, staging, which is crazy. Makesthings go faster, just so much more.  <br>00:19:17.800 I can't go into it. And by the way,if you do want to go into that,  <br>00:19:20.400 if you wanna learn how to do this,we'll have a little minicourse below.  <br>00:19:23.200 Check it out.  <br>00:19:23.860 But now I wanna change gears for asecond because I've shown you some cool  <br>00:19:26.400 stuff.  <br>00:19:26.640 I've shown you two use cases like securebrowsing and having a really awesome  <br>00:19:30.200 line X distro, just bamexploded onto your browser.  <br>00:19:33.770 But how do companies use this? Howcould you use it as a, a daily grind?  <br>00:19:37.610 How can you apply it to what you do now?  <br>00:19:39.840 There are some pretty cool use casesabove and beyond what we've already showed  <br>00:19:43.590 you. So now I'm gonna kickit off to Cameron. Cameron,  <br>00:19:45.580 show the people some cool stuff I'mgonna see Beardie right.  <br>00:19:48.990 So now that we're done going over justpersonal use case for like browser  <br>00:19:51.970 isolation, or maybe standing upyour own call Linux or Rubi desktop,  <br>00:19:55.270 there are some more use cases forthis that are a little less personal,  <br>00:19:58.170 more like business or enterprise suchas replacing your VDI solution. Uh,  <br>00:20:03.060 maybe your company right now usesCitrix. Citrix can be really cumbersome,  <br>00:20:06.730 hard to set up licensing. It'shard. What's great about it.  <br>00:20:09.980 That it's web native.  <br>00:20:10.500 You don't have to have anything asstalled on your endpoints in order to use  <br>00:20:12.940 chasm, you can have it justrun through any web browser,  <br>00:20:15.480 because if you ever use Citrixor any of the other stuff,  <br>00:20:17.530 you have to install crapon people's computers.  <br>00:20:19.130 It sucks and worry aboutversioning on the desktops, blah,  <br>00:20:23.530 none of that and chasms images areall secure outta the box because they  <br>00:20:27.530 constantly update theirrolling images every night,  <br>00:20:29.530 because the old way to do stuff is stupid.  <br>00:20:32.700 You would have a golden image thatadmins would like go into log into and  <br>00:20:36.240 update, like apply updatesand apply the patches of crap.  <br>00:20:39.230 This is like it's auto magic, automagic, and last but not least,  <br>00:20:43.760 it could be used for DevOps pipelines.  <br>00:20:45.440 So whether you want to testyour own custom doc Docker, ah,  <br>00:20:48.270 docking Docker containers or your code,  <br>00:20:51.020 you can use their secure APIs that areprovided with chasm to test that. Thanks,  <br>00:20:54.560 Cameron. All right. So chasm seriously.  <br>00:20:57.420 I'm gonna probably usethis every single day.  <br>00:20:59.700 I'm legit gonna have mykids use it. Cameron,  <br>00:21:01.200 you're gonna use this thing always,always forever. And I I'm being serious.  <br>00:21:04.520 I do just constantly spinup news stuff, new VMs.  <br>00:21:07.930 And this is a way easier way to do this.  <br>00:21:09.670 If I just wanna test something realquick or if I wanna browse to kind of a  <br>00:21:12.990 weird URL and not worryabout getting hacked,  <br>00:21:15.850 not to mention all the crazy usecases that Cameron mentioned,  <br>00:21:18.900 it's a pretty cool thing.  <br>00:21:19.710 So thanks again to chasm workspaces forsponsoring this video and making such a  <br>00:21:23.390 freaking cool product and like, yeah,I know they did sponsor this video,  <br>00:21:26.650 but I only say yes to things I reallylike and enjoy and will actually use  <br>00:21:30.820 myself, especially when it's free andaccessible to pretty much everybody.  <br>00:21:34.160 So I dunno what you're waiting for.If you haven't already tried it,  <br>00:21:36.060 if you didn't followalong this video, do it.  <br>00:21:38.800 And it's right now right now is whenyou gotta do it.

Prepare a domain name (costing approximately $12 per year) via Google Domains.  <br>2. Ensure you have a computer or server in your home network (any OS is acceptable).  <br>3. Install CloudFlare Tunnel on that computer or server to create a secure connection to CloudFlare.  <br>4. Sign up for a CloudFlare account and validate your email.  <br>5. Add your new domain to CloudFlare and select the free plan.  <br>6. Change your domain's name servers to CloudFlare's name servers in your domain registrar settings.  <br>7. In the CloudFlare dashboard, navigate to the Zero Trust dashboard and click on "Tunnels."  <br>8. Create a new tunnel, naming it appropriately (e.g., "Elon Musk's House Tunnel").  <br>9. Choose your server flavor (e.g., Docker) and copy the provided installation code.  <br>10. Paste the installation code into your server's command line and run it (add "-d" for daemon mode).  <br>11. Return to the CloudFlare dashboard and configure the tunnel by adding the services you want to expose.  <br>12. For services with self-signed certificates, adjust the TLS settings to allow it.  <br>13. Test the tunnel to ensure everything works correctly from both inside and outside your home network.  <br>14. Add additional public hostnames as necessary for other services you want to expose.|# [tactiq.io](http://tactiq.io/) free youtube transcript  <br># EXPOSE your home network to the INTERNET!! (it's safe)  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/ey4u7OUAF3c](https://www.youtube.com/watch/ey4u7OUAF3c)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.090 In this video we're going to exposeyour home network to the internet.  <br>00:00:04.440 Now don't be scary.  <br>00:00:05.280 This is completely secure and kind ofcrazy actually cuz we're not punching  <br>00:00:09.520 holes through your firewall,  <br>00:00:10.520 which is what you might do with areverse proxy like engine X or traffic  <br>00:00:13.560 forwarding and exposing ports 80and 4 43. Now we're not doing that.  <br>00:00:17.760 Instead we're creating a tunnel.  <br>00:00:19.440 And with this tunnel we cansecurely expose anythingon your home network to the  <br>00:00:24.640 internet, a website, prox,walk Porter, anything.  <br>00:00:27.800 And I'm telling you this is nuts.  <br>00:00:29.320 Everything you expose will haveits own sub-domain and SSL cert.  <br>00:00:33.560 Even if you only have a ACTTP or a self-signed cert,  <br>00:00:36.560 we're setting up CloudFlare Tunnel afree service that allows you to connect  <br>00:00:40.360 securely to your home networkresources from anywhere.  <br>00:00:43.200 And it doesn't matter whatkind of home network you have,  <br>00:00:45.320 I know some of you your is P sucks andyou got CG nat and all that doesn't  <br>00:00:49.600 matter, this will work. Settingthis up is super simple.  <br>00:00:52.280 It'll only take a few sip ofcoffee. Here's what you need.  <br>00:00:55.710 Coffee being one of those things.First you will need a domain name.  <br>00:00:58.560 I'm gonna set up one realquick with Google [Domains.It](http://domains.it/)'s about 12 bucks a year.  <br>00:01:01.800 It's just the cost ofdoing business. Second,  <br>00:01:03.640 you'll need a computer or server insideyour home network and this can be  <br>00:01:07.640 running pretty much any OS and um,I think you might have one, right?  <br>00:01:10.640 And it's on this computer or server thatwill install CloudFlare Tunnel and then  <br>00:01:14.560 it will tunnel out to CloudFlare andit's through that tunnel that we can tell  <br>00:01:17.720 CloudFlare to route pretty much anysub-domain to anything inside our home  <br>00:01:21.960 network, SSL cert and all. And yeah,that's pretty much all you need.  <br>00:01:24.920 Let's get our coffee and getstarted. But before we get started,  <br>00:01:27.560 I wanna talk about this,  <br>00:01:28.740 the computer or server that you're usingin your home network. And like I said,  <br>00:01:32.400 anything will work.  <br>00:01:33.100 But I want you to try and start usingRed Hat Enterprise Linux or Rel Rel.  <br>00:01:37.560 Rel Rel Red Hat is the sponsor of thisvideo making this video happen And I've  <br>00:01:41.760 recently started using Red Hat Enterpriselinnux and My Home Network. But why?  <br>00:01:46.220 Two reasons. Number one,  <br>00:01:47.520 red Hat Enterprise linnux is the flavorof linnux at enterprise companies use.  <br>00:01:51.520 You know the big companiesthat you may want to work for,  <br>00:01:53.960 they use the stuff and for a lot ofreasons, reliable, secure, standardized.  <br>00:01:57.840 It's the gold standard if youwant to run Lennox professionally,  <br>00:02:00.640 enterprise Lee in your network.  <br>00:02:03.220 But it's also not free usually.  <br>00:02:05.870 I've got a little surprisefor you here in a bit.  <br>00:02:07.640 Now getting back to the point 0.1 thatit's used by enterprise companies.  <br>00:02:11.000 Why do you care?  <br>00:02:11.870 Well for me the point of having a homelab doing all the stuff in my crazy  <br>00:02:15.640 office is to get hands on experiencewith enterprise IT stuff so I can learn  <br>00:02:19.640 skills that make me more valuable.  <br>00:02:20.880 So a company might hire me to dothe stuff I'm doing in my house.  <br>00:02:23.650 So it just makes sense if companiesare using Red Hat Enterprise Linux,  <br>00:02:27.120 the companies that may hire you one day,  <br>00:02:29.050 it makes sense to put thatinside your home network,  <br>00:02:31.240 inside your home laband learn how to use it.  <br>00:02:34.050 So maybe you can put on your resume,Hey I run this stuff at home now.  <br>00:02:37.560 Number two, why you might want to useit, why you should use it right now.  <br>00:02:40.040 If you're a company it's not free, butif you're you an individual, a person,  <br>00:02:45.070 make sure you check that I'm not a robotthing. Do a puzzle. Okay, you're good.  <br>00:02:48.560 You can sign up for Red Hat'sdeveloper for individual subscription,  <br>00:02:51.880 which includes a free versionof Red Hat Enterprise Lennox,  <br>00:02:55.240 and not just a free version. You canactually license up to 16 servers.  <br>00:02:58.680 And those servers can be asbeefy as you want them to be.  <br>00:03:01.240 So all you have to do right now ischeck my link in the description,  <br>00:03:03.600 get signed up and once you're loggedin you can check out your subscription.  <br>00:03:06.440 There's mine right here. I'veonly used one server so far.  <br>00:03:09.040 And to download your Red Hat EnterpriseLinux, go to downloads at the top Lyft,  <br>00:03:12.760 there it is right there.  <br>00:03:13.680 Click on the little icon here and saydownload latest and I'll grab that 9.1  <br>00:03:17.680 right now. The one thing I love about Rel,  <br>00:03:19.560 that's how the cool kits say it is theyhave a web console for your server,  <br>00:03:23.080 which is a beautiful gooey that allowsme to manage pretty much everything about  <br>00:03:26.680 my server, including containersrunning on that thing.  <br>00:03:29.810 So if you wanna run your homelab like an enterprise company,  <br>00:03:32.280 check out Red HatEnterprise Linux link below.  <br>00:03:34.720 That's what I'm gonna use rightnow to set up my CloudFlare Tunnel.  <br>00:03:37.280 I'm gonna head out to Google Domainsby Googling domains. We're here.  <br>00:03:40.600 I would like to get a new domain soI'll click on that search for man,  <br>00:03:44.360 what should it be? Hey, it'savailable, I'll take it.  <br>00:03:48.890 Go to car, check out. Bye. RegisteringCoffee break and it's mine.  <br>00:03:53.480 Step two, set up a CloudFlare account.I'll head out to [cloudflare.com](http://cloudflare.com/),  <br>00:03:57.520 click on sign up at the topright Elon musk@networkchuck.com  <br>00:04:02.600 password and create account.  <br>00:04:03.800 Make sure you check your emailand validate your email address.  <br>00:04:06.820 I'm gonna do that right now.  <br>00:04:07.980 And finally we can click on add site toadd a new site. It's what we want to do.  <br>00:04:12.400 Put in my new domain, Elon Musk [homelab.com](http://homelab.com/). Add site. Uh, don't get scared,  <br>00:04:16.760 scroll down a bit, it is free.Just click on free right there.  <br>00:04:19.959 They try to hide it fromyou. Click continue.  <br>00:04:21.899 Now no matter what domainprovider you're using,  <br>00:04:23.960 you'll need to use CloudFlare asyour name servers. How do we do that?  <br>00:04:27.320 I'm gonna show you rightnow. So here on this page,  <br>00:04:29.280 I'm gonna scroll down justa bit and click continue.  <br>00:04:31.360 And right here on step four,our Cloudflare's name server,  <br>00:04:34.920 whatever you have there,you'll use both of these.  <br>00:04:36.320 So I'm gonna jump backover to Google Domains,  <br>00:04:38.120 click on DNS and using my eyeballs,  <br>00:04:40.840 I'm gonna try and find custom nameservers. There it is right there.  <br>00:04:44.070 I wanna change my nameServers to something custom.Here we go. Copy Clarissa.  <br>00:04:47.760 Clarissa explains it all.Copy Evan. Click on save.  <br>00:04:50.480 And then Google's kind of tricky.  <br>00:04:51.720 You have to click on switchto these settings at the top.  <br>00:04:53.680 Once you do that and we're done. Nowthis could take a moment. They say,  <br>00:04:56.320 oh it can take up the 24 [hours.It](http://hours.it/) rarely does. It might though,  <br>00:04:59.570 so like don't get mad at me. Mineusually takes like a few moments.  <br>00:05:03.250 So getting back to CloudFlare,  <br>00:05:04.440 I'll click on done check name serversand I'll click on finish later for this,  <br>00:05:07.480 I'll do it later and I'll click oncheck name servers once more. Come on,  <br>00:05:10.160 really check it now it should reflecthere and you'll also receive an email  <br>00:05:13.160 telling you, hey it [happened.So](http://happened.so/) we'll give that a moment.  <br>00:05:15.560 Coffee break and lookat that. Mine is done.  <br>00:05:17.720 Took a little less than five minutesso not too bad time for step three,  <br>00:05:21.160 set up our CloudFlare tunnelhere in CloudFlare land.  <br>00:05:24.240 We're gonna scroll down just a bit onthe side panel and click on zero trust  <br>00:05:27.880 because you can't trust anyone exceptfor me. You can trust me and your mom.  <br>00:05:31.480 That's about it. Now you should behere at the Zero Trust dashboard.  <br>00:05:34.160 You can do a lot with it.We only care about tunnels.  <br>00:05:36.370 So we're gonna go over here and clickon the access tab right there and then  <br>00:05:39.960 click on tunnels and we do have a bitmore setup. We'll click on complete setup.  <br>00:05:43.240 Yes, yes, yes, we know. Click on nextto name our team. Elon Musk Comb Lap.  <br>00:05:46.910 Next again, scary pagewhere you're like, Chuck,  <br>00:05:48.880 I thought you said this was free and itis. It's just over here. Hidden kind of.  <br>00:05:51.760 I want the free plan.  <br>00:05:52.520 I'm selecting that Proceed to paymentof zero while they have to use that  <br>00:05:55.560 language. Now even though it is $0,  <br>00:05:57.840 it still doesn't want a payment on filesimilar to AWS and but it shouldn't  <br>00:06:01.880 charge you anything cuzagain, zero is zero, right?  <br>00:06:04.240 So let's click on next and then clickon purchase for our $0 purchase. Okay,  <br>00:06:08.720 we're good. Now we canactually click on tunnels.  <br>00:06:10.970 So let's get back to access and tunnelsand let's create our first tunnel.  <br>00:06:14.400 This is so crazy. Click on Create tunnel.  <br>00:06:16.480 Let's name it ElonMusk's House Save tunnel.  <br>00:06:20.180 And this is stupid easy. I told you youcould pretty much install this anywhere.  <br>00:06:23.840 They have all the flavors. Myfavorite flavor is gonna be Docker,  <br>00:06:27.120 but whatever you got,  <br>00:06:28.150 just click on these guys andI'll have the code you can run.  <br>00:06:30.680 So I'll click on Docker and I'll copythis snippet of code right here and here  <br>00:06:34.040 on my Red Hat Enterprise Linux machinewith Docker installed. Let's make sure,  <br>00:06:38.140 yes, I'm going to paste that code,  <br>00:06:40.280 although I will make one change herewhen I control A to get my cursor to the  <br>00:06:43.360 very beginning and just after a run,  <br>00:06:45.000 I'm gonna add a dash D for Damon soit runs in the background and then hit  <br>00:06:49.040 enter. Done. It's running sun. Now I getback to my cloud flare dashboard here.  <br>00:06:53.080 I'll click on next and time to routemy first service. So check this out,  <br>00:06:56.760 I'll do my proxima server first. SoI'll do prox mos, select my domain,  <br>00:07:00.280 which I already have set up Elon muskhome [lab.com](http://lab.com/). I'll select my service type,  <br>00:07:04.120 which will be HTTPS S for prox max.  <br>00:07:06.960 And then the internal privateIP address to my prox max server  <br>00:07:10.260 10 77, 73 port 8,006.  <br>00:07:14.660 Now you can see that CloudFlare Tunnelis acting kind of as a reverse proxy,  <br>00:07:18.670 except it's not exposing your homenetwork to the big bad internet.  <br>00:07:22.920 Insecurely unsecurely. It's safe.  <br>00:07:25.120 Now for services like Prox mos thathave self science certificates,  <br>00:07:28.110 I wanna click on additionalapplication settings.  <br>00:07:30.360 And under TLS I can say no TLSVerify. So it'll be okay with that.  <br>00:07:35.040 Then click on save Elon Musk'shouse tunnel and boom. So right now,  <br>00:07:39.000 a bunch of cool things happening.First, my tunnel is active.  <br>00:07:42.040 That means that whatever I did onmy Red Hat enterprise Lennox server,  <br>00:07:44.590 it's working. We're connected. I didn'thave to do anything to my firewall.  <br>00:07:47.950 I didn't have to really do much copy andpaste. You can do that. I can do that.  <br>00:07:52.200 It's awesome. Okay, anyways,so let's test it out.  <br>00:07:55.040 I'm gonna navigate out tocrocs mos dot elon musk home  <br>00:07:59.360 [lab.com](http://lab.com/) and it, it's working ,  <br>00:08:03.980 how cool is that? I'm logged in. Let'stry a connection from the outside.  <br>00:08:07.120 I'm gonna launch my chasm workspacehere, which is hosted in LE node.  <br>00:08:10.400 Open up a brave browser,  <br>00:08:11.600 which is outside my home network andI'll do the same thing I'm in and all the  <br>00:08:15.440 products mock stuff worksflawlessly. Check this out.  <br>00:08:17.800 One thing that doesn't work great withEngine X and traffic without a lot of  <br>00:08:22.680 work is the console. It works greathere. Now looking back at CloudFlare,  <br>00:08:26.400 all we need is that one tunnel foreverything. So if I click on configure,  <br>00:08:29.910 I can add more public hostnames. Let's add another one.  <br>00:08:32.720 Let's add my Sonology nass.  <br>00:08:34.159 So I'll just do NASS elonmusk home [lab.com](http://lab.com/) type HTS URL  <br>00:08:39.289 on port 5,001. I'll make surethere's no TLS Verify save host name.  <br>00:08:43.679 Let's test it out. Nas dot elon musk [homelab.com](http://homelab.com/) and look at that . How,  <br>00:08:47.760 how easy was that?  <br>00:08:48.990 I don't have to worry about let's encryptcertificates or really just anything.  <br>00:08:53.170 It just, it just works. And there's thatbeautiful SSL shirt right there, man.  <br>00:08:57.960 Now you gotta admit that's the easiestway you've seen to expose your home  <br>00:09:02.000 network's resources tothe internet. I mean,  <br>00:09:04.040 just a few clicks and you can host yourown website on a raspberry pie inside  <br>00:09:07.720 your house no matter whattype of network you have,  <br>00:09:09.660 and people can securely access it.CloudFlare is changing the game.  <br>00:09:12.900 Let me know if you, um, hacked to YouTubetoday that like boat notification,  <br>00:09:16.640 bell comment, subscribe. You gotta hackYouTube today ethically, of course.  <br>00:09:19.960 And for real, just let me know belowif you did this and how cool it is.  <br>00:09:23.680 I just wanna, I wanna geek out with you,so get some coffee and let's geek out.|### SUMMARY  <br>Me presenting a video on exposing home networks securely to the internet using CloudFlare Tunnel.  <br>  <br>### IDEAS:  <br>- Exposing your home

You need to deploy it.  <br>00:00:03.360 Not only is it free and open source,which I don't know how that's possible,  <br>00:00:06.570 but you're gonna learn so much abouthacking and security while also protecting  <br>00:00:10.500 your stuff. It's a no-brainer.  <br>00:00:11.760 I deployed the server in about fiveminutes and then deployed agents to all of  <br>00:00:15.066 my computers and servers,Mac, windows, Lennox.  <br>00:00:17.670 Now these agents are like the tattletalesin school. They tell me everything.  <br>00:00:21.270 Things like security configurationare all my devices misconfigured?  <br>00:00:24.240 I don't know, but I do Now it'll checkfor known vulnerabilities, malware,  <br>00:00:27.660 and then this is kind of nuts.  <br>00:00:28.950 It can track a directory and see if anychanges occurred, files added removed,  <br>00:00:33.090 documents edited, andthis is even crazier.  <br>00:00:35.100 It can track the changes to theWindows registry. Are you kidding me?  <br>00:00:38.130 It's amazing.  <br>00:00:38.820 So all these devices send all theinformation to my server and I can see  <br>00:00:42.030 everything from onelocation. I get alerts,  <br>00:00:44.430 which can come at me viaemail or Slack or whatever.  <br>00:00:46.800 I can do things in response tothose alerts. Active response.  <br>00:00:49.775 So not only can I detect a brute forceattack, I can do something about it.  <br>00:00:53.490 Block that IP, address. Thisserver or this tool is called waza.  <br>00:00:56.910 It's a type of cybersecuritytool called asim,  <br>00:00:59.190 security Information and Event Management.But I so badly wanna call it a siem.  <br>00:01:03.360 I'm gonna call it a siem. I don't care.  <br>00:01:04.800 This type of tool is what the blue teamor defensive side of cybersecurity will  <br>00:01:08.340 use to defend against the bad guys tostop the hackers. So on this video,  <br>00:01:11.910 I'm gonna show you how to deploy thiscuz you need to. It's amazing. Again,  <br>00:01:15.390 not only will you beprotecting your stuff,  <br>00:01:17.340 but you're gonna learn so much and it'salso kind of addicting. And seriously,  <br>00:01:21.210 this is something you could probably puton your resume. This is a project like,  <br>00:01:24.060 hey, I run my own seam,sim seam seam seams.  <br>00:01:28.740 Pretty cool, doesn't it? ,I That was lame. I'm sorry.  <br>00:01:31.830 So you're convinced, let's talk aboutwhat you need. Really only two things.  <br>00:01:34.740 A Linux server or computer and somethingto monitor. So other computers,  <br>00:01:39.570 most flavors of Lennox are supported.I'll be installing it on Ubuntu.  <br>00:01:42.840 And more specifically, I'll be on a cloudmachine in ano. That's what I prefer.  <br>00:01:46.860 So I can monitor everything withease and also it's ridiculously easy.  <br>00:01:50.520 I'll walk you through it here ina bit. But it can also be on-prem,  <br>00:01:53.010 on a server you already have. Orit can be on a Docker container.  <br>00:01:55.770 Lemme get some room here, alreadygot a room, scoot down. There we go.  <br>00:01:58.680 And they even have an ova foreasy deployment on virtual box.  <br>00:02:01.740 Now as far as systemrequirements for the Wza server,  <br>00:02:04.290 lemme show you what theyrecommend. At minimum,  <br>00:02:06.120 they want two gigs of RAM and two CPUcores. That'll work for most people.  <br>00:02:10.080 If you got a lot of devices, if you'regonna be collecting lots of logs,  <br>00:02:12.395 you wanna go larger. Four gigs ofRam and eight CPU cores. Now again,  <br>00:02:16.320 I'm gonna walk you through the cloudoption and then also sprinkle in a little  <br>00:02:19.110 bit of dog or two just for fun. Oh,almost forgot the most important thing.  <br>00:02:22.260 Coffee. Everything in it requirescoffee. It's just the rules.  <br>00:02:27.900 Network.  <br>00:02:28.110 Chuck.coffee first. All we'll setup. Waza or wsu, I'm not sure.  <br>00:02:31.230 I'm just gonna call it waza in the cloud.  <br>00:02:33.065 So let's head on over to [od.com/networkchuck](http://od.com/networkchuck) or check the link below.  <br>00:02:37.350 Now not only is LY nodethe sponsor of this video,  <br>00:02:39.540 but they are my favorite cloud provider.Like I'm not lying, check this up.  <br>00:02:42.450 I have way too many virtual machines inthe cloud because I just go in here and  <br>00:02:46.050 spin up something.Anytime I have a project,  <br>00:02:47.940 anytime I wanna mess withsomething, I just go to LE Node,  <br>00:02:50.460 spin up a quick virtual machine inseconds. Now if you're new to LE Node,  <br>00:02:53.760 this is gonna be free foryou. For the first 60 days,  <br>00:02:56.010 they're gonna give you $100 creditto go crazy and play around with it.  <br>00:02:59.140 So if you haven't already,  <br>00:02:59.920 go ahead and get signed up right nowand then get signed in and meet me back  <br>00:03:02.950 here.  <br>00:03:03.280 Now the other reason I love Le Node isthey make deploying virtual machines like  <br>00:03:06.130 waza. Super stinking easy. Check thisout. I'm gonna go to create Lin node.  <br>00:03:09.730 I'll click on Marketplace and thenI'll search for waza. There it is.  <br>00:03:13.390 Let's go and click on that and justhave it selected and we'll scroll down a  <br>00:03:16.215 bit.  <br>00:03:16.420 Now time for just a little bit of configFirst put an email address then for the  <br>00:03:19.810 SSL certificate. Then a limitedpseudo user account, Bernard hack.  <br>00:03:23.410 Well this can beanything. Just make it up.  <br>00:03:24.940 Put a password in and we'll scrolldown just a little bit until we see.  <br>00:03:28.600 Select an image. We'reusing Ubuntu Perfect region.  <br>00:03:31.450 Select somewhere close toyou. Leno is a cloud provider.  <br>00:03:33.430 So they have data centers everywhere.  <br>00:03:35.080 Pick somewhere close to you so it'llbe nice and fast. I'm in Dallas.  <br>00:03:37.960 And finally our LE node plan. Fromhere, let's click on share. At cpu,  <br>00:03:41.080 they're cheaper. And here we have ourplans or the size of our virtual machine.  <br>00:03:44.440 Now normally I would pick this oneright here. It's five bucks a month,  <br>00:03:47.320 super cheap. But for waza, you wantsomething a bit beefier, a bit bigger,  <br>00:03:51.010 something more like theLE node, four gigabyte.  <br>00:03:52.870 Now if you don't select the four gigabyteoption for this WASA installation,  <br>00:03:56.380 it just won't work. I tried [it.So](http://it.so/) just make sure you select this.  <br>00:03:59.530 Now if you do wanna go for a smalleroption, like the LE node, two gigabyte,  <br>00:04:02.470 I actually got that working withDocker and it worked pretty well.  <br>00:04:05.170 I'll walk you through that here in asecond. Well, let's go ahead and do this.  <br>00:04:07.390 It's really not much more. It'sso easy. So select four gigabyte.  <br>00:04:10.330 Scroll down just a bit, labelthis sucker, whatever you want.  <br>00:04:14.140 Enter a root password.  <br>00:04:15.280 And finally we'll scroll down and clickon create LE node at the bottom right.  <br>00:04:18.790 Ready, set, go. Nowit's gonna do its thing.  <br>00:04:21.250 It's gonna bake you a VM inthe cloud. Quick coffee break,  <br>00:04:26.410 it'll be a few minutes. And once yousee that your LE node is running,  <br>00:04:29.830 we can try and connect to it. Overhere we have our SSH access command.  <br>00:04:32.980 We're gonna go ahead and copy thisright here and then launch your terminal  <br>00:04:35.770 Windows, Mac and Linux. It'll allwork. And paste that in there. Enter,  <br>00:04:39.340 accept all fingerprints. Putyour password in and we're in.  <br>00:04:42.550 But it may not be quite ready. Waza isstill going through its installation.  <br>00:04:46.060 We can monitor it kind of rightnow by typing in H top H T O P.  <br>00:04:50.530 And we'll see right at the top there,the top process. D P K G or D package.  <br>00:04:55.000 That's how apps on Linux are installedand that's what's happening right now.  <br>00:04:58.240 So we can kinda sit there andwatch that until that stops.  <br>00:05:00.645 And we can try to connect herein a moment and like see here,  <br>00:05:02.470 we have some wza stuff there. TheWZA index year is being installed.  <br>00:05:05.770 There's a bunch of pieces toit. It's amazing. But again,  <br>00:05:07.780 quick coffee break andwatch the magic happen.  <br>00:05:11.020 Now at this point it's been aboutsix minutes. Let's see if it's done.  <br>00:05:13.930 And we'll start with grabbingour password. By the way,  <br>00:05:16.090 I hit control C to get out of that,  <br>00:05:17.560 if we type in LS dash aland our terminal here,  <br>00:05:20.590 we should see a dot deploymentdash secrets dot txc file.  <br>00:05:24.670 There it has our secrets or ourpasswords. Let's go ahead and cap that.  <br>00:05:27.430 Cats dot deployment secrets,blah blah. Got it. Bam.  <br>00:05:30.280 There's our passwords right there.  <br>00:05:31.360 The first one we want is theadmin password at the top.  <br>00:05:33.580 Got our admin username and our adminpassword. Cool, keep that there.  <br>00:05:36.880 Let's go back to ourLE node dashboard here.  <br>00:05:38.650 And we're gonna grab our LE node reverseDNS name or R D N S. So here Leno node.  <br>00:05:42.880 Click on the network tab.  <br>00:05:44.170 Scroll down just a little bit untilwe see the IP addresses section.  <br>00:05:47.830 And then we have the reverse DNS righthere. There it is. Just go and grab that,  <br>00:05:51.850 copy it.  <br>00:05:52.600 Open a new tab and go to https colonwhack whack paste that in .  <br>00:05:57.650 Here we go. It's there. Now let's getlogged in. Use your name admin password.  <br>00:06:01.700 Let's grab that from the terminalthere. It's copy and paste.  <br>00:06:05.870 It's gonna check and make sure thingsare good. Almost there or good. Awesome.  <br>00:06:09.560 This seems pretty cool. Last timeI'll do that joke. Probably not.  <br>00:06:13.310 Seems like a ock. Sorry .It's terrible. Now before we move on,  <br>00:06:17.180 I'm gonna show the dockerinstall. It's super easy.  <br>00:06:19.910 If you don't care about that,that's fine. Just skip ahead.  <br>00:06:22.015 I've got timestamps below. Nowhere's the docker install. Perfect.  <br>00:06:24.800 Four on-prem or a smaller machine on LEnode, which is what I'll be doing here.  <br>00:06:28.790 Leno. I'm gonna click on create le node.  <br>00:06:30.620 I'll just deploy a standardUbuntu 2204 lts machine,  <br>00:06:35.300 shared cpu. I know that the LEnode, two gigabyte plan will work.  <br>00:06:38.990 I tried it on the one gig, the containersjust wouldn't run. Don't try it.  <br>00:06:42.260 But the two gig plan, it worked [great.So](http://great.so/) click that, label it something fun,  <br>00:06:45.560 put a password in and then click oncreate le node. How fast was that?  <br>00:06:49.340 Now if you're doing this on-prem,  <br>00:06:50.450 just have a server that's running Dockerand of course if you want to run the  <br>00:06:53.600 ova, I'll put a link below and wassdocumentation. After a moment or two,  <br>00:06:57.140 you should see that your machine isrunning. Let's go and connect to it.  <br>00:07:00.110 We'll grab our SSH access command overhere. Just copy that. Launch my terminal,  <br>00:07:03.830 paste it, head enter, accept allfingerprints, password. And we're in.  <br>00:07:07.730 Couple things we'll do real quick.First we'll update our repositories.  <br>00:07:10.250 Pseudo a P t update. Now many of you'regonna go, why is he doing pseudo?  <br>00:07:13.730 You're route. I always do pseudocause I don't know what you're using.  <br>00:07:17.330 You may not be root right now. I justwanna make it simple. Anyways, I digress.  <br>00:07:21.650 Pseudo PT update to update ourrepositories. Once that finishes up,  <br>00:07:24.830 we'll do a pseudo PT andinstall [docker.io](http://docker.io/) and docker  <br>00:07:29.630 dash compose. We'll doa dash y at the end.  <br>00:07:32.420 This is going to install dockerand Docker compose. So let's go.  <br>00:07:35.420 Should be fairly quick. More of a coffeesip here. Awesome, it is finished.  <br>00:07:39.650 The next step, I've got a link below.  <br>00:07:41.120 Go ahead and pull up the Wazadocumentation for a docker deployment.  <br>00:07:44.480 Well one two punch this real quick.  <br>00:07:45.800 First we'll clone the get repositoryone command. Let's copy that.  <br>00:07:49.100 Go back to your terminal, paste thatcommand assuming you have get installed.  <br>00:07:52.130 Most oss do clone. Awesome type in Ls.  <br>00:07:54.710 We'll see a new directorycalled waza Docker.  <br>00:07:56.960 Let's go ahead and CD into that cd,waza, Docker type in LS once more.  <br>00:08:01.280 And we have one moredirectory we wanna jump into.  <br>00:08:03.650 It's the single node directory becausewe're deploying one single node or  <br>00:08:07.250 computer cd single node. Perfect.  <br>00:08:10.520 Now the next thing we'll have to do isgenerate some self sign certificates.  <br>00:08:13.880 They make that super easy for us.  <br>00:08:15.145 They even have a Docker composefile to run and do that for us.  <br>00:08:18.080 And all we have to do iscopy and paste this command.  <br>00:08:19.820 So copy this command right here,paste that in there, hit enter.  <br>00:08:23.810 It's gonna pull those images down.Run, compose. And then that was it.  <br>00:08:27.410 That's done. Now for our next step,  <br>00:08:28.880 all we have to do is do thedocker dash compose command  <br>00:08:33.740 with the up option. And then we'll do adash D to launch it in the background.  <br>00:08:37.730 This will do everything for us. Thisis our last step in deploying this.  <br>00:08:40.700 It's super easy. I love docker. Ready,set, go. This will take a moment.  <br>00:08:45.320 It's deploying a multi-tierapplication, pulling all the images,  <br>00:08:48.740 a lot of stuff going on. Little coffeebreak. We'll give it some time here.  <br>00:08:51.740 Okay, deployment is done, done, done.  <br>00:08:54.110 Let's confirm real quickby typing in docker stats.  <br>00:08:57.780 Get a realtime view of those suckersrunning. Let's go get logged in.  <br>00:09:00.930 Let's check it out. We'll getback to our Leno dashboard here.  <br>00:09:03.360 Go to the network tab. Scrolldown just a little bit,  <br>00:09:05.640 find our reverse DNS name righthere in the IP addresses section.  <br>00:09:09.690 Go ahead and copy that and we'llopen up a new tab. Type in https,  <br>00:09:13.200 colon whack whack, paste that inthere. Let's go. Fingers crossed. Okay,  <br>00:09:16.800 this is a self-signed cert. We'll getthis little error message. No big deal.  <br>00:09:19.710 Should proceed. Was that sorry. Um,this video has so many lame jokes.  <br>00:09:23.460 Let's get logged in. Default. Login willbe admin password will be according to.  <br>00:09:27.660 Was it documentation? Whatwas it? Was it ? Sorry.  <br>00:09:32.400 Sorry, not sorry. Oh, it's uh, secretpassword. Capital S. Capital P.  <br>00:09:36.360 Easy enough. Just gotta check and makesure things are good. Almost. Okay,  <br>00:09:40.200 things are good. Now thatwe have, was it installed?  <br>00:09:42.720 Let's get some agents added.Computers that we can monitor.  <br>00:09:45.150 So right here we'll click on addagent right here in the dashboard.  <br>00:09:48.330 And then right here we'll havethe option to deploy a new agent.  <br>00:09:51.330 Go ahead and click on that. Thisis super straightforward and easy.  <br>00:09:53.760 We'll start with theLinux host first. Again,  <br>00:09:55.410 I'm gonna do Ubuntu and we'll doa Windows after this. By the way,  <br>00:09:57.990 Ubuntu 15 or more architecture is X 86.  <br>00:10:01.170 But notice we have optionsfor everything. It's awesome.  <br>00:10:03.690 Then we'll put our was aserver address in here.  <br>00:10:05.520 This will simply be your LE node,  <br>00:10:06.930 reverse DNS name if you did it withme or it could be an IP address.  <br>00:10:09.480 Just something that the agent can haveaccess to. So I'll copy that server.  <br>00:10:12.660 Address the F Q D N fully qualifieddomain name just like this.  <br>00:10:16.770 I will name that agent. It's optionalbut I like to Callie underscore Linux.  <br>00:10:21.300 We'll select a group. I'llput it in the default group.  <br>00:10:23.460 And then on step six they give you onecommand to install the agent. Super cool.  <br>00:10:27.180 Super easy. Let's copy that. Copy command.  <br>00:10:29.190 And then here in Cali I'll launch myterminal. Paste that command head,  <br>00:10:32.340 enter pseudo password and it's done.Cool. One more thing we have to do,  <br>00:10:37.260 getting back to the was a dashboard.We need to enable this as a service.  <br>00:10:40.385 We'll just copy this. Commandall system, CTL commands,  <br>00:10:42.870 paste those commands in there,head enter and done. Awesome.  <br>00:10:46.410 So now getting back to the WASA dashboard.  <br>00:10:48.270 We can go to the top left here onthis drop down and click on agents.  <br>00:10:51.390 There it is right there. My first littleguy, Callie Lennox, his IP address os.  <br>00:10:56.310 And it's gonna show us so much more.Oh, I can't wait to show you this,  <br>00:10:59.135 but first, before we do that,let's add Windows real quick.  <br>00:11:01.260 But notice how fast and easy thisis and Windows. It's just as easy.  <br>00:11:04.020 Let's go ahead and douh, deploy new agent.  <br>00:11:06.000 Once more this time we'llclick on Windows. Goodness,  <br>00:11:08.790 they still have WindowsXP in here. .  <br>00:11:11.280 I guess you need a scenefor this man. But anyways,  <br>00:11:13.500 I'm on Windows seven or more orgreater. No Windows arm support, sad,  <br>00:11:16.950 fully qualified domain name would be oursame. I uh, domain name or IP address.  <br>00:11:20.700 Again, just something your agent can haveaccess to. I'll name it default group.  <br>00:11:24.330 And finally at step six, just like Linux,  <br>00:11:26.430 we're gonna have our littleone-liner command using PowerShell.  <br>00:11:29.280 Keeping in mind you will need to runthis as administrator cause you will need  <br>00:11:32.580 admin privileges. So I'lljust copy that command,  <br>00:11:34.680 jump into my Windows computer here.  <br>00:11:36.870 So here in Windows I'lllaunch my Windows terminal.  <br>00:11:38.850 Keeping in mind I'll haveto launch it as admin.  <br>00:11:40.740 So right click this and click on run asadministrator. Pace my command in there,  <br>00:11:44.430 hit enter. Gonna do its thing.And then one more command.  <br>00:11:47.010 We'll have to start theservice here on Windows.  <br>00:11:48.990 Just like Linux net start was a SVCwas a is starting and we're off to the  <br>00:11:53.410 races. Let's go check Waza, the Wazadashboard. We'll go to our agents.  <br>00:11:56.710 Oh there it is. It's still coming up.  <br>00:11:58.330 Let's click on refresh over here onthe right. Refresh, refresh, refresh.  <br>00:12:01.420 Come on. Connect. I'm impatient.And after a billion refreshes. No,  <br>00:12:04.240 I'm just kidding. It was likethree. Um, it's up. Awesome.  <br>00:12:07.120 And here's our two machines at Lennoxand Windows. And you know what,  <br>00:12:10.540 I wanna add one morejust for fun. Ready Go.  <br>00:12:14.050 It was seriously actuallyalmost that fast.  <br>00:12:16.090 So here we have our agents and now let'sclick on one of these and see what's  <br>00:12:19.150 going on. This is gonna be [fun.So](http://fun.so/) I'm gonna click on the new one.  <br>00:12:21.280 I just added the Circs network. Chuck,that's from my CIRCS search video.  <br>00:12:25.780 It's a public box and it'sgonna be kind of fun to look at.  <br>00:12:28.065 It's click on that guy. And here's ouragent dashboard for this one computer,  <br>00:12:31.360 this one server. There's a lot going on.  <br>00:12:33.100 But just keep in mindat the top here in Waza,  <br>00:12:34.720 we kind of have breadcrumbsand I love this.  <br>00:12:36.520 We've got agents and we're drilled downinto the specific agent we're looking  <br>00:12:39.645 at. And then here at thedashboard, so much going on.  <br>00:12:42.430 Now I'm not gonna show youeverything. There's way too much,  <br>00:12:44.530 way too much fun to be had.  <br>00:12:45.705 But I will point out a fewthings that are like kind of wow.  <br>00:12:48.250 First the Mitre framework.The Mitre attack framework.  <br>00:12:51.340 We won't go too deep into this,  <br>00:12:52.510 but just know it's a database of hackingtechniques that hackers will use to  <br>00:12:55.720 attack machines. This will look atthat framework and tell you, Hey,  <br>00:12:59.710 your machine might be vulnerable to this,  <br>00:13:01.840 these tactics or your machine isactively being attacked in these ways.  <br>00:13:06.190 And notice, um, some thingsare happening to mine.  <br>00:13:08.470 We'll take a look at those here ina bit. And then quick drive by here.  <br>00:13:11.350 Compliance. Many companies have to obeycertain compliance standards like pci,  <br>00:13:15.145 gdpr, nist, hipaa. This willcheck all your computers,  <br>00:13:18.580 all your servers and tell you what'sgoing on. That's kind of crazy. Now,  <br>00:13:22.270 you may not care about policies. Youshould if you wanna get into security,  <br>00:13:25.000 but it may not be important foryou right now. Scroll down a bit.  <br>00:13:27.100 What about configuration? Is your serveror your computer configured securely?  <br>00:13:30.490 Do you know that for a fact?Well this will tell you .  <br>00:13:33.070 It has a module called SCAor secure configuration.  <br>00:13:36.370 I think it's audit or assessment,secure configuration assessment.  <br>00:13:39.610 And it will pull out a C I S assessment.  <br>00:13:42.040 This is for buntu Linux andtell you how good you are. Um,  <br>00:13:44.770 39% on my score failed 715 of these.  <br>00:13:48.040 Now let me give you like kind ofa baseline for what that means.  <br>00:13:50.020 Let's jump into this report.Notice here in the breadcrumbs,  <br>00:13:52.000 I did jump into the security configurationassessment section and it'll tell me  <br>00:13:55.480 all the things I failed at. Let meactually sort by. Uh, good stuff.  <br>00:13:58.750 It's gonna be a small list. Andmost of this is like default.  <br>00:14:00.970 So like App Armor is installed cool,  <br>00:14:03.010 but it'll go deeper and tell you thingslike hey you should disable USB storage.  <br>00:14:05.860 If that drill down to SSH cuz you cansearch for specific things like that.  <br>00:14:08.740 Keyword . It'll tell me thingslike, hey don't install Telenet.  <br>00:14:11.860 U F W is not enabled.Disable ssh sh root login.  <br>00:14:14.920 So not only is it showingyou like hey you're insecure,  <br>00:14:17.080 but it's also teaching you. Causeif I click on any one of these,  <br>00:14:19.420 it'll tell me like, Heyhere's the rationale, here'swhy we're telling you this.  <br>00:14:22.360 Here's how you fix it,here's how you check it.  <br>00:14:24.520 And then it shows you all the miretechniques that can be used against having  <br>00:14:27.765 that misconfiguration. That's sofreaking powerful. Are you kidding me?  <br>00:14:31.270 It's okay, I'm getting a littleexcited coffee, you'll calm me down.  <br>00:14:35.440 That's just one module speed mode. Let'sget back to our agent dashboard here.  <br>00:14:38.890 Here on the menu we have security eventsshowing you things like authentication  <br>00:14:41.800 failures, which could be brute forceattacks. It'll show you top five alerts.  <br>00:14:45.280 It'll give you a list ofsecurity alerts. Super powerful.  <br>00:14:47.890 And then here's something you're notgonna see right away. If I click on more,  <br>00:14:50.770 we have vulnerabilities.  <br>00:14:52.580 It'll check your system forvulnerabilities but it'snot enabled by default.  <br>00:14:55.400 I'll show you how to dothis here in a moment.  <br>00:14:57.230 But I have another system I alreadyhad up and running and if I look at  <br>00:14:59.870 vulnerabilities for that one,  <br>00:15:01.490 it's gonna check all myapplications and tell me like, Hey,  <br>00:15:04.310 are there known CBEs out thereor common vulnerabilities?  <br>00:15:07.640 And I've got a bunch likea lot. But just look at this,  <br>00:15:11.300 deploy this for your house or yourservers or whatever you have and play  <br>00:15:14.390 security admin. Go in here and go,oh wow, I've got 170 critical CDEs.  <br>00:15:18.680 I should go figure out how to fixthose. The learning opportunity.  <br>00:15:21.740 Are you kidding me? And then hereon my server I already had going.  <br>00:15:24.260 I do wanna show you one thing here on oneof my Windows hosts or Windows agents.  <br>00:15:28.400 This is kind of fun. I have my daughter'scomputer here, this is amazing.  <br>00:15:31.010 Check this out. I'll click on Chloe.  <br>00:15:32.720 And the one thing you're gonna loveabout Windows Host is the integrity  <br>00:15:36.170 monitoring module. Oh my gosh,thing's amazing. Check it out.  <br>00:15:39.830 The sucker's gonna monitor all theimportant files and registry keys that are  <br>00:15:44.360 normally modified whensomething's being hacked.  <br>00:15:46.400 It's gonna look at things and tellyou when things are being adjusted.  <br>00:15:48.830 So like check this out. If I go to events,  <br>00:15:50.570 it'll tell me each time aregister key is changed.  <br>00:15:52.550 Like this one was deleted firewallpolicy. I don't know why that happened.  <br>00:15:55.640 Now some of these are automatic,like the Windows OS is doing it,  <br>00:15:58.370 but others can be bad. It's gotta crazy.  <br>00:16:01.580 And it's not just registry keys.If I go to inventory over here,  <br>00:16:03.950 I can see that it hasinventory of the files,  <br>00:16:05.390 it's monitoring and all the registry keys,  <br>00:16:07.190 it's monitoring and what they'recurrently set to. Is it not insane?  <br>00:16:09.890 And here in a moment I'llshow you how you can s uh,  <br>00:16:11.575 monitor specific keys and get alerts onthose keys and files too. It's so fun.  <br>00:16:15.950 Now at this point your seamseems to be doing great. I lied,  <br>00:16:19.220 I was gonna do it one more [time.It](http://time.it/) seems to be doing pretty good.  <br>00:16:21.260 Pretty much all youhave to do is set it up,  <br>00:16:23.060 connect an agent to it and it collectsinformation and you can go crazy and  <br>00:16:26.750 learn cybersecurity andstart to protect your stuff.  <br>00:16:29.660 But you can also tinker with this quitea bit. You can enable more modules,  <br>00:16:32.690 set up more alerts, monitor morethings. So if you're interested in that,  <br>00:16:35.815 we're gonna walk througha few more options here.  <br>00:16:37.910 Now the first thing we'll do is lookat file monitoring through Windows.  <br>00:16:41.120 It's so powerful and so cool. Soback here at the WASA incense,  <br>00:16:44.810 I deployed with youright now in this video.  <br>00:16:46.700 Couple things real quick justbefore we jump into that.  <br>00:16:48.530 If I click on the home icon,  <br>00:16:49.610 it's gonna take me to the WASA dashboardand it's gonna show me like all the  <br>00:16:52.040 modules I could jump into. So for example,if I wanna jump into security events,  <br>00:16:55.340 it's gonna show me security events.  <br>00:16:56.480 But right now it's beingfiltered to look at one agent.  <br>00:16:59.030 I can unpin that to where it's showingme everything from every agent.  <br>00:17:02.270 That's pretty cool. And you can do thatwith most modules. Let's go back home.  <br>00:17:05.060 Now let's click on Waza oncemore. Will Waza drop down here?  <br>00:17:08.030 Let's click on agents. Now again,I'm not going over everything.  <br>00:17:10.940 Every little thing you can do and youdon't have to know all these things,  <br>00:17:13.520 but you can play aroundwith it. You can go crazy.  <br>00:17:16.310 I'm just giving you enough to getstarted and have a little bit of fun and  <br>00:17:18.710 things I got really excited [about.So](http://about.so/) let's click on agents here.  <br>00:17:21.170 We'll click on my Windows machine.  <br>00:17:22.640 A couple things I'm gonnashow you real quick.  <br>00:17:23.960 If I click on Integrity Monitoring,  <br>00:17:25.339 this is the module thatwe'll use to monitor files.  <br>00:17:28.160 Notice I don't have any events right now.  <br>00:17:29.540 I've got it filtered right now by thelast 24 hours and I've just connected this  <br>00:17:32.900 thing, nothing's happened.But if I go to the inventory,  <br>00:17:35.240 I can see that it already has scannedand inventoried all the default files.  <br>00:17:39.260 It'll look for in thedirectories. And my registry keys.  <br>00:17:41.600 I believe it's set to scaneverything every 12 hours.  <br>00:17:45.020 And if it notices a change, it'll letyou know. It'll alert you. Pretty cool.  <br>00:17:47.870 But with files we can also do realtime notification and rule set.  <br>00:17:51.450 Check this out.  <br>00:17:52.290 I'm gonna jump into my Windows host andchange some configuration for the agent  <br>00:17:55.830 file. Now you can find that here.I'm gonna go to my Windows Explorer,  <br>00:17:58.530 go to my C Drive, goto program files X 86.  <br>00:18:01.440 Now if this is all like weird foryou, like oh man Windows file system,  <br>00:18:03.990 I don't know what's going on.  <br>00:18:05.190 I do detail a lot of what this meansand how it's organized in my Windows  <br>00:18:08.910 Fundamentals course on my academy.Check it out, link below. Anyways,  <br>00:18:12.120 let's continue. It's an X 86 andin a folder called OS sec Agent,  <br>00:18:16.920 jump in there. Continue.You gotta have admin access.  <br>00:18:19.680 If I scroll down just a bit,I'll see a file named os [sec.com](http://sec.com/).  <br>00:18:23.430 That's your configurationfile for your agent.  <br>00:18:25.320 Let's go to open that with notepad.Open with notepad. Oh, by the way,  <br>00:18:28.920 you can do the same thing on Linux.I'll put documentation below.  <br>00:18:31.980 It's pretty much the same process, justediting the same type of agent file.  <br>00:18:35.430 But let's walk through thisreal quick here in this file,  <br>00:18:36.930 I'm just gonna search for sis checkto get to the SIS check section.  <br>00:18:41.760 That's hard to say.. And here right uh,  <br>00:18:44.100 you can see that I have the fileintegrity monitoring section.  <br>00:18:47.040 And you can see right here all thedirectories that is by default set to  <br>00:18:50.760 monitor.  <br>00:18:51.390 So what we'll do here is we'll justchoose a place amongst all these directory  <br>00:18:54.515 options and we'll add alittle configuration here.  <br>00:18:57.570 We'll type in directories and we'lladd an option that'll give us real time  <br>00:19:00.630 alerts. It's really simple what'scalled real time, just like that.  <br>00:19:04.025 Have it equal yes in quotes.  <br>00:19:05.310 We'll add one more optionreport underscore changes.  <br>00:19:08.400 Have that equal yes in quotes andwe'll add one more check underscore  <br>00:19:13.140 all and have that equal yes as well.  <br>00:19:15.780 So just to make sure we'reall on the same page here,  <br>00:19:17.370 we're specifying a directory and we'regiving it these options real time. Yes,  <br>00:19:21.150 report changes, yes. And checkall. Yes, we'll close that out.  <br>00:19:24.510 And then add the directory. We'regonna monitor with all these options.  <br>00:19:27.330 Let's see to our desktop.  <br>00:19:28.140 So we'll do CE colon slashusers slash your username.  <br>00:19:32.520 Mine is network check slash desktop.  <br>00:19:35.220 And then we'll close that out with aleft arrow forward slash directories just  <br>00:19:39.900 like this. So now we'llsave this file, file save.  <br>00:19:42.060 And then we'll restart the service bylaunching our terminal as administrator.  <br>00:19:44.940 Right click run as administratorand we'll say restart service.  <br>00:19:49.140 Dash name waza. [Cool.So](http://cool.so/) that should be good.  <br>00:19:52.140 So I'm gonna open up myWaza dashboard real quick.  <br>00:19:53.850 Make sure I'm on the events tab.Notice and look at the last 24 hours,  <br>00:19:57.060 nothing's happened. Let'schange something on our desktop.  <br>00:19:59.460 This is so cool and powerful. I hopethis illustrates how cool this is.  <br>00:20:02.250 She's gonna go to my desktop and I'mgonna add a new file, new text document.  <br>00:20:06.210 Can you see this? Just takeabout five seconds. One, two,  <br>00:20:10.830 let's take a look. Let'srefresh this. .  <br>00:20:15.030 There it is. No, it's weird.I said added, deleted, added.  <br>00:20:17.850 Oh I think because they changedthe name in real time. But look,  <br>00:20:20.070 it monitored that I add a new, uh, anew file. Um, check this out. So that's,  <br>00:20:23.190 that's one alert. If I change anythingabout it, let's open it up. Say, Hey,  <br>00:20:27.090 I'm changing stuff. We'll save it,we'll see if the new alert comes in.  <br>00:20:30.030 I'll refresh my optionshere or refresh my page.  <br>00:20:32.520 There it is sis check eventmodified. And it's like, Hey,  <br>00:20:35.670 the check sum changed on this.  <br>00:20:37.350 It'll even tell me down herewhat I changed the text Iadded. How crazy is that?  <br>00:20:41.880 Now we can do the same kind ofthing with the Windows registry.  <br>00:20:44.070 Now it won't be real time,they don't have that option,  <br>00:20:46.590 but it will scan every 12 hours.You can change that interval.  <br>00:20:49.300 Let me share real quick. We can [specify.So](http://specify.so/) right now Pilic was an inventory,  <br>00:20:53.170 right? We can see that it does havean inventory. Look at our new file.  <br>00:20:56.710 It does have an inventory of registeredkeys that automatically monitors,  <br>00:20:59.920 but we can add specific onesthat we want to have seen.  <br>00:21:02.050 So let's add a custom one real quick.  <br>00:21:03.460 I'll open up a red edit herein Windows to edit my registry.  <br>00:21:07.090 Let's add one inside. Uh, I don't know,hq, local machine. We'll go to software,  <br>00:21:11.440 maybe classes. And let's add oneright here, right click say New key,  <br>00:21:16.420 we'll say Bernard Hack. Well bam,  <br>00:21:20.080 we'll change the value to something fun.  <br>00:21:22.780 So what I'll do here is I'll right clickthis key and say copy key name and then  <br>00:21:26.590 we'll go back to ouragent configuration file.  <br>00:21:28.960 And you'll notice just under that samekind of section where we're adding  <br>00:21:31.660 directories, we also haveregistry keys we can add.  <br>00:21:34.240 So I'll go kind oftowards the bottom here,  <br>00:21:35.860 just underneath the last registry entryand right before the entry to ignore,  <br>00:21:41.590 I'll line myself up with everythingelse, type in Windows registry,  <br>00:21:46.390 paste my key name,  <br>00:21:47.680 and then close it out with a left arrowforward slash Windows registry and a  <br>00:21:51.730 right arrow. Cool, thatshould be all we need.  <br>00:21:54.100 And it'll change thefrequency cuz like I said,  <br>00:21:55.900 it's gonna take 12 hours to findthis. We don't want it to do that.  <br>00:21:59.110 So up here we have frequency that CIScheck is executed by default every 12  <br>00:22:03.280 hours. 43, 200.  <br>00:22:05.200 Let's change that from thatto 60. So every, every minute.  <br>00:22:10.060 Actually let's do 30 seconds. Let'sbe quick. So I'll save this file.  <br>00:22:14.290 I'll restart my service. My was aservice to once some more restart.  <br>00:22:17.410 Service name was a Got it go. Cool.  <br>00:22:19.570 So getting back to our WASA dashboardhere in our integrity monitoring section  <br>00:22:22.870 for our Windows machine.  <br>00:22:24.130 I'm gonna go over here to inventory andjust see if it finds that new registry  <br>00:22:26.800 key. I'll go to registry, I'll searchfor, what do we name it Bernard?  <br>00:22:31.660 Nothing yet. Way for it to findit. There it is right there.  <br>00:22:34.510 So it found the key. It's lookingat it, it's monitoring it. Cool.  <br>00:22:37.660 Now let's go to events. Now you seethat we've got some registry changes,  <br>00:22:40.600 mainly time and we're getting thatbecause we were setting it to every 30  <br>00:22:43.420 seconds. Notice nothing about aregistry key here. Let's go change it.  <br>00:22:46.210 Let's go modify it. Hammer Bernard, hack.  <br>00:22:47.805 Well I'll change the valueto something else. Fun  <br>00:22:52.930 or you got hacked. Cool, let's changeit there. It'll take about 30 seconds.  <br>00:22:57.280 Take a little coffee break andlet's monitor our was the dashboard.  <br>00:23:00.610 I'll refresh it a few times. And ohthere it is. Register key modified.  <br>00:23:04.540 How killer is that? Now you may bewondering, okay, big deal Chuck,  <br>00:23:07.870 I'll barely even know there.But when does registry is,  <br>00:23:09.615 why do I care if it'schanged? And first of all,  <br>00:23:11.260 the registry like has these settingsfor the configuration of your operating  <br>00:23:14.620 system. So if things are changedhere, it's changing everywhere else.  <br>00:23:17.860 Some common things you might seechanged, especially with malware.  <br>00:23:20.530 Is this key here? Does it seem MicrosoftWindows? Where's it at? Where's it at?  <br>00:23:25.450 Windows Current version. There'sa lot of keys in here man.  <br>00:23:28.480 And we have run and runonce these keys are changed,  <br>00:23:31.630 when you add like a new startupapplication for your system.  <br>00:23:33.910 So what malware will do is I'll go inhere and add a new key new string value.  <br>00:23:37.810 Call this, I'll call this bad stuff andI'll just say internet explorer .  <br>00:23:42.705 Let's, let's copy that location.Okay? And looking back at Waza,  <br>00:23:46.580 it does monitor that by default. Andhere in the events, if I refresh it,  <br>00:23:50.180 there it is. Registerkey added and modified.  <br>00:23:53.090 There's the name of it right there. Badstuff. That's pretty powerful, right?  <br>00:23:56.600 The next thing I wanna show you actions.They're so powerful. Check this out.  <br>00:24:00.530 Let's go to our agents here and I'lljump into my Linux machine here.  <br>00:24:04.070 Circs Network, Chuck. Now let's go tosecurity events and I'll jump to events.  <br>00:24:07.730 Now there'll be a lot of eventshere because this machine's public.  <br>00:24:10.010 Now I'm getting things like attemptto log in using a non-existent user.  <br>00:24:13.430 Getting Bruteforce from Russia usingthe user name Pie . That's funny.  <br>00:24:18.230 Anyways, we can do something with that.And actually I wanna try it myself.  <br>00:24:21.800 I'm gonna try in brute force,  <br>00:24:23.030 I'm gonna launch my Callie Linux machinehere and I'll use hydro to brute force  <br>00:24:26.270 the login and I'll use theusername, uh, Bernard Hack.  <br>00:24:29.185 Well and we'll see ifit sees us. Ready, set,  <br>00:24:32.150 go after a pseudo password. Herewe go. Okay, it's attacking.  <br>00:24:36.530 We should see a log. Let's go look atthe logs here. Security events. Events.  <br>00:24:40.760 This happened just now. Let'ssee if it was us. Use your name.  <br>00:24:44.330 Bernard Hack Wall. So there,there we are. How cool was that?  <br>00:24:46.910 Let's stop that nonsense. Let's realquick. See if I try to log into it. Okay,  <br>00:24:51.565 so I, I'm getting a passwordprompt so I'm not being blocked.  <br>00:24:53.960 So clearly I can sit here and just tryand try and try again to my heart's  <br>00:24:57.410 content.  <br>00:24:57.950 But what if I had our seam activelyrespond to that and add it to the block  <br>00:25:02.450 list, drop it, add it to the firewall.We can do that. Check it out.  <br>00:25:05.750 It's called active response, whichcan be used for so many things.  <br>00:25:08.480 But I wanna demo this realquick. Now, to change this,  <br>00:25:10.490 we're gonna go to theconfiguration of our was a server.  <br>00:25:13.040 So we're gonna go here to the was a menu,  <br>00:25:14.480 go to management and thenclick on configuration.  <br>00:25:17.150 From here we're gonna go to the topright and click on edit configuration.  <br>00:25:20.420 And we're gonna scroll down a bit untilwe see a section called active response.  <br>00:25:24.170 Actually, you know, why am I tripping?I'm just gonna search for it.  <br>00:25:25.910 Active response. Cool, thereit is. Active response.  <br>00:25:28.670 So scroll down a bit untilI see this right here.  <br>00:25:31.520 It's kinda giving you a formatfor what it should look like.  <br>00:25:33.980 And I'm gonna copy this config fromthe documentation. Thank you Waza.  <br>00:25:37.940 Check it out here. Command is firewall,drop location, the server. It's uh,  <br>00:25:42.355 the rule is executing on and then it'sgonna look at a rule or it's looking for  <br>00:25:45.355 a rule. This rule is whattriggers this firewall drop.  <br>00:25:48.140 Now when we tried to brute force whatrule was triggered? Let's go find out.  <br>00:25:51.620 I'm gonna jump to uh, ouragents. Go back to my circ Circs,  <br>00:25:54.980 go to security Events. Events andlet's see, it was just earlier, right?  <br>00:25:58.675 Like at 33. Yeah. So here's the alert.You can see yes, it was Bernard Hack.  <br>00:26:02.780 Well and there's the alert IDright there. The rule ID 57 10.  <br>00:26:07.130 That's what we want it to alert off of.  <br>00:26:08.780 So let's go back to our configurationthing here and we'll change that rule from  <br>00:26:12.590 57 63 to 57 10 and this willtime it out or add the firewall  <br>00:26:17.360 rule. And the time outhere is 180 seconds.  <br>00:26:19.610 It'll block the attacker for 180seconds. Pretty cool. So let's save that.  <br>00:26:23.540 Click on save, restart our manager. Justgive that a little, little bit of time.  <br>00:26:27.380 Here're starting, please wait,coffee break. Okay, it's restarted.  <br>00:26:31.790 Now what we wanna do nowis go back to our agent,  <br>00:26:33.710 go back to Search network Chuck andwe'll go to security events and go to  <br>00:26:37.760 events. So last thing we saw agentstarted and stopped. Refresh that. Okay,  <br>00:26:41.570 we're here now let's go and tryto brute force it one more time.  <br>00:26:44.100 Actually real quickly, see if we canlog in. So this time I'm gonna use Root.  <br>00:26:46.980 I know a real user on that system.Let's see if it lets me. Okay, so we're,  <br>00:26:50.460 it's allowing us right now. Nowwe don't have to brute force.  <br>00:26:53.070 We can just try to login with Bernard Hack.  <br>00:26:54.630 Well what that should do is trigger.Now it's right now it's 1203.  <br>00:26:57.870 It should trigger that new activerule. Let's go see. Bam. There it is.  <br>00:27:02.190 So 1203 attempt. Attempt to log inwith non-existent user. Bernard Hack.  <br>00:27:06.120 Well immediately the firewall at dropactive response blocks me. So now,  <br>00:27:10.890 right now for 180 secondsanyway, if I even try to log in,  <br>00:27:14.105 even with a real user, Iget nothing. I'm blocked.  <br>00:27:18.570 I can't even ping it., it's kinda crazy.  <br>00:27:21.210 Let's do a continuous ping and see whenit lets me out outta jail here. Oh,  <br>00:27:25.500 we're back. We're back. Okay, so howcool is that? And just so you know,  <br>00:27:28.710 you can do those active responses basedon a variety of rules. It's so custom.  <br>00:27:33.095 That's why this is so powerful.  <br>00:27:34.350 You can even do it off of like a certaincommand was run or a certain log came  <br>00:27:38.670 about in, in the system you can run aa, an active response. It's so crazy.  <br>00:27:43.740 Now two more things I wanna show youreal quick. First is vulnerabilities. Um,  <br>00:27:47.280 right now if I go to my search network,Chuck and I go to Vulnerabilities.  <br>00:27:51.300 Nothing there. Why? Becauseit's not enabled by default.  <br>00:27:54.270 The system does not search for that. Soit's really, really easy to set this up.  <br>00:27:57.750 We'll go to waza management configuration.  <br>00:27:59.940 Just like before we'llgo to edit configuration.  <br>00:28:02.070 And here we're gonna search forvulnerability detector. Right there.  <br>00:28:06.605 It tells us enabled. No,let's change that to yes,  <br>00:28:10.680 we definitely want that. Then we clickon save and restart Manager, confirm now.  <br>00:28:15.000 So once this restarts, noticethe options it has here.  <br>00:28:17.880 It'll run a full scan every six hours.  <br>00:28:19.680 It'll also run on Start when the servicestarts up. So once this finishes,  <br>00:28:24.090 we'll restart our service and Windowsand Linux and see what happens. Okay,  <br>00:28:27.815 cool. It's done there.I'm gonna go to Windows,  <br>00:28:30.030 restart my service here andwe're restart my service here.  <br>00:28:32.550 I restarting was at Agents.Cool. So now at this point,  <br>00:28:35.880 and if we check our agents, I'lljust go to my Windows machine here,  <br>00:28:38.340 go to vulnerabilities. Cool. Soscan's complete, didn't find anything.  <br>00:28:42.210 Now the reason for that is that my Windowsmachine has like no apps installed on  <br>00:28:45.660 it,  <br>00:28:45.750 but just know to enable the vulnerabilityscanning you have to enable it on the  <br>00:28:49.470 system, on the Waza server. But theagents have that configured by default.  <br>00:28:53.250 Now if I go back to my other server thathas all kinds of fun stuff configured,  <br>00:28:57.300 I gotta get logged back in here.Chloe, she has a bad version of vlc,  <br>00:29:00.990 media player, high severity cde.Wow, look at that, dude, this is fun.  <br>00:29:05.520 Gives you all the details ofit. Oh my gosh, it's so cool.  <br>00:29:08.280 But I wouldn't have known that if Ididn't have this on her system and it just  <br>00:29:11.340 tells me automatically.  <br>00:29:12.780 Now speaking of telling you automaticallyyou'll need some sort of alert, right?  <br>00:29:16.740 Waza has that. They've gotemail alerts and Slack alerts.  <br>00:29:19.380 I'm gonna show you Slack realquick. How to set that up.  <br>00:29:21.570 The first one I'll do is open on Slackand create a new channel just for waza  <br>00:29:25.170 Waza alerts.  <br>00:29:27.870 Now I'll go out to Slackand create a new app.  <br>00:29:30.990 Now this will not be a tutorialon how Slack apps work.  <br>00:29:33.870 I'll just walk you through the basicsyou need to know about right now.  <br>00:29:35.970 And this goes without sayingyou do need a Slack account.  <br>00:29:39.270 So I'll click on create new appfrom name it was uh, alerts,  <br>00:29:44.080 select my workspace, create the app.  <br>00:29:46.210 And then all I wanna add really isan incoming webhook. Activate it.  <br>00:29:49.300 And then at the bottom I'll clickon add new webhook to workspace.  <br>00:29:52.720 I'll click on new channel WazaAlerts Allow. And that's it.  <br>00:29:56.920 And all I need from this is thiswebhook url. I'll copy that,  <br>00:30:00.250 get back to my Wza dashboard.  <br>00:30:02.440 And I'm gonna go back tothat configuration pagewhere we were at before where  <br>00:30:04.660 we spent a lot of time. Clickon Wza, go to management,  <br>00:30:07.395 and then go to configuration. Same thingas before. Click on edit configuration.  <br>00:30:10.900 And here I'm gonna search forintegrations or just integration.  <br>00:30:15.340 And it looks like I don't have asection for that. I'll just add it here.  <br>00:30:18.130 So I'll just go to the top and just underglobal and I'll paste this config from  <br>00:30:22.330 the documentation.  <br>00:30:23.440 The only thing I'll change hereis pasting my webhook right there,  <br>00:30:26.230 which I need to copyagain, paste it there.  <br>00:30:28.360 And actually there is one more thing Iwanna change just in case you don't wanna  <br>00:30:30.975 be killed with alerts because this default setting will have a bunch of  <br>00:30:35.470 alerts sent to me basedon like all the events.  <br>00:30:37.840 And of course you can change the severitylevel of events that are sent to you  <br>00:30:41.260 or even just specify a specific ruleID you're looking for. So for example,  <br>00:30:46.000 right underneath here I can addrule id. And what do you say we do?  <br>00:30:50.110 57 10. That same rule as earlier that weare doing the action roll off of. Cool.  <br>00:30:54.850 So we have our web hook in place,  <br>00:30:56.260 the url we have our rule to alert offof Save it, save and restart manager.  <br>00:31:00.610 Once that is restarted, we'll doour little test here in a moment.  <br>00:31:03.070 And real quick, look, there'snothing in the uh, waza alerts yet.  <br>00:31:06.250 It's kind of quiet here.Cool, it's restarted.  <br>00:31:08.320 Now let's try and log in withBernard Hack. Well again,  <br>00:31:13.900 that should block us. Andthen over here, BAM was alert.  <br>00:31:18.105 Actually hit my watch too. Was I alert?Look at that invalid user. Bernard Hack.  <br>00:31:22.690 Well, from this IP address, which I'mgonna have Nick or Austin block right now,  <br>00:31:27.610 that's awesome, right? So, okay, this isprobably a long video, I realize that.  <br>00:31:32.020 But waza is a powerful tool that willnot only help you protect your family,  <br>00:31:36.220 your own lab, your business, butit'll teach you a ton about security,  <br>00:31:39.940 about hacking about Blue team and thefact that it's free and open source that I  <br>00:31:43.450 just did all of this, it costs menothing except for the hosting,  <br>00:31:46.900 which you could do it on-prem,it's gonna be free for you.  <br>00:31:48.880 It's just kind of crazy.  <br>00:31:49.750 So I hope you have as much fun with thistool as I have and we'll continue to  <br>00:31:53.020 have fun with. Let me know yourthoughts below. What do you think?  <br>00:31:55.720 Let me know how your was ainstallation, implementation went.  <br>00:31:58.540 I wanna know all about it.Anyways, that's all I have.  <br>00:32:00.520 Thank you for joining me in this video.  <br>00:32:02.260 Thank you for having alittle bit of coffee with me.  <br>00:32:04.000 I'll see you in the next video.|### SUMMARY  <br>Matsuo Bashō presents Wazuh, a free cybersecurity tool for threat detection and system monitoring.  <br>  <br>### IDEAS:  <br>- Wazuh is a free, open-source SIEM tool designed for effective cybersecurity management.  <br>- It provides real-time analysis of security events across various infrastructure components.  <br>- The tool monitors for malicious activities and potential intrusions in systems and networks.  <br>- Wazuh automates incident response to detected threats, improving overall cybersecurity posture.  <br>- It supports both on-premises and cloud environments, making it adaptable for organizations.  <br>- File integrity monitoring detects changes in files and configurations to enhance security.  <br>- Vulnerability detection helps identify weaknesses in systems and provides insights for remediation.  <br>- Wazuh aids compliance with regulatory standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.  <br>- The installation process includes setting up the Wazuh server and agents on endpoints.  <br>- Users can configure alerts to receive notifications via email or integration with Slack.  <br>- The tool's dashboard offers a centralized view of security events and agent statuses.  <br>- Wazuh's capabilities extend to log data analysis from various sources for comprehensive security.  <br>- The system requires adequate hardware resources for optimal performance during deployment.  <br>- It encourages learning about cybersecurity through hands-on experiences with threat detection.  <br>- Active response features enable real-time blocking of threats based on identified vulnerabilities.  <br>- Users can customize configurations to align with organizational security policies and requirements.  <br>- Monitoring registry keys on Windows enhances detection of unauthorized changes or malware.  <br>- The platform provides detailed reports on security compliance and configuration assessments.  <br>- Wazuh can scale based on the number of monitored devices and systems in use.  <br>- Regular updates to Wazuh components are essential for maintaining security effectiveness.  <br>- User engagement with the tool can enhance understanding of cybersecurity practices and protocols.  <br>  <br>### INSIGHTS:  <br>- Free tools like Wazuh democratize access to cybersecurity resources for individuals and organizations.  <br>- Engaging with cybersecurity tools fosters deeper understanding and awareness of potential security threats.  <br>- Active response mechanisms revolutionize how organizations can mitigate threats in real-time.  <br>- Learning through practical application of tools empowers users to enhance their personal cybersecurity skills.  <br>- Compliance with security standards is crucial for maintaining trust and security in digital environments.  <br>- Customizable configurations allow organizations to tailor security measures to specific needs and risks.  <br>- Monitoring tools can serve as educational resources for those entering cybersecurity fields.  <br>- The importance of real-time monitoring cannot be overstated in today’s rapidly evolving threat landscape.  <br>- Integrating alerts with communication tools enhances responsiveness to potential security incidents.  <br>- The collaborative nature of cybersecurity tools promotes shared responsibility for organizational security.  <br>  <br>### QUOTES:  <br>- "This cybersecurity tool is amazing.

(free)  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/DbF96IHOZig](https://www.youtube.com/watch/DbF96IHOZig)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.000 You've gotta see this tool. It's nuts.I can finally monitor all my stuff,  <br>00:00:04.540 all of it websites, DNS servers likeAgar game servers, raspberry pies.  <br>00:00:08.960 My kids don't make controllers.Everything in my home lab,  <br>00:00:11.600 everything in my cloud, I can see ifit's up and running or if it goes down,  <br>00:00:15.630 I finally feel like I know what's goingon and I don't even have to look at it.  <br>00:00:19.400 It'll just tell me Slack, discord,whatever this is uptime kua.  <br>00:00:23.920 A monitoring tool you cannotbelieve is free. And honestly,  <br>00:00:26.800 I would've killed four back in the day.Two reasons. You're going to love this.  <br>00:00:30.140 One, it's free. Two, it's beautiful.Come on, look at all this. And I lied.  <br>00:00:35.040 Three reasons. Three, it'sreally easy to set up.  <br>00:00:37.640 You're gonna host it yourself and by thetime you're done, you'll be like, wait,  <br>00:00:40.400 that was it. Not kidding. Five minutes.Get your stinking coffee ready.  <br>00:00:43.800 Let's do this. Now first you gottadecide where are you going to put uptime?  <br>00:00:47.640 Kuma, you got two choices. One the cloud.And number two, inside your home lab.  <br>00:00:51.800 Your home network.  <br>00:00:52.440 Now inside is cool because you caneasily monitor all your home lab stuff  <br>00:00:55.560 without even thinking about it. You don'thave to poke holes in that firewall.  <br>00:00:57.980 And you'll need somewhere to host Uptime,Kua, some kind of Linux based server,  <br>00:01:01.320 like a Raspberry Pie, a spare laptopor an enterprise grade server.  <br>00:01:04.239 But once you got a place to put it,  <br>00:01:05.560 installing is stupid easy cuz we'regonna use Docker. And Docker is amazing.  <br>00:01:08.880 It would be like that coffee breakthat's, that's how long it'll take Arrow,  <br>00:01:12.760 Chuck. Now the cloud is cooltoo. You put it up there,  <br>00:01:15.620 you don't really need anything.  <br>00:01:16.920 You can set it up right now as you'rewatching this video and just kind of play  <br>00:01:19.520 with it, just like see if it's cool.  <br>00:01:21.040 And if you use one of my favorite cloudproviders and the sponsor of this video  <br>00:01:24.130 LE Node, it'll cost you almostnothing like 0.08 cents an hour.  <br>00:01:28.170 Or if you're new to Le Node,  <br>00:01:29.240 it'll be free because they giveyou $100 credit for 60 days. I,  <br>00:01:33.360 that's just do it.  <br>00:01:35.450 So put it in the cloud and you canmonitor everything on the interwebs.  <br>00:01:38.520 You just might have a bit of a problemmonitoring your home lab stuff. Now me,  <br>00:01:41.790 I do both. I've got uptime,  <br>00:01:43.280 coma sitting right next to me in myhome lab monitoring all the things.  <br>00:01:46.080 But I also have one in thecloud redundancy also, I,  <br>00:01:48.560 I monitor my home network to see ifit stays up. Whatever you choose,  <br>00:01:51.160 it doesn't matter. I'm gonna show youboth and it's, it's pretty stink and easy.  <br>00:01:54.000 I'll start with the cloud because ittakes like three seconds and you can't go  <br>00:01:56.640 wrong with LE node. I got a link below.Head over to le [node.com/network](http://node.com/network). Chuck,  <br>00:02:00.440 again, if you're new, you'llget a $100 credit for 60 days.  <br>00:02:03.680 And once you're signed in,click on create the node.  <br>00:02:06.820 Now why this will be so fast isbecause they have a marketplace.  <br>00:02:09.520 Go and click on that and it's gonnabe like, where is it? abcV, oh,  <br>00:02:13.800 uptime Kuma right there. Just selectit, scroll down a bit, put in some info.  <br>00:02:17.520 Email address, limitedpseudo user info, password.  <br>00:02:20.740 You can skip over the DNS stuffif you don't want to use it,  <br>00:02:23.280 I'm not gonna use it rightnow. Select your region,  <br>00:02:25.190 I'll be in Dallas close to me. Andthen pick the size of your LE node,  <br>00:02:28.720 your server. I'm gonna doshared CPU nano one gigabyte,  <br>00:02:31.360 which is five bucks a month or0.01 cents an hour. So seriously,  <br>00:02:35.040 if you wanna try this out, justspin this up, play it for an hour,  <br>00:02:37.800 then delete it and you're charged thatmuch like that's it. Then label it.  <br>00:02:42.200 And dude, that's it.  <br>00:02:43.240 Click on create and take a little coffeebreak cuz you just set up a monitoring  <br>00:02:47.040 service that's gonna take a fewminutes to get baked and ready.  <br>00:02:49.480 So while it's baking,  <br>00:02:50.200 let me show you how to do the on-premsetup in the home lab. So for on-prem,  <br>00:02:54.320 I'm gonna get connectedto my on-prem server.  <br>00:02:56.480 We're gonna launch CMDon Windows Terminal.  <br>00:02:58.800 On Mac and Linux, SSH andSumi server. And I'm in.  <br>00:03:02.160 Now this install will depend on twothings, Docker and Docker compose.  <br>00:03:05.640 Let's make sure we havethose installed right now.  <br>00:03:07.440 Pseudo apt install docker.iodash y. I'm already good.  <br>00:03:11.880 Yours might take a minute. Justtake a little coffee break. Next.  <br>00:03:14.000 Docker compose. Pseudo a PT.Install Docker dash compos dash y.  <br>00:03:18.720 Now that was the hard part. Now watchDucker compose. Just do its thing.  <br>00:03:22.000 You ready? The first thing we'lldo is make a new directory, MK dir.  <br>00:03:25.230 I'll call it Makua. And thenwe'll CD into that CD Makua.  <br>00:03:29.460 And then we'll create one file.  <br>00:03:30.800 I'm gonna use Nano cause Nano is thebest fight me. Come on. Just kidding.  <br>00:03:35.220 But really I lost mytrade of thought. Nano.  <br>00:03:37.400 We'll call this dockerdash compose dot y ml.  <br>00:03:41.060 And here we're just gonna copyand paste. I got some code below.  <br>00:03:43.960 I'm gonna grab mine. I believe thisis the official stuff from Lewis Lamb,  <br>00:03:47.320 the creator of Uptime Kuma. Thatdude's amazing. Thank you Lewis.  <br>00:03:51.830 I love your tool. Now real quick,  <br>00:03:53.360 here's all we're doing withthe Docker composed file.  <br>00:03:55.200 First we're pulling the officialcontainer image from Lewis Lamb for uptime  <br>00:03:58.400 Kuma. Then we're naming itUptime Kuma. And then right here,  <br>00:04:00.960 this is very important.  <br>00:04:01.840 We're mapping a volume to make sure thatour uptime coma data is persistent even  <br>00:04:06.400 if we tear down that containerand build it back up.  <br>00:04:08.280 And then finally we expose some ports.  <br>00:04:10.330 So now that we know what we're doing andwe have a little sip of coffee, right,  <br>00:04:13.400 let's go ahead and hit control X,Y enter to save and check the out.  <br>00:04:18.200 This is all we have to do. Type in docker,  <br>00:04:20.769 compose up dash D. That'sit. You ready? .  <br>00:04:25.820 Now that was faster for me cuz Ialready had the image downloaded.  <br>00:04:28.560 It'll probably download the image for you.  <br>00:04:30.120 It'll be fairly quick And it'srunning If we do a little docker Ps,  <br>00:04:34.640 there he is, he's right there.  <br>00:04:36.090 So now all we have to do is navigate tothe IP address of our container on Port  <br>00:04:40.680 3001. Let's try it out. And here we areready to get set up. Now on LE node,  <br>00:04:45.230 it's even easier if youlook back at your LE node,  <br>00:04:47.920 all you need to do is go to the networksettings under your lin node settings  <br>00:04:52.200 stuff and scroll down just a bit untilyou see the reverse DNS information right  <br>00:04:56.880 here. That's basically a free DNSname you get if you copy that bad boy  <br>00:05:02.020 and paste that into a new tab.Uptime kua, you're ready to go.  <br>00:05:05.800 Now for the remainder of this lab, Iwill continue on my home lab setup.  <br>00:05:08.880 However, it'll be the exact sameas the cloud. So just follow along,  <br>00:05:12.560 get your username and stuff setup. You know how to do this stuff.  <br>00:05:15.400 Password in and click on create mypasswords don't match. Okay, there we go.  <br>00:05:19.980 Now here it is Uptime kua.  <br>00:05:21.720 And what you're gonna love about this ishow simple it is. Like what do you say,  <br>00:05:24.480 we monitor something right now. Let'sdo it right now we have nothing.  <br>00:05:26.720 So we'll click on add a new monitor. Andif you're new to enterprise monitoring,  <br>00:05:30.080 which is just crazy to say that we haveenterprise monitoring and our home lab.  <br>00:05:33.000 Come on guys, if you're new to it, wehave different types. If we look at 'em,  <br>00:05:36.360 there's a lot. And what you'll usedepends on what you need it for right now.  <br>00:05:39.200 What do you say? We monitor [networkchuck.com](http://networkchuck.com/). So we'll choose http,  <br>00:05:42.550 dual friendly name, put in the url.  <br>00:05:44.690 We can change how often we wantto check sixty's too long for me.  <br>00:05:47.800 Let's do like 30 or something better.  <br>00:05:50.080 You can tell it to retry a few moretimes before it considers it down.  <br>00:05:53.000 Zero's fine for me. I want it to be upall the time. Tell me when it's not up.  <br>00:05:56.120 And you got a few more values. Values.Let's jump on down to advanced.  <br>00:05:58.560 And this is pretty cool. Ifyou're monitoring your website,  <br>00:06:00.680 it's good to know if your certificate'sgoing to expire. This will tell you.  <br>00:06:04.240 Click that sucker. Also,  <br>00:06:05.360 if you're monitoring a website insideyour home lab that has a self-signed cert,  <br>00:06:08.640 you can tell it to ignore SSLcertificates, but I don't need that.  <br>00:06:11.840 And then no matter whatmonitor you choose,  <br>00:06:13.240 you'll always have the upside downloadas an option. Which essentially means,  <br>00:06:16.440 hey, is your service down? Then it'sup. Often you probably won't need it,  <br>00:06:19.880 but there are use cases. Now everythingelse you really don't need to change.  <br>00:06:22.800 But I do wanna point outhow powerful this tool is.  <br>00:06:25.260 You can tell it what statuscodes it'll accept as up.  <br>00:06:28.840 Now these are all HTTP status codesand by default it's gonna say, Hey,  <br>00:06:32.080 if we get anything in the 200 range,  <br>00:06:33.520 we're okay because 200 okay isthe best message in the world.  <br>00:06:37.000 That's what happens when you go toa website and it's up and running,  <br>00:06:39.360 you try to pull up a homepagelike network [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/).  <br>00:06:41.560 And if network [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/) is thereand alive and active and working,  <br>00:06:45.080 it'll send back all your good stuff.The homepage along with the 200.  <br>00:06:49.440 Okay message. Anything elsethat we might have a problem.  <br>00:06:51.480 And in case you're curious,  <br>00:06:53.160 anything in the 400 rangeas far as response codes goindicates there's an issue  <br>00:06:57.320 with the client, which is you,the problem's, you, your computer,  <br>00:07:00.400 the way it's trying to receiveinformation. Anything in the 500 range,  <br>00:07:03.880 it's a problem with thesite, it's a server issue,  <br>00:07:05.800 which if you're hosting your ownwebsite, the problem's still you .  <br>00:07:08.520 But yeah, that's what it tells you.  <br>00:07:10.360 Actually that's a nugget you wanna storein your pocket for pretty much anything  <br>00:07:13.200 in it, not just uptime kuma.Remember these things. Now again,  <br>00:07:16.600 most of the time 200 to okay iswhat you want to get. But again,  <br>00:07:19.640 just to kind of touch on the power ofthis thing, if you scroll up a bit more,  <br>00:07:22.680 you can control the http options. Youcan say I want the get post put patch,  <br>00:07:26.800 delete crud, all the stuff. Youcan do that, which is just amazing.  <br>00:07:29.960 But by default this will probablydo what you needed to do.  <br>00:07:32.440 But if you're more advanced youcan go crazy. That's all we need.  <br>00:07:35.240 I'm gonna click on save. And immediatelyit starts monitoring your stuff.  <br>00:07:39.000 Right now it already said,Hey, you're up, Chuck up Chuck.  <br>00:07:42.350 I hate when people say that. Don'tcomment it below, please don't do that.  <br>00:07:45.320 Now do you see how wonderful this is?Not only is it telling us that we're up,  <br>00:07:49.110 it's giving us response times abeautiful graph of response times.  <br>00:07:53.080 How quickly is your websiteresponding? Is it healthy?  <br>00:07:55.440 There's my expirations information.Oh dude, I love this so much, dude,  <br>00:07:59.560 why is my response timeso bad for my website?  <br>00:08:01.640 So you have your first monitorset up. What do you say?  <br>00:08:03.640 We set up another one real quickcause I wanna show you something. Now,  <br>00:08:05.920 website monitoring is cool and thefact that you can do an http monitor is  <br>00:08:09.760 awesome. But did you notice we haveanother option in the monitor? Type.  <br>00:08:12.560 Check this out. We have http withkeyword. What? What does that mean?  <br>00:08:17.170 It means something. Awesome. Let's try,what do you say we monitor network.  <br>00:08:19.880 chuck.coffee. Actually let'stake a coffee break for the url.  <br>00:08:23.000 We'll put in network chuck.coffee.And here's where the keyword comes in.  <br>00:08:26.560 Let's go out there real quick.  <br>00:08:27.320 Let's find a word or a phrasethat comes up when the page loads.  <br>00:08:29.880 Like right here it says start brewing.  <br>00:08:31.280 Let's take that case sensitiveand put it right here.  <br>00:08:33.400 What it will actually do is attempt toload the webpage and it will search for  <br>00:08:38.360 that keyword to make sure you'reactually loading the actual page.  <br>00:08:41.159 And if it loads the keyword, you'reup. If it doesn't, you're down.  <br>00:08:44.350 That's powerful. So I'll change thatto 30 seconds. Click on save and cool,  <br>00:08:48.600 we're up. Now, if I were to change itto something that's not on the site,  <br>00:08:51.360 if I were to edit, if I were to changeit to Ron Swanson and click save,  <br>00:08:55.680 it's gonna say it's down. And noticeit's telling me it's all degraded.  <br>00:08:58.400 It's scary and red. IfI go to my dashboard,  <br>00:09:00.840 which is right up here at the top right,  <br>00:09:02.240 it'll show me what's up and what's down.And notice it even does tell me that,  <br>00:09:05.880 hey, it's 200. Okay, but we couldn'tfind that keyword. So that's, ugh,  <br>00:09:09.520 that's so cool. Now what do you say?We speed around a few more monitors.  <br>00:09:12.440 Things you'll definitely want for yourhome lab or your business or whatever  <br>00:09:15.280 you're doing. Let's click on addnew monitor. Choose our type.  <br>00:09:18.100 Now I want to make sure ad guardis up. So I'm gonna do dns.  <br>00:09:21.000 I'll put in the host name. I want itto resolve, just say network [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/).  <br>00:09:24.190 I'll put in my A guard server as theresolver 4 53. That's what I'm using.  <br>00:09:28.340 And just change some heartbeat intervals.And that's it. Click on save. Wait,  <br>00:09:32.280 why is this thing refused make look what happened? Um, oh,  <br>00:09:35.880 why did I go to port51? Did I change that?  <br>00:09:37.760 I guess I must have you done my scrollthing. All right. Okay, we're up.  <br>00:09:41.240 That scare me for a second.Live troubleshooting. Andlook how cool this is.  <br>00:09:44.520 If you jump into thatmonitor for agar here,  <br>00:09:46.120 it will show me the resultsit's receiving. That's supercool. Now ping monitor,  <br>00:09:49.520 it's pretty straightforward. It'sgoing to send an ICMP message. Hey,  <br>00:09:52.880 are you awake? And itresponds, yes I am. If it is,  <br>00:09:55.680 you can pretty much monitoranything with that one.  <br>00:09:57.760 But this one right here ispretty powerful. The TCP port,  <br>00:10:00.360 you can specify a specific TCPport to monitor. So for example,  <br>00:10:04.040 I've got a Plex server in mynetwork, I wanna see if it's up.  <br>00:10:06.600 That's my host name. And PL bydefault, beyond port 32,400,  <br>00:10:11.240 check the every 30 seconds saveand bam. I know if Plex is up now,  <br>00:10:15.440 if I were to go in there and just stopthe service, we'll see what happens.  <br>00:10:18.000 Stopping it now it is stoppedand boom, it's down. It tells me,  <br>00:10:22.320 and I love that. Now let's get it backup. Boom. Okay, we're back up. Whew.  <br>00:10:25.810 So I think you got the monitoringpart right? It'll monitor your stuff,  <br>00:10:28.200 it'll tell you when stuff isdown or up. It's beautiful.  <br>00:10:30.520 But is it actually telling you,  <br>00:10:31.640 cuz you're not gonna sit here andlook at your dashboard all day,  <br>00:10:33.960 although you could, it'sawesome. It's mesmerizing.  <br>00:10:36.220 But you wanted to tell you when you'reout and about a quick discord or Slack  <br>00:10:39.520 message, telegram. It'll do allthose things. What do you say?  <br>00:10:42.040 We set up Slack right [now.So](http://now.so/) up here at the top, right,  <br>00:10:44.120 we'll go to your name kind of thingup there and click on settings.  <br>00:10:48.200 Well actually while I'm here you canchange all kinds of stuff like appearance,  <br>00:10:51.230 dark mode. You always wannabe in dark mode. You just do.  <br>00:10:53.680 You can set up a reverse proxy, notgonna cover that here, but maybe later.  <br>00:10:56.880 And then a nice added feature thathe didn't have to do but he did.  <br>00:10:59.760 Under security, you can set up twofactor what? I love that. But anyways,  <br>00:11:04.080 what we care about rightnow is notifications.  <br>00:11:05.600 Click on notifications and let's setup one click on set up notification.  <br>00:11:09.100 Let me show you all the options youhave. It's stupid. Look at this. What?  <br>00:11:12.990 Pretty much everything. Now again, whatI care about right now is not email.  <br>00:11:17.040 You can do email though. That'spretty cool. Uh, slack, I'll name it.  <br>00:11:20.200 And then here we'll need a web hook url,  <br>00:11:22.240 which is the URL that Uptime Kuma willuse to send a message to saying, Hey,  <br>00:11:26.400 your pluck servers down,we'll send it to that url.  <br>00:11:28.720 Slack will take it from there. A web hookis actually pretty similar to an api.  <br>00:11:31.960 It's just sitting there open, ready togo waiting to receive a message from you.  <br>00:11:35.280 Now for Slack to do this, you'llneed to set up an application.  <br>00:11:38.000 I'm not gonna cover the details of that,but they have a linked right down here.  <br>00:11:40.960 Click on that. Set up an app realquick. I'll start from scratch.  <br>00:11:44.200 I'm gonna add an incomingweb hook, turn it on,  <br>00:11:46.820 add a new web hook to the workspace.I'll choose the general channel for now.  <br>00:11:50.360 And then right here is that web hookurl. URL generator for me. I'll make it,  <br>00:11:53.000 make it a bit bigger to seeright here. I'm gonna copy that,  <br>00:11:55.920 paste that into my web hook url. Also, Igotta make sure I install that app. Oh,  <br>00:11:59.990 I already did. Okay, we're good. I'llput a username. Just call it uptime Kuma.  <br>00:12:03.400 You can do an icon emoji. I'll dothe fire one. Everything's on fire.  <br>00:12:06.770 Is emojipedia down. Theyneed some uptime coma.  <br>00:12:09.270 I don't need channel name because theweb hook is already setting that up for  <br>00:12:12.160 me. And that's pretty much it.  <br>00:12:14.020 I'm gonna test it real quick sincesuccessfully make I Slack. Yep,  <br>00:12:17.800 slack alert testing right there.  <br>00:12:19.200 And what's cool is I can apply this toall existing monitors and make it default  <br>00:12:22.200 enabled. Click on safe, good to go. Sonow if I were to stop plex again, ah,  <br>00:12:26.320 there it goes. Plex is down and there'smy Slack message. Bam, there it is.  <br>00:12:31.200 That's cool, right? Like that's sopowerful. How easy was that to do?  <br>00:12:34.790 I can't tell you how lucky we are rightnow in this day and age to have this  <br>00:12:38.480 setting up monitoring has never beeneasier and it was so hard back in the day.  <br>00:12:41.920 Not at the risk of making thisvideo way too long. .  <br>00:12:44.280 There is one more thing I wanna showyou cuz this thing's action Pat. Dude,  <br>00:12:47.880 come on. My video editor hates, hates memaking my videos too long. Eat it Nick.  <br>00:12:51.080 I don't care. Up here we havea thing called status pages.  <br>00:12:55.050 Oh I love this app is socool. They click on that.  <br>00:12:57.600 I can create a status page that I canmake available to anybody so people can  <br>00:13:01.760 monitor and tell me if my things are up.  <br>00:13:03.280 I can set it up as a dashboardon my TV or an iPad or something.  <br>00:13:06.520 So I click on ad new status page.I can name it, give it a url,  <br>00:13:10.120 slug and it up chuck, click on next.  <br>00:13:12.580 And then you just kind of make itlook pretty. You can add monitors,  <br>00:13:16.160 I'll add my network check website andyou can add all your stuff and click on  <br>00:13:20.000 save. And there it is a reallybeautiful, I mean it's kind of beautiful.  <br>00:13:23.130 We gotta make a dark mode. Ugh, therewe go. Now it's beautiful status page.  <br>00:13:27.320 You can go up here and say, we have anincident. Yo stuff is down. We know.  <br>00:13:31.810 So people can see stuff is down and theyknow that. You know, powerful stuff.  <br>00:13:34.960 Again, a tool I cannotbelieve is free and a tool.  <br>00:13:38.400 I can't believe you're notalready using. Are you using it?  <br>00:13:40.320 Like you should have gone throughthis and set it up with me.  <br>00:13:42.000 Have you not done thatyet? Do it right now.  <br>00:13:43.400 Thank you for spending time with me toset up some uptime. Kua is your stuff up?  <br>00:13:46.400 I don't know. Coffee. Bye.

<br>00:02:22.000 heart let's get to the  <br>00:02:23.920 [Music]  <br>00:02:26.480 conversation Dr  <br>00:02:28.440 Michael what is the mission that you  <br>00:02:31.280 find yourself on in this phase of your  <br>00:02:34.319 life for those who would  <br>00:02:36.760 like to get everyone who would like in  <br>00:02:40.680 as good of shape as possible with as  <br>00:02:44.720 minimum of a Time investment injury  <br>00:02:48.239 probability and inconvenience in in  <br>00:02:52.239 general as possible and the highest  <br>00:02:54.000 likelihood of best results while trying  <br>00:02:56.480 to completely excise doing anything that  <br>00:02:59.440 is pointless and also I say this  <br>00:03:03.200 politely telling people things that  <br>00:03:06.280 aren't true we're trying to get as many  <br>00:03:08.680 people fit leaner more muscular more  <br>00:03:11.280 flexible healthier Etc as humanly  <br>00:03:14.560 possible to the extent that they are  <br>00:03:16.640 interested in that sort of thing because  <br>00:03:17.840 not everyone's into fitness and I  <br>00:03:19.159 understand that I mean I think I look  <br>00:03:20.799 kind of you know freaky and it scares  <br>00:03:22.519 certain people so I have a lot of time  <br>00:03:24.080 for that but if you want to get fit uh  <br>00:03:26.319 we're trying our best what are the the  <br>00:03:29.080 big myths that end up standing in the  <br>00:03:30.840 way of most people when they when they  <br>00:03:32.760 hear this conversation now what are the  <br>00:03:36.120 most frequent rebuttal that you'll get  <br>00:03:38.439 when you say that someone can get in  <br>00:03:39.879 shape and be be lean with limited time  <br>00:03:44.040 two super common ones  <br>00:03:46.360 are I don't have the time to work out  <br>00:03:50.319 and into that time to work out is  <br>00:03:52.599 included I don't have regular gym access  <br>00:03:55.040 or I technically do but I'd have to  <br>00:03:57.200 drive to the gym I just don't have the  <br>00:03:58.840 time of the bandwidth where I don't have  <br>00:04:00.280 the scheduling positioning in in my life  <br>00:04:02.400 to do this sort of thing and baked into  <br>00:04:05.519 that is the assumption that getting much  <br>00:04:08.000 healthier and much leaner and much more  <br>00:04:09.720 muscular takes like an inordinate amount  <br>00:04:11.720 of time one of the most common questions  <br>00:04:13.519 I get out in the real world when people  <br>00:04:15.599 happen to look in my general direction  <br>00:04:17.079 because usually people just kind of go  <br>00:04:18.358 like what the hell is wrong that guy's  <br>00:04:19.639 head but uh one of the most common  <br>00:04:22.120 questions I get is how many uh hours a  <br>00:04:25.120 day do you work out or how many days a  <br>00:04:26.800 week do you work out and every single  <br>00:04:28.560 person is expecting an answer that is  <br>00:04:31.160 kind of like asking the tallest  <br>00:04:33.080 basketball player you've ever met how  <br>00:04:34.520 tall they are you want an answer that's  <br>00:04:36.080 like 2 and a half meters you want  <br>00:04:38.080 something meaty and if they tell you  <br>00:04:39.600 like well I'm a meter 90 you're kind of  <br>00:04:41.479 like is that that cool and every time I  <br>00:04:44.120 tell them how much I work out which is  <br>00:04:45.680 really like it at my real like trying to  <br>00:04:49.160 be as good as bodybuilding as possible  <br>00:04:51.039 is really eight hours a week and this is  <br>00:04:53.919 to do this insane thing for people just  <br>00:04:57.400 trying to be fit and healthy Etc where  <br>00:04:59.880 talking about a sum total of 1 hour per  <br>00:05:02.800 week split into two or three 20ish  <br>00:05:06.280 minute sessions something we'll be  <br>00:05:07.520 trying later on is such a huge stimulus  <br>00:05:12.280 and can radically transform your body  <br>00:05:14.360 especially if you have attention to  <br>00:05:15.960 nutrition and that's the second thing  <br>00:05:17.800 that's a big Dogma big myth is people  <br>00:05:20.800 have ideas about what comes into  <br>00:05:24.720 nutrition and nutrition for being more  <br>00:05:27.639 lean more muscular and healthier they  <br>00:05:30.000 have all these kind of a constellation  <br>00:05:31.759 of ideas um uh Economist and philosopher  <br>00:05:34.840 Thomas soell calls them Notions so if  <br>00:05:36.759 you have a hierarchy of understanding  <br>00:05:38.919 you have Theory at the top which is like  <br>00:05:41.160 gravitation Evolution things super super  <br>00:05:43.199 confirmed just beneath that you have  <br>00:05:44.880 model like uh the standard model in  <br>00:05:46.840 physics is not quite good enough quite  <br>00:05:48.560 good enough support be a theory but it's  <br>00:05:50.120 very well understood space with a few  <br>00:05:51.680 Mysteries under that you have a  <br>00:05:53.880 hypothesis which is you know you have a  <br>00:05:56.160 real good idea formally phrased and  <br>00:05:58.479 underneath that you have a notion and an  <br>00:06:00.240 oce's just things people say and people  <br>00:06:02.400 are like uhhuh and no one even asks or  <br>00:06:04.800 answers about is this really true and so  <br>00:06:06.960 when you talk to people about nutrition  <br>00:06:08.240 or they talk to you about why they're  <br>00:06:10.160 not in such great shape another thing I  <br>00:06:12.000 get is when you're pretty jacked and  <br>00:06:13.560 lean and you sit next to someone on a  <br>00:06:15.000 plane they treat you almost like a  <br>00:06:16.759 religious figure like a priest or an  <br>00:06:18.120 imom and they're like apologize they're  <br>00:06:20.400 like Co you look like you're in good  <br>00:06:21.759 shape I just haven't been to the gym and  <br>00:06:23.000 I'm like I love you as a human being no  <br>00:06:25.039 matter all the time really all the time  <br>00:06:27.039 they apologize for the state they're in  <br>00:06:28.479 more or less yeah or they see me eat a  <br>00:06:29.960 protein bar and they're getting like the  <br>00:06:31.160 food on the plane and they're like this  <br>00:06:32.639 is bad for me huh and I'm like no it's  <br>00:06:34.080 actually quite fine and I always a  <br>00:06:35.319 little bit confused so all these ideas  <br>00:06:38.280 people have about nutrition organic  <br>00:06:41.280 artificial sweeteners are bad  <br>00:06:43.720 glutenfree GMOs um you have to have very  <br>00:06:47.520 meticulously well-prepared meals there  <br>00:06:49.840 is a ton of food that's huge laundr list  <br>00:06:52.240 of food that's unhealthy and bad for you  <br>00:06:53.800 makes you fat there are other foods that  <br>00:06:55.560 are a little bit more nuanced and  <br>00:06:56.840 difficult to find that are super Health  <br>00:06:58.120 Foods and'll radically transform you I  <br>00:06:59.879 can go on for hours about these myths  <br>00:07:01.759 but people come in with these myths as  <br>00:07:03.840 Notions as things they believe that  <br>00:07:05.479 they're like this is how it is right and  <br>00:07:07.400 when you tell them like actually that's  <br>00:07:09.000 not true a lot of them are  <br>00:07:11.240 like no way because maybe that's the  <br>00:07:13.639 first time they've heard about it so you  <br>00:07:14.960 tell people working out doesn't have to  <br>00:07:17.440 last forever if you do it intelligently  <br>00:07:19.840 which is what we specialize at RP about  <br>00:07:21.400 teaching people how to do and  <br>00:07:22.440 demonstrating digital  <br>00:07:24.000 products you can get into really really  <br>00:07:26.199 good shape with not so much time  <br>00:07:27.960 investment and it's not so difficult  <br>00:07:29.800 it's difficult in the moment as far as  <br>00:07:31.080 you got to try hard but you know an hour  <br>00:07:33.400 of trying hard a week is not the end of  <br>00:07:34.879 the world and then a nutritional front  <br>00:07:36.759 they come in and they think it takes all  <br>00:07:39.039 these crazy special things like people  <br>00:07:41.560 will watch me eat regular food and  <br>00:07:43.160 they'll be like you eat that I'm like  <br>00:07:45.400 yes like but I thought that you know but  <br>00:07:48.039 you need the super special food I like  <br>00:07:49.639 that's never been true but um people  <br>00:07:53.199 come in with their stack of ideas and  <br>00:07:57.319 these there's just dozens and dozens and  <br>00:07:59.520 myths on both ends we'll go through all  <br>00:08:01.400 of those myths but but my last question  <br>00:08:04.080 before we get into it is why does it  <br>00:08:06.520 matter to be in good shape and this is I  <br>00:08:09.639 I'm asking you here to really draw on  <br>00:08:11.280 some of the case studies that you've  <br>00:08:13.039 probably been exposed to where people  <br>00:08:15.000 have turned their lives around what is  <br>00:08:16.879 the net benefit of someone who's  <br>00:08:18.159 listening right now who's maybe heard  <br>00:08:19.479 about Fitness stuff before and has heard  <br>00:08:21.560 from personal trainers and bodybuilders  <br>00:08:23.400 and whoever else but for whatever reason  <br>00:08:25.199 they just haven't been able to get up  <br>00:08:26.680 off the sofa and get into action it's  <br>00:08:28.400 difficult you know what is why should  <br>00:08:30.520 they why should they C I love that  <br>00:08:32.519 question the first thing I'll say is um  <br>00:08:37.240 is maybe not a surprise to many of the  <br>00:08:39.240 people that know me politically I'm like  <br>00:08:41.799 super pro freedom freedom of all kinds  <br>00:08:44.279 inclusion and that means to me also that  <br>00:08:47.279 if someone doesn't want to pursue  <br>00:08:48.880 Fitness as a human being you have the  <br>00:08:51.160 same love and respect at least for me  <br>00:08:53.120 that anyone who's fit would have and so  <br>00:08:55.800 as far as like it'll just make you a  <br>00:08:57.640 better person and you you got to get fit  <br>00:08:59.640 people will see uh people that are obese  <br>00:09:02.120 and they're like look lazy and uh how do  <br>00:09:04.120 they live with themselves I don't ever  <br>00:09:06.160 think things like that not because I'm a  <br>00:09:08.079 good person I'm not a good person at all  <br>00:09:09.959 but what Fitness won't give you is it  <br>00:09:12.760 won't elevate your status as a better  <br>00:09:15.160 person in some way however the other  <br>00:09:19.839 benefits of Fitness we could have a  <br>00:09:22.720 10-hour podcast where I just go through  <br>00:09:24.640 them one one at a time and we would  <br>00:09:26.120 never get through all of them I'll give  <br>00:09:27.320 you a couple of samplings of kind of the  <br>00:09:28.680 big hitters  <br>00:09:30.600 one is Health straight up so if you  <br>00:09:34.320 reduce your body fat substantially and  <br>00:09:36.160 you increase your muscularity  <br>00:09:37.360 substantially and you adopt a lifestyle  <br>00:09:39.600 of moderate to moderately High physical  <br>00:09:43.000 activity quite  <br>00:09:45.120 regularly this is about as close in real  <br>00:09:47.240 life as we have so far to a Panacea a  <br>00:09:49.120 cure all it isn't cure all but the  <br>00:09:51.760 degree of  <br>00:09:54.000 preventative uh you won't get really  <br>00:09:56.240 sick very soon effect that has is just  <br>00:10:00.440 radical I uh just coming off of them but  <br>00:10:04.360 if it's okay to say it was recently on  <br>00:10:06.279 like a boatload of steroids like the  <br>00:10:08.920 worst ones got blood work right in the  <br>00:10:11.760 middle of that because I was very lean  <br>00:10:14.200 and very physically active and muscular  <br>00:10:16.120 my blood Works Stellar just being leaner  <br>00:10:18.880 and more muscular and more active just  <br>00:10:21.240 cleans your blood work up like  <br>00:10:23.560 crazyy and makes your longterm it  <br>00:10:27.040 increases your longevity considerably  <br>00:10:29.320 but it does something I think is pretty  <br>00:10:30.920 close to equally important it  <br>00:10:33.200 increases the kind of time you're having  <br>00:10:35.480 in your life while you're alive uh it  <br>00:10:38.680 makes it way better it reduces the  <br>00:10:40.680 morbidity and so because you can be  <br>00:10:42.600 around a long time living in an assisted  <br>00:10:44.720 care facility and like on machines to  <br>00:10:46.800 keep you that's you're alive sure but  <br>00:10:49.120 there something missing there but if you  <br>00:10:51.079 have more muscle less fat and more  <br>00:10:53.079 physical activity you ever see like an  <br>00:10:55.079 80-year-old that's like cardio walking  <br>00:10:56.680 down the street and you're like my man  <br>00:10:58.880 it'll you that so that's a big deal so  <br>00:11:01.440 Health it'll give you usually people  <br>00:11:04.279 experience a perception of Wellness  <br>00:11:06.160 that's psychological they just feel  <br>00:11:08.760 better they feel cleaner they feel more  <br>00:11:11.880 energy the cognitive benefits of health  <br>00:11:14.399 and fitness are now being addressed  <br>00:11:16.000 seriously in the literature and they  <br>00:11:17.240 have been for a little while but it's  <br>00:11:18.360 kind of  <br>00:11:19.519 swelling uh is unequivocally true now to  <br>00:11:22.360 say that regularly engaging in Fitness  <br>00:11:24.959 makes you literally smarter just  <br>00:11:27.480 straight up and it conserves your  <br>00:11:31.000 brain's cognitive health for decades  <br>00:11:34.600 into the future as you do it  <br>00:11:36.279 consistently it's just win all the way  <br>00:11:38.480 across what is your background in terms  <br>00:11:42.519 of your academic qualifications and  <br>00:11:45.279 experiences that you've had that feed  <br>00:11:47.360 into everything that you know this is  <br>00:11:49.360 sounds so pretentious I can't believe  <br>00:11:50.880 I'm using this nomenclature but I did my  <br>00:11:53.120 undergraduate work at the University of  <br>00:11:56.040 Michigan where I met uh my fellow  <br>00:11:58.800 co-founder of RP Nick Shaw and um that  <br>00:12:03.040 was in kinesiology uh specifically a  <br>00:12:05.639 subset of something called movement  <br>00:12:07.079 science I then went on to do a master's  <br>00:12:10.279 in technically strength and conditioning  <br>00:12:12.120 but exercise science at appalachin State  <br>00:12:14.560 University then I went for one year to  <br>00:12:17.079 go work in New York City with Nick as a  <br>00:12:19.160 personal trainer at the end of that  <br>00:12:21.519 process I realized that for my own  <br>00:12:23.600 personal like Vibe I just didn't know  <br>00:12:25.680 enough and I wanted to know more and so  <br>00:12:28.880 I got accepted to a PhD program at East  <br>00:12:30.800 Tennessee State University under the  <br>00:12:32.160 great Mike Stone who is probably one of  <br>00:12:34.880 the most well-published sports  <br>00:12:35.959 scientists of all time maybe definitely  <br>00:12:38.399 the conversation for the greatest  <br>00:12:39.519 American Sports scientist of all time  <br>00:12:42.079 and I went to that PhD program and that  <br>00:12:44.760 was in sport physiology and the best way  <br>00:12:46.600 we had of summarizing what it is we were  <br>00:12:48.399 learning is the thing we're learning  <br>00:12:50.240 best here is how to take good athletes  <br>00:12:52.040 and make them better and so I did three  <br>00:12:54.240 years of that it sounds like a it's like  <br>00:12:55.639 a prison time I did three years in  <br>00:12:57.600 ETSU and uh that was the conclusion I  <br>00:13:01.279 was a terminal degree I got a PhD in  <br>00:13:02.839 sport physiology and then I spent oh gez  <br>00:13:05.720 10 years in various uh professorships uh  <br>00:13:08.720 teaching and doing some research and all  <br>00:13:10.959 this other stuff I'm no longer a college  <br>00:13:13.040 professor mostly because like there's  <br>00:13:15.760 only so many things you can do at the  <br>00:13:17.240 same time well and it was kind of like  <br>00:13:19.440 this is this YouTube thing is getting  <br>00:13:20.880 kind of insane so time to Pivot to that  <br>00:13:23.320 but uh I'm still actively involved in  <br>00:13:25.360 research our company funds research I  <br>00:13:26.959 still look at manuscripts I still  <br>00:13:28.199 co-author so I'm still involved in that  <br>00:13:29.800 capacity as well so I want to start with  <br>00:13:31.519 a start if someone's listening to this  <br>00:13:33.720 right now and they have walked into your  <br>00:13:36.440 this is your uh this is your practice  <br>00:13:38.839 this is your hypertrophy practice let's  <br>00:13:40.440 say this table and they sit there and  <br>00:13:42.720 they say I would like to gain more lean  <br>00:13:45.800 muscle mass and I'd like to lose some  <br>00:13:48.519 weight um I live A busy life where do we  <br>00:13:52.120 start what step one and you know like  <br>00:13:54.839 I'm actually going to Hazard a guess at  <br>00:13:56.040 step one to see if I'm correct but for  <br>00:13:58.480 me step one is quite psychological  <br>00:14:00.920 because it's all well and good me having  <br>00:14:02.199 the tactics and strategies and the  <br>00:14:03.800 information but if I don't have the  <br>00:14:05.639 motivation none of it's going to matter  <br>00:14:08.079 anyway so is step one psychological in  <br>00:14:11.560 some way absolutely my God you should  <br>00:14:14.079 just be taking my job with this point no  <br>00:14:15.519 but okay I thought so I thought that was  <br>00:14:17.160 so what what would you do for me to get  <br>00:14:19.079 me in the right psychological  <br>00:14:21.480 mindset I would even take a step back  <br>00:14:23.600 before that okay the first thing we do  <br>00:14:26.920 is called the needs analysis and formal  <br>00:14:29.399 Sport Science a needs analysis is what  <br>00:14:33.519 do you  <br>00:14:34.600 want specifically do you want bigger  <br>00:14:37.720 arms how much muscle are you trying to  <br>00:14:40.079 gain it's a very different conversation  <br>00:14:41.560 of someone weighs 150 pounds and they're  <br>00:14:44.040 like I want to be 155 but leaner versus  <br>00:14:47.040 I weigh 150 pounds and I want to be 200  <br>00:14:49.920 ripped different timelines different  <br>00:14:52.000 approaches different trade-offs okay  <br>00:14:53.440 give me the  <br>00:14:54.399 typical answer to that question most  <br>00:14:57.360 people just open-ended to be completely  <br>00:14:58.839 honest honest you're like I just want to  <br>00:15:00.279 get much leaner and some of them will  <br>00:15:02.320 say I also want to put on a lot of  <br>00:15:03.720 muscle the muscle thing is a lot of  <br>00:15:06.040 times with females they just want the  <br>00:15:07.519 leaner part but they understand in many  <br>00:15:10.000 cases that if they just jettison their  <br>00:15:12.600 muscle entirely they end up looking more  <br>00:15:14.399 sick than healthy uh but a lot of the  <br>00:15:16.800 males leaner is important but also  <br>00:15:18.920 getting super jacked is important but  <br>00:15:20.920 how jacked and how lean that's the  <br>00:15:23.120 conversation is if they come in with  <br>00:15:24.880 totally open-ended concerns it's kind of  <br>00:15:26.399 like walking into a car dealership and  <br>00:15:27.600 being like I want a car like you going  <br>00:15:28.720 to have to be a little I we'll sell you  <br>00:15:30.120 whatever you're going to have to tell me  <br>00:15:31.680 a little bit more about what your use  <br>00:15:32.959 cases are about what your budget is so  <br>00:15:35.240 that's another big thing in a need  <br>00:15:36.399 analysis is how much time can you give  <br>00:15:40.000 to this because if someone says I want  <br>00:15:43.040 to eventually be a professional  <br>00:15:45.120 bodybuilder and I've got nothing but  <br>00:15:47.480 time in my week to do the thing think  <br>00:15:49.880 getting a very different plan than  <br>00:15:51.199 someone that's like I just want to be  <br>00:15:53.839 able to see my man down there again and  <br>00:15:57.959 like just not die soon and I have two  <br>00:16:02.120 hours a week to give you very different  <br>00:16:04.880 plan so I've got let's say I've got a  <br>00:16:07.319 couple of hours a week so you know two  <br>00:16:09.319 three hours a week that I could probably  <br>00:16:11.519 spare maybe four and I just want to get  <br>00:16:14.040 a bit leaner and I want to gain some  <br>00:16:15.360 muscle yeah I also ask what have you  <br>00:16:19.240 been doing so far tell me about your  <br>00:16:21.680 approach to Fitness and the answer could  <br>00:16:23.160 be I don't have one I've never tried to  <br>00:16:25.680 do anything once we get a lot of that  <br>00:16:27.920 information I don't want to say the plan  <br>00:16:29.839 writes itself but sort of almost now we  <br>00:16:33.120 really really really have all the  <br>00:16:35.560 details to fill in the blanks and then  <br>00:16:38.279 from there once you've done that sort of  <br>00:16:39.360 needs analysis and you've understood the  <br>00:16:40.759 investment that they're willing to make  <br>00:16:42.199 you understand what their goals are you  <br>00:16:44.240 understand their current approach to  <br>00:16:45.440 Fitness what becomes step two so if  <br>00:16:48.680 again I'm trying to embody the viewer  <br>00:16:50.000 here who's trying to change their life  <br>00:16:51.600 yeah yeah get going for step two often  <br>00:16:53.600 times uh just to keep it SCH we can I we  <br>00:16:56.079 definitely do nutrition uh if you'd like  <br>00:16:57.800 so please C me in for that but I'll just  <br>00:16:59.360 use um training as a quick example here  <br>00:17:02.480 uh a big one is do you go to a gym can  <br>00:17:07.400 you make it to a gym or are you going to  <br>00:17:09.160 be training at home because training at  <br>00:17:11.880 home is a bit of a different world you  <br>00:17:13.559 can get amazing results at home but we  <br>00:17:15.599 need to make sure you have the right  <br>00:17:16.760 equipment and it's super minimal two 20  <br>00:17:19.839 lb dumbbells I like that you're looking  <br>00:17:21.760 over at the dumbbells like are those 20  <br>00:17:23.919 kg dumbbells they're 20 pound dumbbells  <br>00:17:26.280 is that what I need at home for many  <br>00:17:28.240 people 20 like adult males white spry  <br>00:17:31.039 like yourself 20 pound dumbbells at home  <br>00:17:33.440 will give you phenomenal overall result  <br>00:17:37.039 yeah what is that nine kgs or something  <br>00:17:40.120 oh here we go your assistance are quite  <br>00:17:42.919 strong by the way thank do you fight  <br>00:17:44.760 crime in your spare  <br>00:17:47.480 time okay so these are 20 pound  <br>00:17:50.840 dumbbells You're just showing off now  <br>00:17:52.840 but but these are what I need at home to  <br>00:17:54.799 to do a workout uh yeah somewhere  <br>00:17:56.799 between 10 and 20 pounds 10 for small  <br>00:17:58.840 smaller lighter females 20 for larger  <br>00:18:01.799 more strong males somewhere between that  <br>00:18:04.480 two of those dumbbells at home and a  <br>00:18:06.799 little bit of floor space can be the  <br>00:18:08.480 beginning of an absolutely revolutionary  <br>00:18:10.400 workout program really yeah oh yeah how  <br>00:18:13.960 so give me the starting position and the  <br>00:18:16.960 end position that I could get to just  <br>00:18:19.559 with these dumbbells at home if you  <br>00:18:22.600 properly control your diet and you  <br>00:18:24.880 haven't really lifted weights before and  <br>00:18:27.039 you're let's say 30 40 50 years old in a  <br>00:18:30.440 6month time span we can reliably get you  <br>00:18:34.000 to gain 5 to 10 lounds of muscle which  <br>00:18:37.400 if you go to the store what is that like  <br>00:18:39.600 five let's say the two to five kilos of  <br>00:18:42.559 muscle you ever buy two to five kilos of  <br>00:18:44.880 meat at the store that's a lot of meat  <br>00:18:47.240 that's going on your body and we can  <br>00:18:49.720 reliably get you to lose oh gee five to  <br>00:18:54.799 7 and 1 12 kilos of fat in a six-month  <br>00:18:57.400 time frame just by being intelligent  <br>00:18:59.720 about your diet and doing two workouts  <br>00:19:03.120 per week at home with your dumbbells and  <br>00:19:05.840 the workouts each take roughly 20  <br>00:19:08.760 minutes so that's 40 minutes a week oh  <br>00:19:12.440 yeah now that's if you're unaccustomed  <br>00:19:14.039 and unadjusted if you have already and  <br>00:19:16.159 that's why those intake questions are  <br>00:19:17.400 important because if you're like look I  <br>00:19:18.720 go to the gym six times a week I spend  <br>00:19:20.120 two hours at the gym like them dumbbells  <br>00:19:22.320 can keep you in pretty good shape but  <br>00:19:24.480 they're not going to elevate your shape  <br>00:19:25.679 very likely at very least it'll be  <br>00:19:27.640 highly inefficient and incredibly  <br>00:19:29.200 discomforting for what you'd have to do  <br>00:19:30.679 with such  <br>00:19:31.760 dumbbells so what is step three then so  <br>00:19:34.080 if we've got the equipment part figured  <br>00:19:35.640 out and I guess the complicated element  <br>00:19:37.520 of that is some people have anxiety as  <br>00:19:40.240 it relates to going to the gym I've got  <br>00:19:41.480 a lot of friends that because they're so  <br>00:19:44.039 inexperienced with weightlifting or the  <br>00:19:45.799 machines they feel embarrassed to go to  <br>00:19:48.240 the gym so that well at least that's  <br>00:19:50.720 what they tell me now I don't know  <br>00:19:51.880 whether they're Beering themselves but  <br>00:19:53.679 they tell me that they have gym anxiety  <br>00:19:56.000 you know you walk and I no actually I  <br>00:19:57.320 can relate you walk into a gym  <br>00:19:58.679 especially if I go to like a uh like a  <br>00:20:00.320 bodybuilding gym and I do look around I  <br>00:20:02.480 go okay everyone here knows what they're  <br>00:20:03.640 doing more than I do o that's already  <br>00:20:05.720 wrong but we'll get to that a bit and  <br>00:20:07.240 are they looking at me are they do they  <br>00:20:08.919 know that I I don't know how this  <br>00:20:10.280 machine works and if I don't know how a  <br>00:20:11.919 machine works and there's nothing you  <br>00:20:13.720 know No Label to tell me sometimes I  <br>00:20:15.360 just avoid the machine if I'm in in like  <br>00:20:16.919 a bodybuilding gym because I [ __ ]  <br>00:20:18.600 hell I don't know how to do my wrist  <br>00:20:20.880 muscles yeah I just look like a doofus  <br>00:20:23.480 and everyone's making fun of me in their  <br>00:20:24.720 head what I think sometimes if I go to  <br>00:20:26.080 like a really Elite Gym so yeah so first  <br>00:20:28.880 of all I think people's gym anxiety is  <br>00:20:30.799 absolutely real thing I can speak to  <br>00:20:32.240 that at at length The Next Step would be  <br>00:20:35.799 to say Hey listen based on all the  <br>00:20:38.559 information we've collected on your  <br>00:20:39.880 limitations desires abilities we've  <br>00:20:43.120 cultivated a plan for you be diet plan  <br>00:20:45.559 and just just stick into the muscle  <br>00:20:47.080 growth  <br>00:20:48.200 stuff here's your plan for your  <br>00:20:52.760 training and we actually have an app for  <br>00:20:55.640 this sort of thing where we would say  <br>00:20:57.840 okay here's how you you type in all your  <br>00:20:59.320 stuff in the app the app will create a  <br>00:21:01.120 plan for you and it'll tell you here's  <br>00:21:03.919 what to do for warming up here's you  <br>00:21:05.960 know you pick a weight it tells you how  <br>00:21:07.159 to pick your weights and then it  <br>00:21:08.440 programs the rest of your two months of  <br>00:21:10.880 training for you you fill in the how do  <br>00:21:12.799 we how do I feel how am I recovering  <br>00:21:14.279 it'll take care of everything else and  <br>00:21:16.720 if you ever get confused you click on  <br>00:21:18.600 the exercise and it opens up a video  <br>00:21:20.840 with an audio demonstration of how to do  <br>00:21:23.880 it and of someone a professional  <br>00:21:25.960 bodybuilder doing the thing you go oh  <br>00:21:28.120 that's that's what bicep curls was okay  <br>00:21:29.880 got it so now you have all the answers  <br>00:21:31.880 and you don't have to have our app we  <br>00:21:34.039 think it's nice you don't have to have  <br>00:21:35.320 it just whatever kind of plan you have  <br>00:21:38.200 that's your little map of the Caribbean  <br>00:21:40.080 Sea with the AIS and the pirate ships  <br>00:21:42.240 and you know exactly where to go and  <br>00:21:44.240 it's you your app or your map of how to  <br>00:21:47.320 train your program and everyone else  <br>00:21:50.440 like in The Avengers movie it's just  <br>00:21:53.279 just floats away there's no one else  <br>00:21:54.960 there's not even any other machines it's  <br>00:21:56.559 you and the bicep curl machine  <br>00:21:59.159 and the hypertrophy app says first set  <br>00:22:01.440 is 12 reps at 50 pounds I take the  <br>00:22:03.360 select Dr stack I go to 50 and I'm nice  <br>00:22:05.559 and warmed up and I do 12 reps and  <br>00:22:07.799 that's as far as you have to think about  <br>00:22:09.120 it comparisons whatever everyone else  <br>00:22:10.679 thinks without a plan oh boy are you  <br>00:22:13.120 second guessing yourself with a plan you  <br>00:22:15.320 don't have to second guess anything most  <br>00:22:16.520 those people don't have a plan they're  <br>00:22:17.440 just in there on Vibes I feel like my  <br>00:22:19.000 delts are going to grow today if I do  <br>00:22:20.320 this like thanks thanks for that  <br>00:22:22.039 intellectual opinion you said there's  <br>00:22:24.000 two types of effective training one of  <br>00:22:27.039 them's H H can't say this but one of  <br>00:22:29.240 them is hypertrophy very good and the  <br>00:22:31.600 other one is  <br>00:22:33.760 periodization uh so periodization is the  <br>00:22:37.480 scientifically based organization of any  <br>00:22:39.880 kind of training that you want okay  <br>00:22:41.919 hypertrophy training is a type of  <br>00:22:43.679 training it's just muscle growth  <br>00:22:44.880 training it's like a fancy [ __ ]  <br>00:22:46.880 science word for just getting more  <br>00:22:49.440 jacked putting on muscle that's the  <br>00:22:51.919 technical definition of hypertrophy and  <br>00:22:54.360 when you train for hypertrophy you can  <br>00:22:56.080 do it kind of like by feel and more or  <br>00:22:57.880 less at random and you'll get pretty  <br>00:22:59.120 good results in most cases but to get  <br>00:23:00.960 your best results you want that training  <br>00:23:02.320 to be periodized periodization is the  <br>00:23:05.760 scientific approach to how to organize  <br>00:23:07.559 your training to get sort of roughly  <br>00:23:09.640 three things some of these are a bit  <br>00:23:11.240 more for athletes and not regular people  <br>00:23:13.919 get the best results that you can Peak  <br>00:23:16.679 at an appropriate time abs for summer  <br>00:23:19.520 and minimize injury risk and taking all  <br>00:23:22.400 the science that we know that plan that  <br>00:23:24.559 you've made because you did in an  <br>00:23:26.559 evidence-based fashion that is now what  <br>00:23:28.760 is considered a periodized plan so  <br>00:23:31.039 that's how those two concepts relate to  <br>00:23:32.960 each other what do I need to know about  <br>00:23:35.000 hypertrophy in order to be able to  <br>00:23:36.960 achieve it is there anything really  <br>00:23:38.440 foundational because I think everyone  <br>00:23:40.840 wants a bit of muscle growth and I spend  <br>00:23:42.880 I think I spend too long in the gym I  <br>00:23:44.159 think I could be much more efficient um  <br>00:23:46.360 when I'm training what would you  <br>00:23:48.480 recommend that I start thinking about as  <br>00:23:50.720 F foundational principles when it comes  <br>00:23:52.799 to hypertrophy muscle growth one is  <br>00:23:56.320 specificity it's the most important  <br>00:23:58.440 principle in all of sport painting and  <br>00:24:00.440 exercise science is uh what am I here  <br>00:24:03.919 for what do I want because you can do a  <br>00:24:06.919 bunch of exercises in the gym and you're  <br>00:24:09.159 like that was great and someone's like  <br>00:24:10.720 are you getting the results you like  <br>00:24:11.679 you're like well I what I want is a  <br>00:24:13.120 bigger bicep like how many bicep  <br>00:24:14.720 exercises do you do like I think upright  <br>00:24:16.720 rows maybe so I want a bigger bicep  <br>00:24:18.840 bicep if we just focus on me give  <br>00:24:20.440 getting Steven B a bigger left bicep so  <br>00:24:24.760 specificity is telling yourself okay I  <br>00:24:26.279 want bigger biceps and whatever XYZ  <br>00:24:28.399 other  <br>00:24:29.200 muscles then we move in to the principle  <br>00:24:32.399 of overload which means you have to  <br>00:24:35.120 challenge  <br>00:24:36.440 yourself if most of your  <br>00:24:39.559 sets someone else watching them can't  <br>00:24:42.080 tell if you're warming up or doing  <br>00:24:43.600 what's called a working set like a real  <br>00:24:45.159 set you have a problem so towards the  <br>00:24:48.039 end of all of your sets either the  <br>00:24:50.360 weights are slowing down or even if it's  <br>00:24:53.720 the same speed to you they feel  <br>00:24:55.480 perceptively harder you know you do this  <br>00:24:57.960 this this and in a couple reps you're  <br>00:25:00.720 like that's what you want every real  <br>00:25:03.600 working set should be challenging you  <br>00:25:05.720 should be work approaching every real  <br>00:25:07.320 set with just a teeny teeny dose of  <br>00:25:09.600 trepidation like oh boy here we go I'm  <br>00:25:13.000 GNA have to  <br>00:25:14.279 try once you have that and a set is a a  <br>00:25:18.080 group of repetitions correct so if I do  <br>00:25:20.720 10 repetitions that's one set one set  <br>00:25:22.799 yeah and so your sets have to be  <br>00:25:25.399 sufficiently heavy uh anything between  <br>00:25:28.320 between roughly five reps per set and 30  <br>00:25:31.200 reps per set where the last few reps are  <br>00:25:33.440 getting close to you not being able to  <br>00:25:34.919 use good technique and lift the weights  <br>00:25:37.279 check plus so there's not a set a  <br>00:25:39.640 perfect amount of repetitions to do  <br>00:25:41.840 there is it's a trade secret and I'd  <br>00:25:43.279 have to say it off camera to you like ND  <br>00:25:45.600 assign okay we're off camera all right  <br>00:25:47.080 great so it's  <br>00:25:48.480 17 um there is so there's just tons of  <br>00:25:51.880 tons of contextual Nuance kind of stuff  <br>00:25:54.720 some people some of their muscles will  <br>00:25:56.600 seem respond better to sets a five to 10  <br>00:25:59.279 other folks even the same person could  <br>00:26:01.159 have muscles in their body that really  <br>00:26:02.360 respond better to sets of 20 to 30 and  <br>00:26:04.840 everything in between but generally you  <br>00:26:06.039 get in in the exercise science data  <br>00:26:09.039 you'll have a group of people training  <br>00:26:10.919 for sets of roughly five reps and  <br>00:26:13.360 another group training for sets of  <br>00:26:14.760 roughly 30 reps and their change in  <br>00:26:17.039 muscle growth over 8 12 16 weeks is  <br>00:26:19.480 statistically undifferenced  <br>00:26:28.600 that's so crazy using the same weight  <br>00:26:30.760 I'm guessing different weight a weight  <br>00:26:32.840 that is challenging for five reps is  <br>00:26:34.279 much heavier than a weight that is  <br>00:26:35.320 challenging for 30 okay so I do Wonder  <br>00:26:37.200 this all the time when I go to the gym I  <br>00:26:38.279 wonder if I should be doing I don't know  <br>00:26:40.320 30 reps of 10 kg on my bicep or I should  <br>00:26:42.960 be doing 10 reps of 20 kg they're both  <br>00:26:46.360 right answers no wrong answers there and  <br>00:26:48.120 they both have the same chance of  <br>00:26:50.559 growing my muscles as long as the strain  <br>00:26:53.120 that I experience subjectively is  <br>00:26:55.799 difficult at the end of those set  <br>00:26:57.080 correct okay interesting which is really  <br>00:26:59.120 good news because that's like another  <br>00:27:00.360 thing you don't have to worry about  <br>00:27:01.760 which means at home I can get any range  <br>00:27:03.159 of Weights versus having to get really  <br>00:27:05.559 really big ones to gr as long as they're  <br>00:27:07.039 not so tiny that you're on rep number 45  <br>00:27:09.120 and you're like I could just do this for  <br>00:27:10.240 forever or they're not so enormous that  <br>00:27:12.240 you're like I can't really even do two  <br>00:27:13.679 reps of this anything between roughly  <br>00:27:15.399 five and roughly 30 reps challenging is  <br>00:27:18.159 really really good how many sets and how  <br>00:27:21.240 often do I have to visit the gym to get  <br>00:27:24.279 this bicep to grow that answer depends  <br>00:27:26.640 on how much you've been doing before  <br>00:27:28.640 okay but if you're new to the gym two  <br>00:27:31.559 sessions a week with two to three sets  <br>00:27:35.440 per session for your biceps is something  <br>00:27:38.640 that's going to cause months and months  <br>00:27:40.200 and months of consistent progress can  <br>00:27:42.559 you do more yes do you have to do as a  <br>00:27:45.760 beginner no eventually as a more  <br>00:27:48.000 advanced person do you need to do more  <br>00:27:50.039 sets and perhaps more sessions to get  <br>00:27:51.679 consistently better results yes but for  <br>00:27:53.919 beginners who haven't been in the gym  <br>00:27:55.200 very much or at all the minimal  <br>00:27:57.320 effective dose is profoundly small which  <br>00:28:00.640 is why I can say things like if you work  <br>00:28:02.039 out for 20 minutes twice a week you're  <br>00:28:03.360 going to get great gains what if I go to  <br>00:28:05.480 the gym and I do six sets on my biceps  <br>00:28:09.120 and I just go to the gym once a week  <br>00:28:10.960 does the distance between the workouts  <br>00:28:13.519 in a muscle group have an impact yes  <br>00:28:16.919 once a week training gives you good  <br>00:28:18.880 results but twice a week training for  <br>00:28:21.240 the same muscle gives you notably better  <br>00:28:24.799 results training three times a week  <br>00:28:27.559 versus twice tce training four times a  <br>00:28:29.840 week versus three times training five  <br>00:28:31.799 times a week versus four times is uh an  <br>00:28:35.279 an exponentially de-escalating amount of  <br>00:28:37.919 impressive differences so one time a  <br>00:28:40.320 week Works it'll get you results two  <br>00:28:43.320 times a week gets you like one and a  <br>00:28:45.120 half times the results like way better  <br>00:28:47.919 better three times a week is like  <br>00:28:50.399 another little bit more results still  <br>00:28:52.320 notable four times a week is like you  <br>00:28:54.519 got to be training for a while to notice  <br>00:28:56.120 the difference between three and four  <br>00:28:58.080 four and five is contextual and nuanced  <br>00:29:00.000 and I can't actually tell you that  <br>00:29:01.320 categorically 5 days a week is better  <br>00:29:03.080 than four there are some things I would  <br>00:29:04.720 have to know about your plan and  <br>00:29:05.799 everything else to make that conclusion  <br>00:29:07.159 so really I want to be aiming at twice a  <br>00:29:08.559 week per muscle group twice is our  <br>00:29:10.279 minimum two to four times a week is what  <br>00:29:11.880 I say is kind of the best overall  <br>00:29:13.480 recommendation per muscle group and if  <br>00:29:15.799 you train all of your muscles together  <br>00:29:17.519 at the same time a whole body workout  <br>00:29:19.039 which most people in the realm of just  <br>00:29:20.880 I'm busy and I can't train a lot it  <br>00:29:22.640 would be all of the major muscles of  <br>00:29:24.519 your body in the same session twice or  <br>00:29:28.440 three times or four times a week and  <br>00:29:30.039 that is an awesome beginner fitness plan  <br>00:29:32.840 what's going on in my muscles that's  <br>00:29:35.519 encouraging them and making them grow  <br>00:29:37.480 and when are they growing is it when I  <br>00:29:38.720 go to bed at night is it when I do they  <br>00:29:40.559 grow the minute that I curl the the  <br>00:29:42.799 dumbbell what's actually going on  <br>00:29:44.640 because sometimes understanding what's  <br>00:29:45.960 actually going on inside helps me to  <br>00:29:47.519 think through and change my behavior  <br>00:29:50.000 yeah so uh the primary stimulus for  <br>00:29:53.600 muscle growth is there are molecular  <br>00:29:56.320 machines in your muscles in your muscle  <br>00:29:58.919 cells and they are designed to detect  <br>00:30:01.960 the presence of  <br>00:30:04.360 tension and when your muscles generate  <br>00:30:06.559 tension the molecular detector machines  <br>00:30:08.559 go o we got tension here and they start  <br>00:30:11.320 uh saying to other parts of the cells  <br>00:30:13.039 like hey uh let's get this muscle growth  <br>00:30:14.679 thing started started not happening  <br>00:30:16.679 started it's a stimulus of muscle growth  <br>00:30:19.080 there are a couple of other mechanisms  <br>00:30:20.600 which might SL probably have an effect  <br>00:30:24.840 and that a couple of them are metabolite  <br>00:30:26.960 sequestration which is a very fancy way  <br>00:30:28.880 of saying the burn you know at the end  <br>00:30:30.559 of a set you're like ah the metabolites  <br>00:30:33.799 the um byproducts of training if they  <br>00:30:36.480 accumulate to high levels it's been  <br>00:30:37.880 shown in tons of animal studies and a  <br>00:30:40.000 few human studies that like  <br>00:30:41.640 mechanistically they might also tell the  <br>00:30:43.399 molecular Machinery that grows muscle  <br>00:30:45.000 for you again later to uh hey get the  <br>00:30:48.240 muscle growth process another one is the  <br>00:30:49.760 pump so you know you do a couple sets of  <br>00:30:51.399 biceps you're oh my God what's going on  <br>00:30:53.320 here baby flash it at some girl she runs  <br>00:30:55.399 away as usual and the actual cell  <br>00:30:58.440 swelling itself might play a causal  <br>00:31:01.399 mechanistic role in generating more  <br>00:31:03.159 muscle growth but but we know it's  <br>00:31:04.960 probably at least at Le least 80% of the  <br>00:31:07.720 muscle growth anyone will see is because  <br>00:31:09.840 of those receptors for tension muscle  <br>00:31:13.320 growth as soon as you leave the gym is a  <br>00:31:16.200 negative because the gym is catabolic  <br>00:31:18.440 it's a breaks down your muscle actually  <br>00:31:21.120 training breaks down more muscle than it  <br>00:31:23.559 builds however as you go home and you  <br>00:31:26.919 start eating food protein carbs fats and  <br>00:31:30.039 you have several meals per day and  <br>00:31:32.399 you're resting when the food's coming in  <br>00:31:35.120 several hours after training begins if  <br>00:31:37.360 you measure muscle growth consistently  <br>00:31:39.000 which is really difficult to do they  <br>00:31:40.320 don't do it super often you have to keep  <br>00:31:41.960 people in a laboratory you have to do  <br>00:31:43.240 radioactive tracers and measure all this  <br>00:31:45.200 weird  <br>00:31:46.200 stuff every couple of hours they measure  <br>00:31:48.720 the amount of muscle growth that's going  <br>00:31:50.399 on in the biceps goes up and up and up  <br>00:31:52.200 and up and it usually Peaks  <br>00:31:53.840 about half a day to a day and a half  <br>00:31:56.880 after you lift depend depending on how  <br>00:31:58.360 hard you went if it's a pretty easy  <br>00:31:59.679 workout it Peaks a little sooner and  <br>00:32:02.440 Dives and drops off about a day or two  <br>00:32:04.480 later if you train really crazy hard  <br>00:32:07.159 it'll Peak like a day day and a half  <br>00:32:08.679 later and then half a week later it'll  <br>00:32:10.399 drop off back to Baseline levels but  <br>00:32:12.559 it's this really smooth curve and you're  <br>00:32:15.880 growing muscle at every single point  <br>00:32:17.559 under that curve So when you say is it  <br>00:32:19.600 while I'm sleeping is it while I'm  <br>00:32:20.679 eating is it while I'm resting the aners  <br>00:32:22.320 all of those except it's not at the gym  <br>00:32:25.200 you don't grow muscle at the gym you  <br>00:32:26.919 give yourself a signal to grow muscle at  <br>00:32:28.480 the gym and then what you do outside of  <br>00:32:30.039 the gym matters so some people train  <br>00:32:31.320 really hard they don't eat right they  <br>00:32:33.159 don't need enough protein their sleep is  <br>00:32:35.080 total insert bad word here and their  <br>00:32:37.799 stress levels are just totally psychotic  <br>00:32:40.320 they train hard and then week after week  <br>00:32:42.440 after week they're like not seeing any  <br>00:32:44.720 results well the results are actually  <br>00:32:46.440 created when you're resting when you're  <br>00:32:48.480 sleeping when you're eating nutritious  <br>00:32:49.960 food they're stimulated in the workout  <br>00:32:52.880 but that's just phase one phase two the  <br>00:32:54.840 actual growth occurs outside the gym and  <br>00:32:56.720 it occurs not in any any specific time  <br>00:32:58.639 Point like a Magic Window of two hours  <br>00:33:01.279 after the gym like that's when all the  <br>00:33:02.480 growth occurs that's actually when it  <br>00:33:03.840 just starts to go up it's four days  <br>00:33:06.480 afterwards so if you train twice a week  <br>00:33:08.559 you train on Monday you're going a lot  <br>00:33:10.039 of muscle on Monday night Tuesday and  <br>00:33:12.080 Wednesday back uh towards the end of  <br>00:33:14.000 Wednesday you're just not really growing  <br>00:33:15.279 much more muscle you go back to the gym  <br>00:33:17.320 Thursday you hit it hard again you hit  <br>00:33:19.320 that curve up by Sunday you're totally  <br>00:33:21.519 relaxed during Sunday you're not growing  <br>00:33:24.159 any muscle your body's really recovering  <br>00:33:26.039 a lot of that fatigue and then by Monday  <br>00:33:28.159 you're fresh as a pickle and you're  <br>00:33:29.360 ready to go at it again how long will it  <br>00:33:31.600 take me to lose the muscles that I've  <br>00:33:33.320 gained if I don't go back to the gym so  <br>00:33:35.200 again focusing on this bicep I train it  <br>00:33:37.600 I do two times a week I get it nice and  <br>00:33:39.559 big how long before it  <br>00:33:42.559 vanishes great question two-part  <br>00:33:45.919 answer part one  <br>00:33:49.159 is within about two weeks of not  <br>00:33:52.039 training  <br>00:33:53.120 it the first reduction in muscle that is  <br>00:33:57.240 detected by Modern Machinery occurs so  <br>00:34:00.679 if you don't lift for 2 weeks and we put  <br>00:34:03.679 you in an MRI scanner or a dexa scanner  <br>00:34:06.279 let's say a week and a half you don't  <br>00:34:07.440 lift I can't tell you're not really  <br>00:34:10.119 losing any muscle yet you're just going  <br>00:34:11.879 insane and so me personally I'm like  <br>00:34:13.839 addicted to lifting so if I don't lift  <br>00:34:15.159 for a week I'm like oh my God oh my God  <br>00:34:16.599 all my muscle's gone there is some kind  <br>00:34:18.760 of intuitive truth to that because when  <br>00:34:21.040 you don't stress your muscles they when  <br>00:34:23.440 you do stress your muscles they get a  <br>00:34:25.280 little bit inflamed and they bulge up a  <br>00:34:27.399 little bit B so when you're not training  <br>00:34:29.440 for half a week to a week your muscles  <br>00:34:32.560 look smaller like they've lost weight  <br>00:34:34.280 but it's really just all water that they  <br>00:34:35.560 lost you do one gym session thinking  <br>00:34:38.399 like oh my God my biceps are gone a week  <br>00:34:40.000 and a half later you do one session at  <br>00:34:42.079 the end of that you flex and you're like  <br>00:34:43.320 oh my God I'm the biggest I've ever been  <br>00:34:45.159 I was just delusional that whole time CU  <br>00:34:47.079 that stuff comes back super quick after  <br>00:34:49.560 about two weeks of not lifting you start  <br>00:34:51.760 to lose muscle but it happens really  <br>00:34:53.839 really slowly and takes weeks and weeks  <br>00:34:55.918 and weeks and weeks after for several  <br>00:34:58.200 months of not lifting you're going to  <br>00:34:59.920 look considerably smaller in your biceps  <br>00:35:02.839 but probably not as small as when you  <br>00:35:04.960 started lifting because your muscles  <br>00:35:06.960 have a certain memory if we can call it  <br>00:35:08.920 that is that true that thing oh yeah and  <br>00:35:12.200 so a lot of times when you gain an  <br>00:35:13.760 initial amount of muscle especially if  <br>00:35:15.280 you've been at it for years it just  <br>00:35:17.359 never goes back to the same size as when  <br>00:35:19.079 you started it's just always going to be  <br>00:35:20.920 bigger until you reach your 80s or  <br>00:35:22.960 something like that that being said yes  <br>00:35:26.599 you will notice reductions size so two  <br>00:35:28.440 weeks is the direct answer there and  <br>00:35:30.599 it's going to take weeks and weeks and  <br>00:35:31.960 months and months to recede however  <br>00:35:33.520 here's part two and this is awesome news  <br>00:35:36.480 because of that muscle memory  <br>00:35:38.720 situation however long it took you to  <br>00:35:41.079 gain the muscles  <br>00:35:42.839 initially it's going to take you an  <br>00:35:45.839 order of magnitude a factor of 10ish or  <br>00:35:48.760 so less time to get it back if you've  <br>00:35:51.960 been more jacked before if you've had  <br>00:35:53.880 bigger muscles they come back to their  <br>00:35:56.680 old size  <br>00:35:58.160 if it took if you you you lifted for  <br>00:36:00.240 eight months you got a bigger bicep and  <br>00:36:03.119 you stopped Lifting for three months and  <br>00:36:04.520 it looks about the same as when you  <br>00:36:06.000 started if you're really careful like  <br>00:36:07.200 okay it's a little bit bigger but really  <br>00:36:08.440 it's just back to square one most people  <br>00:36:10.560 think oh my God another eight months  <br>00:36:13.480 just to get back to where I started like  <br>00:36:15.079 forget the gym the truth is after  <br>00:36:18.000 roughly about a month maybe as little as  <br>00:36:20.599 3 weeks you're going to have the same  <br>00:36:22.240 size biceps that you did in your Peak  <br>00:36:24.400 because the degree to which your tissue  <br>00:36:26.920 grows if it's been a certain size before  <br>00:36:29.079 especially if it was notably bigger than  <br>00:36:31.760 normal and you held that around for a  <br>00:36:33.720 few months and a few years it comes back  <br>00:36:37.160 in a way that is so fast If you  <br>00:36:39.680 experience If you experience it yourself  <br>00:36:42.160 it's it's like you don't believe that  <br>00:36:44.000 it's happening to you you they been able  <br>00:36:46.240 to like scientifically test this oh yeah  <br>00:36:48.319 all the time yeah retraining studies  <br>00:36:49.839 detraining retraining oh yeah they've  <br>00:36:51.680 they've done studies where they  <br>00:36:52.800 purposefully like lift for a while and  <br>00:36:54.560 they stop Lifting for a long time and  <br>00:36:55.920 they see how long it takes to get back  <br>00:36:57.319 and  <br>00:36:58.160 um there's one study I'm familiar with  <br>00:37:00.440 offand that there's a group of people  <br>00:37:02.640 that trained consistently for multiple  <br>00:37:05.119 weeks and there's another group of  <br>00:37:07.400 people that trained consistently for a  <br>00:37:09.319 few weeks and then took two weeks  <br>00:37:11.200 completely off in the middle and then  <br>00:37:12.880 just started retraining again for a few  <br>00:37:14.359 weeks later both groups had identically  <br>00:37:17.680 sized differences in muscle at the end  <br>00:37:19.680 of the study and so we were like okay so  <br>00:37:21.680 so that group that trained consistently  <br>00:37:23.280 never took two weeks off could we say  <br>00:37:25.839 that they purposefully like dunked two  <br>00:37:28.359 weeks of their time away for nothing  <br>00:37:30.599 uhhuh yeah your body goes right back  <br>00:37:33.839 into regaining old lost muscle so  <br>00:37:36.880 rapidly that this is such great news  <br>00:37:39.960 because look let's say you lifted  <br>00:37:41.839 consistently most of the Year holiday  <br>00:37:43.880 season comes up Winter  <br>00:37:45.520 holidays you're not going to the gym as  <br>00:37:47.920 much maybe not at all three weeks later  <br>00:37:50.240 of no gym you look at yourself you look  <br>00:37:52.040 a little small or kind of deflated and  <br>00:37:53.560 you're like oh my God I'm going to have  <br>00:37:55.760 to restart all this from scrap  <br>00:37:58.079 nope two weeks later you're in the best  <br>00:38:00.640 shape of your life again if you left the  <br>00:38:02.720 gym for 6 months one or two months later  <br>00:38:05.680 you're in the best shape of your life  <br>00:38:06.920 again that's how rapidly it comes back  <br>00:38:08.720 so it's really good news for anyone who  <br>00:38:09.960 hasn't been in the gym and is feeling  <br>00:38:11.119 guilty about it go back get consistent  <br>00:38:13.280 again you're just going to Skyrocket  <br>00:38:15.839 that is very exciting because yeah we  <br>00:38:17.880 always have sometimes it's the trough  <br>00:38:19.960 the the couple of weeks off that makes  <br>00:38:21.480 us demotivated cuz that's crossed my  <br>00:38:23.400 mind before Oh my God that took me three  <br>00:38:24.839 months to get there and it's going to  <br>00:38:26.599 take me another 3 months to get back but  <br>00:38:28.920 what about so if I'm training that bicep  <br>00:38:31.240 how have I got to think about stretching  <br>00:38:33.560 and warming up before I start before I  <br>00:38:36.040 get going with my training there are  <br>00:38:38.079 many ways to do it but uh there's some  <br>00:38:41.040 research on this recently  <br>00:38:43.000 actually you don't need much one of the  <br>00:38:46.560 simplest ways to warm up that we  <br>00:38:48.520 recommended RP and our app has it in the  <br>00:38:50.760 in the  <br>00:38:52.280 instructions you want let's say you have  <br>00:38:54.480 your final weight already picked out  <br>00:38:56.640 like last week did 20 lb dumbbells for  <br>00:38:59.680 sets of 15 this week it's sets of 16  <br>00:39:02.240 with the 20 lb dumbbells what you want  <br>00:39:04.359 to do is you want to do very lightweight  <br>00:39:08.680 maybe the 5B dumbbells for a set of 12  <br>00:39:12.079 just to get everything moving and  <br>00:39:13.160 grooving good technique same technique  <br>00:39:14.599 you're going to  <br>00:39:15.640 use 30 seconds of rest a minute of rest  <br>00:39:19.359 you pick up  <br>00:39:21.880 the 10 or 15 PB dumbbells you do a set  <br>00:39:25.000 of eight reps there a little bit more  <br>00:39:26.640 challenging your feel your grooove a  <br>00:39:28.040 little bit but your body is already more  <br>00:39:29.240 warm your nervous system is more active  <br>00:39:30.800 your muscles are more  <br>00:39:32.319 pliable you rest a minute after that and  <br>00:39:36.119 then you'll pick up the weight you're  <br>00:39:37.400 actually using the 20 Pounders and  <br>00:39:39.800 you'll do a set of two to four reps with  <br>00:39:41.599 them just to get the feel of that heavy  <br>00:39:43.520 weight that you're going to be doing to  <br>00:39:44.880 climatize not just your muscles and your  <br>00:39:46.839 nervous system but your psychology to  <br>00:39:48.359 like okay this is this is the business  <br>00:39:49.640 weight that I'm going to be using so 12  <br>00:39:52.560 84 rest another 30 seconds first working  <br>00:39:56.040 set of whatever 6 reps you're up when  <br>00:40:00.079 you have multiple exercises for the same  <br>00:40:01.800 muscle group you just need to do one set  <br>00:40:04.560 of like four to eight reps in that  <br>00:40:07.240 middle weight range between zero and  <br>00:40:09.200 whatever you're going to do just to get  <br>00:40:10.800 the feel of the exercise because you're  <br>00:40:12.079 already generally warm in that area one  <br>00:40:14.520 little warmup set rest uh you know 30  <br>00:40:16.720 seconds to a minute and then hit your  <br>00:40:18.000 first set if you're switching which  <br>00:40:20.319 muscles you're using like you were  <br>00:40:21.520 training chest but then in the same  <br>00:40:22.839 session you started training back that  <br>00:40:24.880 first back exercise 1284 the weight goes  <br>00:40:28.079 up up up the Reps go down down down just  <br>00:40:30.200 a little bit of time between and then  <br>00:40:31.800 you hit your first work set you're good  <br>00:40:32.960 to go you don't have to do cardio before  <br>00:40:35.280 you don't have to get on the treadmill  <br>00:40:36.319 you can if you like it you don't have to  <br>00:40:38.079 do some kind of cardio warm-up you don't  <br>00:40:40.000 have to do any kind of stretching or  <br>00:40:41.280 anything like that you don't have to do  <br>00:40:42.560 any kind of weird bosu ball band around  <br>00:40:44.440 your neck crazy potentiation exercises  <br>00:40:47.119 just that little ramp up is basically  <br>00:40:50.119 98% of all cases exactly and only what  <br>00:40:52.760 you need to do what is a warm-up what is  <br>00:40:55.119 going on physiologically inside my  <br>00:40:56.640 muscle cuz we we all just warm up and I  <br>00:40:58.640 don't think anybody actually knows what  <br>00:41:00.000 what's going on yeah so your muscle  <br>00:41:04.079 tissues um they have uh they have  <br>00:41:08.440 physical qualities that can be measured  <br>00:41:10.200 almost in like a fluid dynamics terms  <br>00:41:12.119 like viscosity and hysteresis and all  <br>00:41:14.560 that stuff and so when you're very cold  <br>00:41:19.920 a lot of times the uh there's kind of a  <br>00:41:23.200 Frailty implied there as you're warming  <br>00:41:26.359 up you're sending blood to around the  <br>00:41:28.920 muscle the muscle itself is literally  <br>00:41:30.920 becoming warmer and a lot of those kind  <br>00:41:34.200 of tight structures that are uh they  <br>00:41:36.800 proteins that are made of kind of a  <br>00:41:38.040 stretchy material they loosen up a  <br>00:41:39.680 little bit and that allows you to go  <br>00:41:43.880 through that full range of motion and  <br>00:41:45.079 training and not actually get hurt and  <br>00:41:48.520 that's from the muscle perspective you  <br>00:41:50.720 also get some kind of chemical stuff  <br>00:41:52.280 that happens and certain structures fill  <br>00:41:53.839 up with chemicals certain structures  <br>00:41:55.480 chemicals go down and that gets you  <br>00:41:56.880 ready to perform super hard work but  <br>00:41:59.960 that's part of the story the other part  <br>00:42:01.160 is the nervous system because your  <br>00:42:03.440 nervous system is also getting warmed up  <br>00:42:05.200 and in technical terms it's called  <br>00:42:07.280 potentiation when you just show up to  <br>00:42:10.359 the gym and you let's say we said look  <br>00:42:13.359 okay we re-engineered your tendons when  <br>00:42:15.000 you were asleep you're not going to get  <br>00:42:16.720 hurt it's impossible for you to get hurt  <br>00:42:18.079 like a car would have to hit you for you  <br>00:42:19.280 to rip your bicep off you can just go  <br>00:42:21.520 and just hit the curls right away you  <br>00:42:23.680 wouldn't get hurt but it would feel  <br>00:42:25.480 really strange and you wouldn't get four  <br>00:42:27.680 or five reps close to where you're  <br>00:42:29.440 supposed to be from last week because  <br>00:42:31.319 your nervous system was like what hell  <br>00:42:33.559 is going on I'm supposed to be doing  <br>00:42:35.359 something so you need warm up the  <br>00:42:36.319 nervous system a part of that is  <br>00:42:38.119 literally like the actual nervous system  <br>00:42:39.800 itself down to the C Level is Flushing  <br>00:42:42.280 all kinds of metabolites through the  <br>00:42:43.680 connections are getting stronger you're  <br>00:42:45.920 uh sort of doing a little bit of kind of  <br>00:42:47.319 mini rewiring of primary motor cortex to  <br>00:42:50.200 say go oh we're doing curls this is how  <br>00:42:52.599 you execute this pattern another part is  <br>00:42:55.119 technical like oh this is the technique  <br>00:42:57.480 I'm going to do because if you just get  <br>00:42:58.960 in the muscle and just do stuff like  <br>00:43:00.920 imagine if I told you like hey here's a  <br>00:43:02.280 ball just like go go shoot some hoops  <br>00:43:04.040 just hit that you know three-pointer  <br>00:43:05.640 shot you're  <br>00:43:06.720 like I need a couple shots to remind my  <br>00:43:09.880 body of what it's like to shoot the  <br>00:43:11.720 basketball same idea for lifting you to  <br>00:43:13.880 remind your body of what a curl motion  <br>00:43:15.640 is and if you remind it a couple sets in  <br>00:43:17.520 a row by the time you hit that real  <br>00:43:19.400 working set that fourth set your body's  <br>00:43:21.559 like I know exactly what I'm going to do  <br>00:43:24.160 which parts of the muscle I'm going to  <br>00:43:26.119 activate to contract which other parts  <br>00:43:28.079 of other muscles am going to activate to  <br>00:43:29.680 relax and co-contract to make this whole  <br>00:43:31.680 thing happen what are the the other sort  <br>00:43:33.800 of common mistakes people make when they  <br>00:43:35.920 they go to the gym or they start  <br>00:43:36.960 training or they start exercising so  <br>00:43:38.839 there I've I've kind of ticked off not  <br>00:43:41.240 stretching and taking on a heavy load  <br>00:43:43.960 too quickly um but also ramping up  <br>00:43:46.920 volumes and loads too fast so that sort  <br>00:43:49.200 of over strained before my body is ready  <br>00:43:50.920 for it are there any really other sort  <br>00:43:52.960 of common obvious mistakes people make  <br>00:43:55.200 that inhibit their progress  <br>00:43:58.240 one of them is a failure to pay  <br>00:44:00.839 attention to good technique okay there  <br>00:44:04.040 are sort of some Universal principles of  <br>00:44:05.880 what is good technique in the gym for  <br>00:44:07.359 muscle  <br>00:44:08.280 growth one of them is are you moving in  <br>00:44:11.720 a way that properly activates stimulates  <br>00:44:14.880 that muscle to actually get it to grow  <br>00:44:17.800 because if you do a curl that arcs up it  <br>00:44:22.040 does a lot of bicep if you do a curl  <br>00:44:24.280 that arcs back this way because the  <br>00:44:26.440 bicep is being pulled one way and pulled  <br>00:44:28.839 the other way at the shoulder and the  <br>00:44:30.720 elbow it ends up doing more of um  <br>00:44:33.480 stabilizing contraction than actually  <br>00:44:35.760 being the prime mover for the movement  <br>00:44:37.960 so when you see people curling at the  <br>00:44:39.240 gym and they're just kind of doing this  <br>00:44:40.400 you're like yes that is training your  <br>00:44:43.119 biceps but if you just moved a little  <br>00:44:45.839 bit differently it would be so so much  <br>00:44:47.400 better here's another example squatting  <br>00:44:49.319 right for your legs if you squat really  <br>00:44:52.760 far back and not so far down like you're  <br>00:44:57.040 your glutes get hit okay your lower back  <br>00:44:59.280 and upper and midback is going to get  <br>00:45:00.920 hit a lot but because there's not a huge  <br>00:45:03.559 change in your knee angle you're not  <br>00:45:06.119 getting a ton of quad stimulus if you  <br>00:45:08.160 stay more upright and your heels and  <br>00:45:10.880 toes are on the ground and you allow  <br>00:45:13.240 your knees to go Way Forward beyond your  <br>00:45:15.880 toes as you stay upright and sink down  <br>00:45:18.520 really low so that your knee goes into  <br>00:45:19.960 one of these oh my God it's all quads  <br>00:45:23.000 all day long so you want technique that  <br>00:45:25.520 is targeting the muscle it's very  <br>00:45:27.720 similar rep to rep to rep and it puts  <br>00:45:30.400 the muscle consistently through a range  <br>00:45:32.720 of motion that is in that deep painful  <br>00:45:35.640 uh length and stretch position if you  <br>00:45:37.760 just have all those three everything  <br>00:45:39.480 else we can say about your Technique is  <br>00:45:41.079 just nuances and finer points those are  <br>00:45:43.079 really the big ones we talked about  <br>00:45:45.000 nutrition earlier as well so if I want  <br>00:45:46.920 to make my bicep grow and also drop off  <br>00:45:50.720 the weight around the bicep so you can  <br>00:45:52.520 see see it even more what should I be  <br>00:45:54.440 putting into my  <br>00:45:55.599 mouth the number one requisite for  <br>00:45:58.160 muscle growth is  <br>00:46:00.160 protein foods with lots of protein in  <br>00:46:04.079 them ideally should be consumed three to  <br>00:46:07.400 five times per day at roughly  <br>00:46:09.640 equidistant intervals breakfast lunch  <br>00:46:12.319 dinner totally fine even better  <br>00:46:14.440 breakfast lunch dinner evening  <br>00:46:17.000 snack the average person  <br>00:46:20.240 needs a little bit less than let's say a  <br>00:46:24.359 gram per pound of body weight per day of  <br>00:46:26.480 protein actually considerably less  <br>00:46:28.559 that's kind of the top limit and a cool  <br>00:46:30.559 aspirational thing to shoot for so if  <br>00:46:33.720 you weigh let's say 200 lb you should be  <br>00:46:37.200 consuming something like 150 to 200  <br>00:46:39.599 grams of protein per day and 150 for  <br>00:46:41.640 almost everyone's totally enough but if  <br>00:46:43.520 you're real serious and hardcore and  <br>00:46:45.119 just want that insurance policy 200  <br>00:46:46.680 grams of protein per day so then if  <br>00:46:48.680 you're eating four times a day that's oh  <br>00:46:51.160 yeah 30 40 let's say 40 to 50 grams of  <br>00:46:55.200 protein per meal can I eat too much  <br>00:46:57.800 protein and and then it becomes fat or  <br>00:47:00.359 something uh that's uh so protein by  <br>00:47:03.319 itself no if your protein is so high  <br>00:47:06.040 that your carbs and fats are the same  <br>00:47:08.160 and you jack up your protein super high  <br>00:47:09.720 but your carbs and fats stay where they  <br>00:47:11.440 are your calories become excessive that  <br>00:47:14.040 will cause fing over time but if you're  <br>00:47:16.119 doing a diet where you take a ton of  <br>00:47:17.640 protein but you dropped your carbs and  <br>00:47:19.119 fats and your calories are at  <br>00:47:20.559 maintenance levels you're not going to  <br>00:47:21.880 gain any fat it's not bad for your  <br>00:47:23.839 kidneys it's not bad for any other part  <br>00:47:25.520 of your body excessive protein as a  <br>00:47:28.559 health malady has been a myth the entire  <br>00:47:31.000 time and that's one of those um Notions  <br>00:47:33.280 that people carry with them that too  <br>00:47:35.000 much protein is bad right like yes if  <br>00:47:36.559 you've had kidney surgery absolutely  <br>00:47:38.359 short of that you're probably good to go  <br>00:47:40.640 you'll fart a lot and people will hate  <br>00:47:42.119 you but you know you mentioned three to  <br>00:47:44.800 five meals a  <br>00:47:46.040 day a lot of people are now in this Camp  <br>00:47:48.760 of of fasting an intermittent fasting  <br>00:47:51.720 and not eating often is it possible to  <br>00:47:53.839 fast but also to gain muscle mass in the  <br>00:47:56.200 way that you've described yeah totally  <br>00:47:58.000 it just won't happen at as an impressive  <br>00:47:59.920 rate so you have to make a trade-off for  <br>00:48:01.599 yourself if you want you know most  <br>00:48:03.839 jacked Steven that you can be three to  <br>00:48:05.720 five meals a day consistently spread in  <br>00:48:07.880 almost to an  <br>00:48:09.839 individual competitive bodybuilders eat  <br>00:48:13.720 that frequently and eat high protein how  <br>00:48:16.160 often did you eat uh I eat five five  <br>00:48:18.599 times a day four or five times a day  <br>00:48:20.079 usually and do you eat before or after  <br>00:48:22.040 you train both okay so before you train  <br>00:48:24.720 and after you train do you different  <br>00:48:26.160 things a times I'll train early in the  <br>00:48:27.920 morning and so I won't train at I won't  <br>00:48:29.640 eat at all I'll wake up and I'll have  <br>00:48:31.559 like a protein and carb mix shake with  <br>00:48:33.400 my training totally optional super extra  <br>00:48:36.079 credit may not do anything at all if you  <br>00:48:38.200 look at the literature but I find it a  <br>00:48:40.000 little bit compelling to do a little bit  <br>00:48:41.240 of that and then afterwards I have my  <br>00:48:43.200 first post-workout meal second meal  <br>00:48:45.119 third meal fourth meal bedtime wake up  <br>00:48:47.040 do it again what you take to get you  <br>00:48:49.280 going do you do pre-workout no why no uh  <br>00:48:51.920 I don't do any stimulants of any kind  <br>00:48:54.040 why uh I'm just kind of coked up all the  <br>00:48:56.960 time naturally so like if you give me  <br>00:48:59.280 stimulants it's just going to go into  <br>00:49:01.040 the not so pleasant side of side effects  <br>00:49:03.319 like I'm just going to be like this and  <br>00:49:04.960 way too amped up super high anxiety and  <br>00:49:07.640 my thoughts get to be like I have less  <br>00:49:09.440 fluidity of thinking and stuff so I just  <br>00:49:11.799 it just a lot of me I guess and so when  <br>00:49:14.079 I wake up in the morning I don't need  <br>00:49:15.520 anything to get me going I just go and a  <br>00:49:17.680 couple warm-up sets later I have all the  <br>00:49:19.319 energy I need that's not everyone and so  <br>00:49:22.559 some green tea some black coffee or some  <br>00:49:24.920 pre-workout 30 minutes before the the  <br>00:49:26.880 gym is great advice for a ton of people  <br>00:49:28.839 I feel like pre-workout can't be healthy  <br>00:49:30.799 if you're doing it five six seven times  <br>00:49:32.799 a week because some of that stuff is so  <br>00:49:34.799 unbelievably strong like I've had it  <br>00:49:36.720 before I've got literally like heart  <br>00:49:37.839 palpitations when I've had a pre-workout  <br>00:49:39.400 and you know you talk about anxiety that  <br>00:49:41.200 anxious feeling it can't be it can't be  <br>00:49:43.640 help healthy for people to be doing that  <br>00:49:46.200 frequently it seems to be quite fine it  <br>00:49:49.079 seems to be quite fine now at the  <br>00:49:50.839 extremes and in for some individuals  <br>00:49:53.440 it's not ideal but um the upper limit  <br>00:49:57.400 dose of caffeine in milligrams per day  <br>00:50:01.520 at which we can confidently say most  <br>00:50:03.400 people will experience the beginnings of  <br>00:50:06.000 Health  <br>00:50:07.000 maladies is a th000  <br>00:50:09.760 milligrams and a cup of coffee has  <br>00:50:12.440 depending on which cup 50 to 100 now  <br>00:50:15.440 some pre-workouts have 250 gr milligrams  <br>00:50:18.799 of caffeine some have  <br>00:50:21.160 500 uh last I checked Ronnie Coleman's  <br>00:50:24.280 pre-workout has 550 migs of caffeine per  <br>00:50:27.720 scoop or per serving and so that's kind  <br>00:50:30.119 of a lot uh I if I took 550 migs of  <br>00:50:33.640 caffeine you don't take me to the gym  <br>00:50:35.720 just take me right to the hospital put  <br>00:50:37.400 me in the psychiatric word 36 hours  <br>00:50:39.440 later I'll be okay but for some people  <br>00:50:41.799 to get so accustomed to high doses of  <br>00:50:43.440 caffeine that is supposed not unhealthy  <br>00:50:45.240 for them to consume and also uh they  <br>00:50:47.760 feel quite fine so I would say start  <br>00:50:49.599 with as little as you need to get you  <br>00:50:51.160 going and if you need to tight trate and  <br>00:50:52.640 work up from there that's a good thing  <br>00:50:54.760 the other thing I would say is I would  <br>00:50:57.200 have a compelling case for pre-workout  <br>00:50:59.559 or stimulant if I ask you like hey how  <br>00:51:02.400 much energy do you typically have at the  <br>00:51:03.640 gym you're like well that's super great  <br>00:51:05.599 and they're like should I take  <br>00:51:06.520 pre-workout I'd be like no there's no  <br>00:51:08.240 compelling case for that at all if  <br>00:51:09.920 you're like look I wake up in the  <br>00:51:10.839 morning some days I just don't get a ton  <br>00:51:12.599 of sleep and I need something to get me  <br>00:51:14.920 going not every day but sometimes I'll  <br>00:51:16.799 be like hey look consider green tea  <br>00:51:19.680 black coffee some diet soda or all the  <br>00:51:22.920 way up to pre-workout if you need it but  <br>00:51:25.440 some people take it kind of a like um a  <br>00:51:28.319 like a religious thing as a habit uh as  <br>00:51:31.160 a ritual and it's like dude you're  <br>00:51:33.240 training your forms and biceps for 20  <br>00:51:36.000 minutes total at 900 p.m. you do not  <br>00:51:38.599 need three scoops of pre-workout for  <br>00:51:40.440 that I don't even know where it's going  <br>00:51:42.000 at that point so some people get a  <br>00:51:43.280 little crazy with the pre-workouts at  <br>00:51:44.839 the end of the world it's at at best  <br>00:51:48.839 needless what's your stance on the whole  <br>00:51:50.960 idea of calories in calories out a lot  <br>00:51:53.359 of people just focus on that as their  <br>00:51:55.520 their sort of their script to lose body  <br>00:51:59.359 weight lose body fat and gain muscle is  <br>00:52:02.640 is that a useful frame to to use and why  <br>00:52:05.839 do so many people fail at it if if it is  <br>00:52:08.319 a useful frame most people fail at it  <br>00:52:11.240 because they don't consider both the  <br>00:52:13.440 calories in and calories outside of the  <br>00:52:16.559 equation and a lot of people fail  <br>00:52:18.920 because they're very bad at estimating  <br>00:52:20.680 food amounts and calories they someone  <br>00:52:23.359 will say like a tablespoon of peanut  <br>00:52:25.000 butter Stephen if you ever actually seen  <br>00:52:27.119 a tablespoon measuring cup it does not  <br>00:52:30.200 look like Mom's tablespoon where she  <br>00:52:32.119 takes the peanut butter and goes that's  <br>00:52:34.640 like four tablespoons and so like but  <br>00:52:36.720 I'm eating the calories blah blah blah  <br>00:52:39.599 every time you take people into what's  <br>00:52:41.319 called a metabolic Ward which is a study  <br>00:52:44.040 center where you're not allowed to have  <br>00:52:45.880 visitors that bring you food the workers  <br>00:52:48.240 only give you the food that you need and  <br>00:52:49.760 all of your exercise and your output is  <br>00:52:51.720 controlled and monitored and so is your  <br>00:52:53.359 intake no one has ever violated laws of  <br>00:52:55.960 thermodynamic we give you a certain  <br>00:52:57.440 number of calories and we expect you to  <br>00:52:58.760 lose a certain number of weight there's  <br>00:52:59.799 a variance about that but it you're  <br>00:53:02.720 going to lose the weight that roughly we  <br>00:53:04.520 predict if we account for all variables  <br>00:53:05.880 you're going to lose almost exactly the  <br>00:53:07.040 weight that we predict so calories in  <br>00:53:08.240 calories out is incontrovertible in  <br>00:53:10.599 among 90s something per 98% of people  <br>00:53:15.000 who do research in the field and are  <br>00:53:16.359 scientifically literate and educated  <br>00:53:18.160 calories in calories out is not  <br>00:53:19.640 controversial it never has been there  <br>00:53:21.559 are some people who say well calorie  <br>00:53:24.400 counting didn't work for me that's  <br>00:53:26.920 probably because you did it wrong or you  <br>00:53:29.000 weren't even concerned about how much  <br>00:53:30.400 protein you're taking in or how many  <br>00:53:31.640 carbs or how many fats there are other  <br>00:53:33.040 details that matter like if you say I  <br>00:53:36.880 need a V8 engine in a car that's all  <br>00:53:38.760 that matters like okay well there's no  <br>00:53:40.240 steering wheel there's no pedals cool  <br>00:53:42.160 well okay I need those things too so  <br>00:53:44.200 calories and calories out is the very  <br>00:53:45.839 core because without an engine you're  <br>00:53:46.920 not going anywhere but what types of  <br>00:53:50.119 foods you're eating matters a little bit  <br>00:53:52.200 are you getting enough protein carbs  <br>00:53:53.480 fats that matters a bit too so people  <br>00:53:55.319 like to just bash calorie balance and  <br>00:53:58.040 calories in calories out is well it's  <br>00:53:59.559 it's totally myth it doesn't work no no  <br>00:54:01.000 it works great it's just not always  <br>00:54:03.400 enough to get you in the best shape you  <br>00:54:04.760 can but if you do it right as far as net  <br>00:54:07.400 balance weight gain or weight loss  <br>00:54:09.720 calories in calories out is actually the  <br>00:54:11.520 only thing that matters tissue wise is  <br>00:54:14.760 that gain mostly muscle or mostly fat is  <br>00:54:17.160 the loss mostly muscle or mostly fat  <br>00:54:19.079 that has not so much to do with calories  <br>00:54:20.760 it has much more to do with proteins  <br>00:54:22.799 carbs fats the quality of food you're  <br>00:54:24.680 eating nutrient timing and all the rest  <br>00:54:26.440 of it so calories and calories out is  <br>00:54:27.680 amazing super explanatory critical but  <br>00:54:30.359 it's just not the whole picture and  <br>00:54:32.319 that's really it I guess because so many  <br>00:54:33.680 people say they've heard about calories  <br>00:54:35.319 and calories out but they fail at  <br>00:54:38.480 maintaining it now that's really about  <br>00:54:40.599 motivation and the psychology of doing  <br>00:54:42.200 such a thing um some people have said to  <br>00:54:44.079 me that our bodies want to defend our  <br>00:54:45.559 weight so if we start eating less we'll  <br>00:54:47.720 become a little bit more hungry if we go  <br>00:54:49.040 for a run after the run or after  <br>00:54:51.119 physical exertion our body will try and  <br>00:54:52.760 make up for it because it's programmed  <br>00:54:54.079 to try and defend its weight because its  <br>00:54:55.960 weight cor relates to our ability to  <br>00:54:58.520 survive  <br>00:55:00.119 um why do people fail at it one of the  <br>00:55:02.680 reasons you said is because you know  <br>00:55:04.160 that they're not actually measuring the  <br>00:55:05.440 calories correctly but the psychological  <br>00:55:07.480 reasons that it isn't hasn't worked for  <br>00:55:10.000 some people can you think of many  <br>00:55:12.359 because when I when people talk about  <br>00:55:13.440 calories in calories out if you look at  <br>00:55:15.000 the comment sections on those videos  <br>00:55:16.240 people say I've tried this and it didn't  <br>00:55:17.319 work okay so first of all I typically  <br>00:55:20.160 don't look at comment sections of videos  <br>00:55:21.760 because comment section is not  <br>00:55:23.520 representative of the population it's  <br>00:55:25.720 not represent reprentative of the people  <br>00:55:27.480 that watch your videos it's not  <br>00:55:28.799 representative of the hardcore  <br>00:55:30.000 demographic that watches your videos so  <br>00:55:32.640 just as a statistical artifact every  <br>00:55:35.000 single Claim by people against calorie  <br>00:55:37.520 balance in that comment section could be  <br>00:55:40.000 true for them but they represent 1% of  <br>00:55:42.599 the population so 99% of people at works  <br>00:55:44.920 just fine for 1% they get into some kind  <br>00:55:47.119 of trouble usually that trouble is they  <br>00:55:49.440 didn't count calories properly they  <br>00:55:51.480 didn't account for macronutrient profile  <br>00:55:53.280 proteins carbs fats they didn't account  <br>00:55:54.680 for nutrient timing or the kinds of food  <br>00:55:56.480 that they're they're doing and so on and  <br>00:55:57.680 so forth and another one is like you  <br>00:56:00.559 said  <br>00:56:01.799 sustainability how long do I have to  <br>00:56:04.200 count calories for in my life for me to  <br>00:56:06.920 get the body that I want and keep it is  <br>00:56:08.799 sure [ __ ] not going to be forever so  <br>00:56:10.520 what I'll do is I'll count calories for  <br>00:56:11.880 a few months I'll lose a lot of weight  <br>00:56:13.400 then I'll go back to eating on Vibes and  <br>00:56:14.960 the weight comes right back absolutely  <br>00:56:17.039 so better than just counting calories  <br>00:56:19.559 what we want to do is instill people  <br>00:56:21.200 with good eating habits if you learn how  <br>00:56:23.400 to construct meals made of lean proteins  <br>00:56:25.760 veggies fruits whole grains healthy fats  <br>00:56:28.200 you know roughly how to see how much  <br>00:56:30.000 food you need and how much food looks at  <br>00:56:32.039 least like it's what you eat per day if  <br>00:56:33.839 you're checking your body weight  <br>00:56:35.000 relatively often and when your body  <br>00:56:37.039 weight starts to get a little higher you  <br>00:56:38.319 kind of clean up your diet a little bit  <br>00:56:40.039 uh and when your body weight's nice and  <br>00:56:41.240 low you couple cheat meals couple kebabs  <br>00:56:43.680 you know burgers and stuff that's all  <br>00:56:45.359 good if you do that and you have those  <br>00:56:46.640 healthy habits whatever weight you lost  <br>00:56:48.400 on calorie restriction you can maintain  <br>00:56:50.920 with very very little work not counting  <br>00:56:53.839 a damn thing just on good habits but but  <br>00:56:56.799 if you counted calories you do some  <br>00:56:58.559 weird diet where you only eat like too  <br>00:57:00.200 with orange slices and protein shakes or  <br>00:57:02.280 something yeah the calorie counting will  <br>00:57:04.319 get you wherever you need to go but then  <br>00:57:06.160 afterwards like the diet's over and  <br>00:57:07.480 you're like now what do I do like uh  <br>00:57:10.200 good luck going out in the world and  <br>00:57:11.799 feating the same diet that got you fat  <br>00:57:13.559 in the first place that's the big kicker  <br>00:57:15.880 people might say it takes too much time  <br>00:57:17.880 to count calories it leads to a an  <br>00:57:20.599 unhealthy relationship with food I think  <br>00:57:22.640 there's a big movement at the moment to  <br>00:57:23.799 trying to get calories off menus because  <br>00:57:25.839 it's said to increase the amount of  <br>00:57:27.799 people that have eating disorders and  <br>00:57:28.920 things like  <br>00:57:30.799 that is that a a conversation worth  <br>00:57:34.799 entertaining in this in this regard sure  <br>00:57:36.839 sure very few people will develop Eating  <br>00:57:40.880 Disorders based on increases in  <br>00:57:43.079 information they are presented I would  <br>00:57:45.559 actually call that eating order instead  <br>00:57:47.039 of eating  <br>00:57:48.400 disorder most people who get Eating  <br>00:57:50.440 Disorders are highly at risk genetically  <br>00:57:53.119 and with a few other social  <br>00:57:55.000 circumstances  <br>00:57:57.280 Eating Disorders are uh for example the  <br>00:58:00.799 most uh deleterious Eating Disorders  <br>00:58:04.039 anorexia  <br>00:58:05.640 nervosa seen not exclusively but almost  <br>00:58:09.559 exclusively in females of reproductive  <br>00:58:12.000 age they ain't calories on a menu doing  <br>00:58:14.839 that that's something you bring into the  <br>00:58:17.359 table usually because you have the  <br>00:58:19.440 genetic proclivity for it and  <br>00:58:21.880 additionally because you've been in a  <br>00:58:24.119 social and cultural circumstance where  <br>00:58:27.079 not only were you the wrong person to  <br>00:58:28.920 get ridiculed for your weight but also a  <br>00:58:31.839 lot of people ridiculed you for your  <br>00:58:33.319 weight and then you go all careening off  <br>00:58:35.839 on this path where no one can even tell  <br>00:58:37.520 you're super skinny anymore because you  <br>00:58:38.760 don't believe it so the idea that uh  <br>00:58:42.200 you're going to see much higher  <br>00:58:43.200 prevalence globally in Eating Disorders  <br>00:58:44.839 from putting menu calorie labels on  <br>00:58:46.680 things is true by this much at the  <br>00:58:49.400 margins and it's just largely not the  <br>00:58:51.839 case adjacent to that is this idea of  <br>00:58:54.160 muscle dysmorphia which affects  <br>00:58:56.599 a lot of people but specifically men  <br>00:58:58.839 roughly 87% of men that are between 15  <br>00:59:01.960 to 32 years old that experience muscle  <br>00:59:05.200 dysmorphia which is what so muscle  <br>00:59:08.920 dysmorphia generally is for whatever  <br>00:59:11.799 level of jacked that you are you think  <br>00:59:14.520 you are considerably less jacked both in  <br>00:59:17.720 reference to yourself and your own  <br>00:59:19.359 desires and in reference to an ethereal  <br>00:59:21.920 make belief comparator population in  <br>00:59:23.920 your head so if you were to ask like hey  <br>00:59:26.920 Mike do you feel jacked and I'm like  <br>00:59:29.559 nope you're like oo not good not a good  <br>00:59:31.720 sign clearly he's jacked and then you  <br>00:59:33.640 can ask me Mike compared to other  <br>00:59:35.440 40-year-old ashkanazi Jewish men how  <br>00:59:38.400 Jacked are you and if I'm like I'm  <br>00:59:40.160 probably like bottom 50% for sure  <br>00:59:42.520 probably bottom 25 to' be like okay he's  <br>00:59:44.480 mentally ill take him away that is high  <br>00:59:46.760 level muscle dysmorphia a disassociation  <br>00:59:49.760 from any objective reality about how  <br>00:59:52.520 much muscle you actually have do people  <br>00:59:55.680 over estimate or underestimate their  <br>00:59:57.599 appearance as it relates to their  <br>00:59:59.039 muscles uh dysmorphia is almost always  <br>01:00:01.920 cataloged as an underestimation but but  <br>01:00:04.760 from your experience working with people  <br>01:00:06.119 do people think they're more jacked than  <br>01:00:07.480 they actually are it really depends on  <br>01:00:09.760 the individual most people that are in  <br>01:00:12.160 gym culture that are very invested if  <br>01:00:15.200 you catch them on their not so great  <br>01:00:16.799 days they think they're substantially  <br>01:00:19.440 less jacked than they really are and if  <br>01:00:21.720 you tease it apart via conversation  <br>01:00:23.880 they'll end up being like yeah no no I  <br>01:00:25.160 know I'm jacked but I'm just saying like  <br>01:00:26.880 and then it's aspirational like for my  <br>01:00:28.920 goals I'm not as jacked as I would like  <br>01:00:31.079 to be it's interesting because we  <br>01:00:32.799 typically think of women I think  <br>01:00:35.319 stereotypically in society as caring  <br>01:00:38.160 more about their body image but I've  <br>01:00:41.880 I've read a lot of stats lately that  <br>01:00:43.079 suggest men care equally about their  <br>01:00:44.920 body image but just in slightly  <br>01:00:46.280 different ways and the about the  <br>01:00:47.839 correlation between their perception of  <br>01:00:49.440 their body image and their own mental  <br>01:00:50.720 health and the link between the two sure  <br>01:00:53.640 sure do you see a lot of that do you see  <br>01:00:55.240 this link between Health in male body  <br>01:00:57.160 image yes huge proportion of  <br>01:01:00.799 psychological proclivities are genetic  <br>01:01:03.200 the others are very individually  <br>01:01:05.720 acquired they change through time it's  <br>01:01:07.920 not as easy as saying upbringing or  <br>01:01:09.680 family environment so the one consistent  <br>01:01:12.160 thing about how you relate to the world  <br>01:01:13.760 in your own thoughts is genetics and a  <br>01:01:16.400 lot of the traits tend to aggregate  <br>01:01:18.400 together so it is true to say on a  <br>01:01:21.839 spectrum very nuanced that some people  <br>01:01:25.240 aggregate a lot of negative  <br>01:01:26.799 psychological traits and some people  <br>01:01:28.920 aggregate a lot of positives and there  <br>01:01:30.520 absolutely people everyone's a mixed bag  <br>01:01:32.039 somewhere in between but there's a  <br>01:01:33.119 little bit of this kind of I don't want  <br>01:01:34.960 to use a a term for another mental a  <br>01:01:37.240 bipolarity to the distribution right and  <br>01:01:39.839 so a lot of people that are generally  <br>01:01:42.359 neurotic they feel consistently uh  <br>01:01:45.160 unsafe and unsure of themselves are  <br>01:01:47.440 going to be also the type of people that  <br>01:01:49.160 when they get more jacked through  <br>01:01:50.359 lifting they're still not going to  <br>01:01:51.920 believe that they're as jacked and  <br>01:01:53.400 accomplished and awesome and alpha male  <br>01:01:55.279 as they really are because they're  <br>01:01:56.839 always like you know to use the old  <br>01:01:58.640 Jewish joke stereotype  <br>01:02:00.319 like I'm never going to be big and it's  <br>01:02:02.960 like you're already big like oh I don't  <br>01:02:04.599 know it could get it could get worse  <br>01:02:06.039 tomorrow and a lot of people just bring  <br>01:02:08.680 that to the table and so when you get  <br>01:02:10.799 neurotic people jacked they don't think  <br>01:02:12.520 they're that jacked they're always like  <br>01:02:13.760 oh my God it's always going to end but  <br>01:02:15.440 if you take not neurotic people and make  <br>01:02:17.839 them jacked one week of lifting into  <br>01:02:20.799 those people and they're like dude I'm  <br>01:02:22.079 like do you think I should turn pro in  <br>01:02:23.640 bodybuilding like get out of here you're  <br>01:02:25.119 just overon  <br>01:02:26.480 so it really depends on who's doing the  <br>01:02:28.319 thing now cultural stuff social who's in  <br>01:02:30.920 your circle I'll give you a good example  <br>01:02:33.520 I have a lot of my closest friends have  <br>01:02:36.520 no relation to Fitness whatsoever a  <br>01:02:38.279 bunch of them are actually  <br>01:02:38.920 neuroscientists just randomly people I  <br>01:02:40.880 knew in college that ended up being my  <br>01:02:42.319 friends for life and so when they assess  <br>01:02:45.079 their muscularity relative to myself and  <br>01:02:47.520 my bodybuilder friends they're like I'm  <br>01:02:50.079 in terrible shape and I'm not remotely  <br>01:02:51.599 jacked and they have such a weird  <br>01:02:53.440 comparator population that I always  <br>01:02:55.039 remind them like dude dude not everyone  <br>01:02:56.599 looks like this they go to the store  <br>01:02:57.760 they go to school they go to the bank  <br>01:02:58.720 and they're like oh crap you're right  <br>01:03:00.359 I'm actually the most jacked person at  <br>01:03:01.720 the bank it's just not like Gold's Gym  <br>01:03:03.480 where everyone's enormous so if you  <br>01:03:05.319 happen to be in an environment let's say  <br>01:03:07.400 you're a university student and you go  <br>01:03:08.920 to the University gym and there's lots  <br>01:03:10.559 of jacked people there and you're there  <br>01:03:11.839 all the time trying to do your best you  <br>01:03:13.960 may if you're neurotic to begin with  <br>01:03:15.720 more neurotic start to develop a sense  <br>01:03:17.839 that you're just not nearly as jacked as  <br>01:03:20.400 you should be or could be or whatever  <br>01:03:22.200 but if you like hang out at an old  <br>01:03:23.480 people home with your grandma and  <br>01:03:24.599 grandpa all the time you're going to  <br>01:03:25.799 feel like Superman all the time because  <br>01:03:27.480 holy [ __ ] you're like you can do real  <br>01:03:28.960 things and move furniture around and and  <br>01:03:31.400 so then go back to that point about  <br>01:03:32.440 weight loss if I'm trying to lose weight  <br>01:03:34.200 what are the biggest biggest myths  <br>01:03:36.200 around weight loss that hold people back  <br>01:03:38.440 and inhibit them one is you have to be  <br>01:03:40.839 perfect if I'm on my diet I'm good if  <br>01:03:43.880 I'm off my diet not only am I bad but as  <br>01:03:46.599 soon as I'm off my diet I have sinned  <br>01:03:48.880 and there is no Solace for me um I a lot  <br>01:03:53.279 of people have that falling off the  <br>01:03:54.520 bandwagon thing where eat clean food  <br>01:03:57.400 whatever that means diet food for weeks  <br>01:03:59.880 and weeks and weeks they have one Kebab  <br>01:04:01.799 they have one cheeseburger and they're  <br>01:04:03.039 like do it that's it man I'm done  <br>01:04:06.880 dieting I'm not a good person anymore  <br>01:04:08.599 it's like that whole dichotomizing and  <br>01:04:11.119 kind of a religious approach that hurts  <br>01:04:13.440 a lot of people because in reality if  <br>01:04:15.760 you just Eat A Cheeseburger your body's  <br>01:04:17.559 like oh sweet like I got a little bit  <br>01:04:18.960 more carbohydrates stored in the muscle  <br>01:04:20.960 I recovered a little bit more my diet  <br>01:04:22.720 fatigue is actually a little lower  <br>01:04:23.839 because you fed me some food tomorrow  <br>01:04:26.160 I'm back on the diet I'm making even  <br>01:04:27.559 better gains than if I didn't have that  <br>01:04:28.839 cheeseburger I was so exhausted and so a  <br>01:04:31.680 lot of people have that approach  <br>01:04:33.240 completely backwards and they're like  <br>01:04:34.480 I'm either good or I'm bad and and  <br>01:04:36.559 that's really tough another one is  <br>01:04:38.960 people think that the approach to lose  <br>01:04:41.160 weight is the same as the approach to  <br>01:04:43.039 maintain it um this is really really  <br>01:04:45.680 really nasty because so my wife is a uh  <br>01:04:48.839 board-certified uh Family Med Sports Med  <br>01:04:51.400 doctor and she does a lot of work  <br>01:04:53.720 international Olympic teams all that  <br>01:04:55.200 stuff  <br>01:04:56.279 and she is looking at these formal  <br>01:04:59.079 recommendations from the medical  <br>01:05:00.520 literature and it's like here's the kind  <br>01:05:02.599 of diet you need to get to lose weight  <br>01:05:05.480 and then she was like she followed up  <br>01:05:07.079 with some of the professionals and she's  <br>01:05:08.240 like and so what about maintenance and  <br>01:05:09.640 they're like uh yep what do you mean yep  <br>01:05:13.559 what are you talking about that's not  <br>01:05:15.400 the conversation so people think okay  <br>01:05:17.480 I'm going to clean up my diet no more  <br>01:05:19.039 ice cream no more no more crisps no more  <br>01:05:21.000 Cheetos I'm gonna eat super healthy and  <br>01:05:23.960 then when I get to the weight that I  <br>01:05:25.279 want  <br>01:05:26.480 I eat continuously super Health never  <br>01:05:29.799 have ice cream again what kind of  <br>01:05:31.520 bizarre world is it and so they'll flop  <br>01:05:33.359 back to the other one well they'll try  <br>01:05:35.000 for a few months after they've gotten to  <br>01:05:36.359 the weight they like to just eat  <br>01:05:37.760 completely super healthy clean  <br>01:05:39.200 everything like that they lose a little  <br>01:05:40.400 bit more weight they're exhausted  <br>01:05:41.760 they're tired they're food focus is  <br>01:05:43.200 driving them nuts they'll eat some ice  <br>01:05:45.319 cream and they'll go I'm a sinner and  <br>01:05:47.720 then ice cream ice cream cheeseburgers  <br>01:05:49.440 cheeseburgers up they go and then they  <br>01:05:51.200 regain all the weight so a huge myth is  <br>01:05:53.640 the fact that yeah when you're you're  <br>01:05:55.760 losing weight you got to pay a little  <br>01:05:57.079 bit more attention to what you eat but  <br>01:05:58.960 once you've gotten to that weight you  <br>01:06:01.079 both need some time roughly every 3  <br>01:06:04.079 months that you diet hard to lose weight  <br>01:06:06.520 you should be taking about at least two  <br>01:06:08.000 months at maintenance just maintaining  <br>01:06:09.720 it so if you weigh 100 kilos iron down  <br>01:06:11.799 to 90 after 3 months for about two or 3  <br>01:06:14.559 months just stay at 90 eat mostly the  <br>01:06:17.240 healthy stuff that you were but throw a  <br>01:06:18.760 little junk in there maintenance again  <br>01:06:20.799 is much easier than losing when  <br>01:06:23.760 physiologically and psychologically your  <br>01:06:26.240 diet fatigue comes down after those two  <br>01:06:28.160 or three months you're able if you'd  <br>01:06:30.319 like to start dieting really hard again  <br>01:06:32.839 to get to that next goal that you have  <br>01:06:34.599 or you just live in balance for the rest  <br>01:06:36.680 but if we tell you like here's your diet  <br>01:06:38.400 to make you lean and healthy and you're  <br>01:06:39.520 like okay how long do I have to do this  <br>01:06:40.640 and the doctor's like  <br>01:06:42.279 forever what what am I supposed to do  <br>01:06:44.359 I'm never I'm never allowed to have  <br>01:06:45.480 teramis Su after dinner ever again I'm  <br>01:06:47.240 like well probably not to that's  <br>01:06:49.279 terrible advice and not only do medical  <br>01:06:50.920 people too often say that most people  <br>01:06:53.039 have that in their heads and it's it's a  <br>01:06:54.520 very very untenable sitation one of the  <br>01:06:56.599 big sort of narratives that I was  <br>01:06:59.079 exposed to for most of my life about  <br>01:07:00.720 weight loss is that 80% of its  <br>01:07:03.799 diet what do you think about those  <br>01:07:05.680 ratios how much of weight loss is  <br>01:07:07.240 determined by diet versus exercise  <br>01:07:10.480 yeah diet has a bigger effect than  <br>01:07:14.000 exercise as a heuristic I'm very  <br>01:07:16.240 comfortable with 8020 there are a couple  <br>01:07:18.480 reasons for that one  <br>01:07:21.200 is there's a constrained energy  <br>01:07:24.200 hypothesis  <br>01:07:25.920 it's also called ponor Paradox based on  <br>01:07:28.119 Herman ponor work and physical  <br>01:07:29.960 anthropology and  <br>01:07:31.960 so basically they realize that the  <br>01:07:34.720 amount of physical activity that humans  <br>01:07:36.559 can do has a range but if you try to get  <br>01:07:40.520 people to like double their physical  <br>01:07:42.559 activity you say I'm not going to change  <br>01:07:44.240 my diet I'm GNA work out twice as much  <br>01:07:46.559 as the next guy your body becomes so  <br>01:07:49.760 fatigued so rapidly and your metabolism  <br>01:07:52.799 adjusts itself your physical activity  <br>01:07:54.799 that's not planned exercise like how  <br>01:07:56.799 much do you get up when someone calls  <br>01:07:58.640 you are you still on the couch talking  <br>01:08:00.039 to them or how much do you get up and  <br>01:08:01.400 walk around your kitchen a bunch your  <br>01:08:03.559 body makes all these adjustments so if  <br>01:08:05.680 you try to really outwork a bad diet it  <br>01:08:08.880 doesn't work and usually you just come  <br>01:08:10.839 back to the same physical activity  <br>01:08:12.240 because you're too exhausted to continue  <br>01:08:13.680 and then you failed whereas with diet  <br>01:08:16.600 you can make some dietary changes  <br>01:08:18.520 principle based like stop eating junk  <br>01:08:21.279 food every day and just eat two pieces  <br>01:08:23.839 of junk food on Friday and two pieces of  <br>01:08:26.158 junk food on Saturday just that alone is  <br>01:08:29.080 sustainable your body as long as these  <br>01:08:31.120 are filling Foods a lot of veggies  <br>01:08:33.479 fruits whole grains lean meats you're  <br>01:08:35.279 not hungry you're just like damn it I  <br>01:08:37.679 want a bag of chips that's not a reason  <br>01:08:40.279 that is mostly psychological it's not  <br>01:08:42.080 physiological and thus dieting is just  <br>01:08:44.839 able to take bigger chunks out of your  <br>01:08:46.920 calorie balance equation without  <br>01:08:49.000 completely destroying it that has limits  <br>01:08:50.640 as well you can't D it forever so you  <br>01:08:52.759 have to take it in chunks another thing  <br>01:08:54.759 is this in order  <br>01:08:56.839 to burn a lot of calories to lose a lot  <br>01:09:00.600 of weight you got to do some serious  <br>01:09:03.560 work the average person will burn  <br>01:09:05.679 something like 100 to 150 calories per  <br>01:09:09.799 mile  <br>01:09:11.040 run oh my God you start thinking about  <br>01:09:13.560 it like a doughnut has 300 calories how  <br>01:09:17.000 fast Stephen can you eat a doughnut if I  <br>01:09:18.799 time  <br>01:09:19.719 you 5 Seconds five no problem boom you  <br>01:09:23.600 going to run three miles after each  <br>01:09:25.040 donut it's insane so taking your diet  <br>01:09:28.799 cleaning it up reducing the junk  <br>01:09:30.040 reducing the calories is not that hard  <br>01:09:32.759 but if you try to fight off the nasty  <br>01:09:34.920 extra junk food calories you're taking  <br>01:09:36.359 in with exercise it's kind of like a  <br>01:09:38.679 three to one fight you you eat two  <br>01:09:41.560 Donuts at your work function after work  <br>01:09:43.920 you got six miles to run that day nobody  <br>01:09:45.920 doing that and that's why diet is such a  <br>01:09:49.359 huge factor it's so easy to do quote  <br>01:09:51.439 unquote damage with it and it's much  <br>01:09:53.359 easier to take control of it versus  <br>01:09:55.520 exercise the boundary layers are just  <br>01:09:57.480 smaller and what you would have to do to  <br>01:09:59.320 fight the bad diet is just grotesquely  <br>01:10:01.440 large and outside of those boundary  <br>01:10:02.840 layers I think this a lot because I  <br>01:10:04.120 think people typically assume that the  <br>01:10:05.719 way to lose weight is to go do a run  <br>01:10:08.000 yeah that's typically you know you'll  <br>01:10:09.679 see people in the gym and if you ask  <br>01:10:11.199 someone why they're on the running  <br>01:10:12.360 machine they'll probably say I'm trying  <br>01:10:13.440 to lose some weight  <br>01:10:15.199 yeah it helps a little  <br>01:10:17.440 bit but if you run and you burn 200  <br>01:10:21.320 calories extra per day 3 days per week  <br>01:10:24.239 then is 600 extra calories you're  <br>01:10:25.920 burning through the week that's good  <br>01:10:28.159 stuff you can lose some decent weight  <br>01:10:30.360 like that are you just going to be more  <br>01:10:31.719 hungry though afterwards uh typically  <br>01:10:34.120 exercise does not dependably increase  <br>01:10:36.159 your hunger in most people so uh uh  <br>01:10:39.360 depending on the context in the  <br>01:10:40.640 individual it's not a Dependable thing  <br>01:10:42.360 to say that doing more exercise  <br>01:10:43.920 necessarily makes you more hungry which  <br>01:10:45.560 is kind of cool because usually you're  <br>01:10:46.880 not really any more hungry and if you  <br>01:10:48.520 stick consistently exercise but you  <br>01:10:50.440 control your diet you're good to go  <br>01:10:52.920 however is there a psychological  <br>01:10:54.000 component to that where because done the  <br>01:10:55.800 run I now feel like I deserve it oh yeah  <br>01:10:59.000 that's huge and some people do have a  <br>01:11:00.679 hunger response but what you put|### SUMMARY  <br>Dr. Michael Israetel discusses effective muscle building strategies, emphasizing minimal time investment and dispelling workout myths.  <br>  <br>### IDEAS:  <br>- Consistency is more important than the total workout hours for muscle building success.  <br>- Specificity in exercise routines leads to better results in targeted muscle growth.  <br>- Even minimal workout duration can yield significant body transformation with proper strategies.  <br>- Muscle gain is retained even after a period of inactivity, thanks to muscle memory.  <br>- Nutrition plays a crucial role in achieving fitness goals, alongside exercise.  <br>- Individuals often overestimate the time required for fitness transformations; efficiency is key.  <br>- Many common fitness myths hinder progress, including the need for extensive gym hours.  <br>- Recovery and nutrition are just as important as the workout itself for muscle growth.  <br>- Psychological factors significantly impact motivation and adherence to fitness routines.  <br>- Gym anxiety is a real concern that affects many newcomers to fitness.  <br>- Effective plans for muscle gain can be tailored to individual goals and lifestyle constraints.  <br>- Two to three sets of targeted exercises can lead to substantial muscle growth.  <br>- The right warm-up can enhance performance and prevent injuries during workouts.  <br>- Meal timing and nutrient quality can influence overall health and muscle growth.  <br>- Sustainable habits are crucial for long-term weight maintenance after reaching fitness goals.  <br>- Caloric intake

guys about spin right now**0:21**spin right might be an unlikely choice**0:23**for a Linux related YouTube channel and**0:25**it kind of is but the thing is this**0:27**application does have a use case for**0:30**Linux**0:31**users but what exactly is spin right**0:34**well spin right is a Dos utility and its**0:36**main purpose is to prevent and recover**0:39**from data loss and hard drive failure**0:41**respectively spin R is run from a USB**0:43**flash drive or CD so it bypasses the**0:46**underlying operating system of your**0:47**computer or server once booted it'll**0:49**give you a choice of a few different**0:50**types of scans or levels and once you**0:53**run a desired test against a drive you**0:55**simply wait for the results I'll talk**0:57**more about spin right's capabilities as**0:59**well as its pros and cons later in the**1:01**video now before we get started though IWhy make this video?**1:03**just wanted to mention that this video**1:05**is not sponsored by GRC the creator of**1:08**spin rate now actually I don't even know**1:10**if GRC is even aware that this channel**1:12**even exists I've been using this app for**1:14**quite some time and I decided a long**1:16**time ago to do a video about it the**1:19**thing is back then it was mentioned that**1:21**6.1 was being worked on so I decided**1:24**that it just didn't make sense to create**1:26**a video about something that was going**1:29**to just be updated dated so I decided to**1:30**wait and that wait turned into well**1:33**quite a long time but now 6.1 is finally**1:36**out and I decided to give it a review in**1:38**this video but perhaps the bigger**1:40**question though is why is the Linux guy**1:42**reviewing a Dos application well here's**1:45**the thing there's a great deal of Linux**1:47**administrators and homeb fans within my**1:49**audience when it comes to my home lab**1:51**audience one of the many amazing things**1:53**that they do is keep servers out of**1:54**landfills and that's awesome people that**1:57**are into self-hosting regularly**1:59**repurpose out ofate corporate equipment**2:01**all the time since servers that may no**2:02**longer be good enough for the Enterprise**2:04**are still plenty good enough for all of**2:05**you mad scientists out there now keep in**2:08**mind if you repurpose old servers then**2:10**you're also repurposing old hard drives**2:12**and that brings me to the first benefit**2:14**that spin right has for Linux users if**2:16**you purchase a secondhand server running**2:18**spin right on it before you put it into**2:20**production can only benefit you as spin**2:23**right can trigger error correction on**2:24**hard disk better than the OEM tools can**2:27**this way if there's any problematic**2:28**sectors on any of your hard discs it's a**2:30**good idea to have them detected before**2:32**you put a server into production not**2:35**after now for those of you that have had**2:37**servers in production for a long time**2:39**it's a good idea to run spin rate on**2:41**those every now and then maybe every**2:43**year or so that's just a personal**2:44**opinion on my side but it shouldn't hurt**2:47**you might even find that your Hardware**2:48**performs better after doing so I mean**2:51**your family can be without the Plex**2:53**server for a little bit can't they maybe**2:54**it's a good excuse to go**2:56**outside another use case for spin right**2:59**is for data recover recovery in fact**3:01**spinrite is one of three bootable tools**3:03**that I feel every administrator needs**3:05**the other two being mem test 86 and a**3:07**live image of your favorite Linux drro**3:09**now if you've potentially lost files**3:11**perhaps your devices and booting then**3:12**running spin right against the drive**3:14**might actually help you get your files**3:16**back it's possible that spin right's**3:18**airor correction might even repair the**3:19**drive but I figure if you have to go**3:21**through a bunch of work to get your**3:23**files back you may not want to trust**3:25**that drive any longer but I**3:27**digress data recovery features make spin**3:30**very useful in the Enterprise but home**3:31**users can definitely benefit from that**3:33**too now the way that spin right works ifWhat exactly does SpinRite do?**3:35**I put it very simply is that it gives**3:37**your hard disk a bit of a workout it**3:39**writes complex data to sectors in order**3:40**to test their read and write capability**3:43**and if there's a problem here the sector**3:44**will be marked bad and another will**3:46**replace it now to be fair so far that's**3:49**nothing unique even the manufacturer's**3:51**tools can do what I just described and**3:53**you can also do the same thing with open**3:55**source tools and there's probably a**3:56**dozen or so other ways I could think of**3:59**but the value of spin right is that it**4:01**tries really really really hard and**4:03**focuses very intensely on your disc more**4:06**intensely than even the manufacturers**4:08**tools generally do basically spinrite**4:10**has just one job and it does it very**4:12**well sorry to interrupt my own video butCheck out the updated merch shop! merch.learnlinux.tv**4:15**I just wanted to let you know that I**4:17**appreciate each and every single

really appreciate it now let's**5:03**get back to the**5:05**video more specifically there's threeSpinRite's "Levels"**5:07**different operating modes or levels of**5:09**spin right and the one that you'll end**5:11**up using depends on your needs level one**5:13**is a more basic read test that's not**5:15**super intensive but is good enough to**5:17**make sure all the data on your hard**5:18**drive is readable level two on the other**5:20**hand kicks things up a notch and**5:22**attempts recovery of any data found on**5:24**your drive that might not be readable**5:26**that's why if you want to perform data**5:27**recovery you might want to consider**5:28**starting here**5:30**level three is the most intensive**5:31**rewriting all data on your drive this**5:34**will help ensure that all data resides**5:35**only in sections of your hard disk known**5:37**to be within normal operation however**5:40**this test might take a lot longer to**5:41**complete if you want to check out spinSpinRite purchase and setup experience**5:43**right for yourself it'll set you back**5:45**$89 so this isn't free software but I**5:48**figure that the price tag is reasonable**5:50**for how useful it is and who knows maybe**5:52**someone within my audience will find it**5:54**useful once purchased you'll receive a**5:56**ridiculously tiny executable that's so**5:58**small you'll probably think think that**5:59**your download was disconnected but no**6:02**it's really that small this executable**6:05**will only run on Windows unfortunately**6:06**but you only have to run it once since**6:08**what it does is write spin rate to a**6:10**bootable Drive such as a flash drive of**6:13**course you can create bootable spin rate**6:14**media on Mac OS and Linux as well**6:17**there's an image file that's included**6:18**that you can use with your platform's**6:20**respective dis utility to create the**6:21**media now it's recommended that you use**6:23**the windows tool though but if you're**6:25**oppositional you could always write the**6:26**image**6:27**manually now before you go and thisThe downsides of SpinRite**6:30**though there are a few important**6:31**downsides to consider first in order to**6:34**use spin rate you'll need to modify the**6:35**settings of your host device in**6:37**particular what you'll need to do is**6:39**boot into Bios mode and also disable**6:41**secure boot now the author spin right is**6:44**quick to caution against disabling**6:45**secure boot unless you read the**6:47**documentation first so that way you can**6:49**understand if there's any other**6:50**ramifications of doing so generally**6:53**speaking you'll switch your computer to**6:54**Bios mode and disable secure boot run**6:57**spin right and then go back to your**6:58**computer settings and set everything**7:00**back to the way it was before continuing**7:01**to use it it sounds like a pain and well**7:04**it is but thankfully Steve mentions that**7:07**future versions will address this my**7:09**advice is rather than changing your**7:10**computer settings you could repurpose an**7:12**old desktop as a spin right machine**7:15**which you could do is power it on**7:16**disable secure boot switch it to Bios**7:18**mode and then leave it powered off then**7:21**what you could do anytime you want to**7:23**use spin right is you could take the**7:24**drive out of the device and just run it**7:26**from the spin right computer but that**7:29**might be overkill for some of you but**7:30**who knows thankfully though the biggest**7:33**downside has been addressed in version**7:34**6.1 for the longest time spin right has**7:37**been very slow painfully slow and this**7:40**is another reason why I was waiting for**7:41**the latest version to come out before**7:43**reviewing it it was so slow that it**7:45**wasn't uncommon for me to leave a**7:46**machine running over the weekend and**7:48**most of the time a scan would be**7:49**finished by the time it came back**7:51**however 6.1 has a Rewritten engine that**7:53**is much faster than before and I could**7:55**definitely notice the difference in fact**7:58**this is the main selling point of the**7:59**new version I received 6.1 as a free**8:02**upgrade from having purchased the**8:03**original version a long time back and I**8:05**think this speed boost more than makes**8:06**it worth the wait another potential**8:09**downside when it comes to spin right is**8:11**that purchasing it can be somewhat like**8:13**an insurance policy that you may or may**8:14**not find useful I mean think of it this**8:16**way you don't know ahead of time if**8:18**you're going to suffer a data recovery**8:20**issue and have to recover data you can't**8:22**really know that ahead of time so if you**8:24**purchase spin rate you're purchasing**8:26**something for a problem that you hope**8:28**you never have but if you do have that**8:30**problem then well you hope that it's**8:32**useful and whether or not it's useful**8:34**really depends on the problem that**8:36**you're trying to solve spin right is not**8:38**something that's going to fix every hard**8:40**drive issue if your computer itself**8:42**can't even detect the hard drive then**8:44**spin right won't be able to do that**8:45**either so we need to have you know**8:47**reasonable expectations here but as long**8:50**as we do that then spin right is really**8:52**useful that said I think spin right is**8:55**worth the purchase sure it's one of**8:57**those things that you hope you'll never**8:58**need and if you do need it you hope to**9:00**be glad that you did get it but aside**9:03**from that it's also good for**9:04**preventative maintenance as well and it**9:06**might even give you a performance boost**9:09**now let me know what you think of spin**9:10**right or any other tool that I mention**9:12**on this channel in the description down**9:14**below I can't wait to read what you guys**9:16**have to say in the meantime though**9:17**definitely subscribe to learn Linux TV**9:19**for the latest in Linux if you haven't**9:21**already done that and I'll see you in**9:22**the next videoEnglish (auto-generated)|## SUMMARY  <br>The video presents a review of SpinRite 6.1, a data recovery tool for Linux users.

<br>00:00:07.240 Amazon says to you or by the way do you  <br>00:00:09.040 want that diaper that follows you around  <br>00:00:11.000 all those websites it's because your  <br>00:00:12.280 data is being sold behind the scenes  <br>00:00:13.759 through Brokers the average person now  <br>00:00:15.679 apparently has an attention span of 8  <br>00:00:17.199 seconds and the last big attacks in  <br>00:00:19.080 terms of where people's data was stolen  <br>00:00:20.880 was because of human error data literacy  <br>00:00:22.680 is the worst it's ever been now let's  <br>00:00:24.599 talk about data but not in the way that  <br>00:00:27.119 you think these social media companies  <br>00:00:29.240 gather our dat data so that they can  <br>00:00:31.439 generate revenue from advertisers that  <br>00:00:33.920 want to advertise to people with  <br>00:00:35.879 specific parts of data in mind your data  <br>00:00:38.600 that you create is often duplicated so  <br>00:00:40.879 for example if you own three devices I  <br>00:00:43.200 own an Apple Watch Android phone all of  <br>00:00:45.440 these things I'm repeating the same data  <br>00:00:47.160 I can never connect it I can never pull  <br>00:00:48.800 it apart because it's living in  <br>00:00:50.239 different companies it's my data but  <br>00:00:52.079 it's separated now be prepared to have  <br>00:00:54.920 your mind blown I met Michael a week and  <br>00:00:57.840 a half ago spent an hour and a half with  <br>00:00:59.480 him and my head literally blew off so I  <br>00:01:02.760 know for sure it's going to have some  <br>00:01:04.400 impact on  <br>00:01:06.620 [Music]  <br>00:01:11.040 you hi everyone and welcome to this  <br>00:01:13.520 episode of the podcast now let's talk  <br>00:01:16.200 about data but not in the way that you  <br>00:01:19.040 think look these social media companies  <br>00:01:22.600 gather our data so that they can  <br>00:01:24.840 generate revenue from advertisers that  <br>00:01:27.320 want to advertise to people with  <br>00:01:29.479 specific parts of data in mind and that  <br>00:01:33.040 is really really profitable for these  <br>00:01:37.320 companies but why should they own our  <br>00:01:40.159 data why should they be in charge of our  <br>00:01:42.159 data why shouldn't we be in charge of  <br>00:01:44.640 our own data why shouldn't we make money  <br>00:01:47.159 from our own data and how can our own  <br>00:01:49.560 data help us live a healthier and  <br>00:01:52.759 happier life that is the question that  <br>00:01:55.520 Michael Clark is going to answer today  <br>00:01:58.320 now be prepared to to have your mind  <br>00:02:01.399 blown I met Michael a week and a half  <br>00:02:03.799 ago spent an hour and a half with him  <br>00:02:05.399 and my head literally blew off so I know  <br>00:02:08.679 for sure it's going to have some impact  <br>00:02:10.360 on you so let's cue the music and ask  <br>00:02:12.840 ourselves the question why don't we own  <br>00:02:15.160 our own data and what can we do to get  <br>00:02:17.319 it back and potentially benefit from it  <br>00:02:26.330 [Music]  <br>00:02:35.519 all right folks let me tell you about  <br>00:02:37.400 iopn the internet of people iopn is the  <br>00:02:40.720 next iteration of the internet using  <br>00:02:43.000 revolutionary blockchain technology  <br>00:02:45.159 that's built on decentralized community  <br>00:02:47.200 ownership now when I say decentralized  <br>00:02:48.920 community ownership I mean it's not only  <br>00:02:51.239 controlled by a bunch of tech Giants  <br>00:02:53.400 instead everyone who's part of it has a  <br>00:02:55.680 say and a stake in how things run it  <br>00:02:58.000 gives regular people like me and you and  <br>00:03:00.319 businesses and Brands an easy and fair  <br>00:03:02.959 chance to grow and make some money and  <br>00:03:05.200 build communities iopn is making things  <br>00:03:07.879 happen through a few key verticals now  <br>00:03:10.400 let's go through them OPN chain is a  <br>00:03:12.920 Cutting Edge layer one blockchain that's  <br>00:03:15.720 efficient scalable and eco-friendly IE  <br>00:03:18.760 cognitive a set of AI tools changing how  <br>00:03:21.920 we develop apps yeah develop apps OPN  <br>00:03:24.920 verse a dynamic hyper realistic AI  <br>00:03:28.200 powered platform that's making web 3  <br>00:03:30.959 experiences better big organizations  <br>00:03:33.239 like Dubai multicommodity Center Dubai  <br>00:03:35.760 World Trade Center and Ras Al government  <br>00:03:38.360 are already seeing the potential with  <br>00:03:39.879 IOP in themselves it's about creating a  <br>00:03:43.000 web3 future where technology serves us  <br>00:03:46.319 you know us the people unlike what web 2  <br>00:03:49.120 did where we often end up serving big  <br>00:03:51.720 tech companies check out the internet of  <br>00:03:53.680 people today and see how you can  <br>00:03:55.200 leverage their ecosystem I promise you  <br>00:03:57.400 it's worth the Time Michael thank you so  <br>00:04:00.239 much for coming to join us on the show  <br>00:04:01.400 today that's a pleasure to be here some  <br>00:04:03.360 of what you said to me when I first met  <br>00:04:05.079 you scared the hell out of me um some of  <br>00:04:08.159 it excited me and that's why I was  <br>00:04:09.879 really Keen to get you on the show and  <br>00:04:12.000 share with our audience today this  <br>00:04:15.360 fascinating world of data and to be  <br>00:04:18.199 honest with you most people are naive  <br>00:04:20.839 ignorant or or I just choose maybe not  <br>00:04:25.360 to want to know what's going on in the  <br>00:04:27.120 world these these flash terms that keep  <br>00:04:28.960 being brought up now nowadays AI you  <br>00:04:30.919 know what does it mean and how can it  <br>00:04:32.360 Implement be implemented in your  <br>00:04:33.800 business you know Then followed with the  <br>00:04:35.800 chat GPT is the the the then the thing  <br>00:04:38.639 that's said and people don't really  <br>00:04:40.560 understand what's going on with that but  <br>00:04:42.360 one thing that I think that's really  <br>00:04:43.840 fascinating for me is that I as a  <br>00:04:46.120 content creator for many years have  <br>00:04:47.880 always been highly aware that these  <br>00:04:50.960 institutions these massive organizations  <br>00:04:53.039 the social media companies meta and  <br>00:04:55.199 Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok and  <br>00:04:57.400 Google and whatnot collect my data M and  <br>00:05:02.000 they collect it for their benefit Y and  <br>00:05:04.520 so that's the bit that I want to start  <br>00:05:06.360 out with you today okay I want to  <br>00:05:08.919 understand what you mean when you say  <br>00:05:11.759 they've got the data and it shouldn't be  <br>00:05:14.160 yours it should be yours yeah it's a  <br>00:05:16.360 really good point so when you when you  <br>00:05:18.120 think about what I think take a step  <br>00:05:19.880 back and ask yourself what data is  <br>00:05:22.080 that's the best place to start in a very  <br>00:05:23.600 non-technical way um I look at data as  <br>00:05:26.520 really our stories and our memories and  <br>00:05:28.960 our experiences so if you think about  <br>00:05:31.160 the photographs that you take the things  <br>00:05:33.440 that you want to keep they belong to you  <br>00:05:35.319 in a way but today they don't um you  <br>00:05:38.160 give them to others to look after um  <br>00:05:40.360 there's no insurance around what you  <br>00:05:41.720 hand over um so it could get lost at any  <br>00:05:44.199 moment um so if you start in that point  <br>00:05:46.400 and say okay if these are my stories and  <br>00:05:48.000 my memories how valuable are they to you  <br>00:05:51.039 because that's really where you should  <br>00:05:52.240 start and then you look at data in a  <br>00:05:54.240 very different way because today I think  <br>00:05:55.919 we've been brought up as you rightly say  <br>00:05:57.280 it's key to chat gbt um it's going to  <br>00:05:59.680 give you everything you want but if you  <br>00:06:01.360 break it down you know that's where you  <br>00:06:03.199 should start and say well actually data  <br>00:06:04.560 is personal to me and that's what it  <br>00:06:06.400 means and why shouldn't I own it um  <br>00:06:08.840 that's really the starting point in all  <br>00:06:10.120 of this so when we think about that then  <br>00:06:11.840 let's take some some some common example  <br>00:06:13.440 you say photographs so everything that  <br>00:06:15.919 that I produce as data so that can be  <br>00:06:19.039 stuff that I produce consciously but you  <br>00:06:21.199 know there'll be people that say I never  <br>00:06:22.400 use social media I don't produce data  <br>00:06:24.560 but for those people that think like  <br>00:06:26.120 that what type of data are they  <br>00:06:27.919 producing inadvertently that we can  <br>00:06:29.919 constitute in this conversation so think  <br>00:06:32.400 about how you got to the office this  <br>00:06:34.120 morning so Google Maps is a great  <br>00:06:36.199 example or any map software nopic on  <br>00:06:37.919 Google that journey to work generated  <br>00:06:40.479 data um unknown to you on your way to  <br>00:06:42.880 work you were  <br>00:06:44.080 commoditized because as you drive along  <br>00:06:46.960 people are now suddenly firing  <br>00:06:48.280 advertisements that you just say hey do  <br>00:06:49.680 you want to go to this place do you want  <br>00:06:50.759 to go to that place so even something as  <br>00:06:52.680 simple as driving to work is now making  <br>00:06:55.039 somebody else money but you never get  <br>00:06:57.000 access to that data yourself which you  <br>00:06:59.039 could have used for yourself um after  <br>00:07:01.400 the journey which is then you start  <br>00:07:03.680 thinking about it that way things start  <br>00:07:05.639 to get a bit more interesting because  <br>00:07:06.680 you start to ask yourself the question  <br>00:07:08.840 well what could I have done with that  <br>00:07:10.160 data if it was mine and why is it only  <br>00:07:12.680 being done this way okay that that's one  <br>00:07:16.000 of the big questions that we need to  <br>00:07:17.759 answer today give me some more examples  <br>00:07:20.759 that no not what you could do with it  <br>00:07:22.919 some examp like You' just given because  <br>00:07:24.199 I want to make sure that everyone's Can  <br>00:07:25.840 Be Touched by this so as soon as you  <br>00:07:27.759 just said that to me about Google Maps  <br>00:07:29.280 I'm like like I can go in and look at my  <br>00:07:31.000 map history and I can go and see all  <br>00:07:33.400 these different Journeys that I've taken  <br>00:07:35.080 even even if I've not put them into  <br>00:07:36.879 Google Maps corre so that that triggered  <br>00:07:40.000 me what give me another example of that  <br>00:07:41.919 so um even simple things like your Apple  <br>00:07:44.720 watch and things like that also think  <br>00:07:47.000 about it this way your data that you  <br>00:07:48.840 create is is often  <br>00:07:50.599 duplicated so for example if you own  <br>00:07:53.240 three devices I own an Apple Watch I own  <br>00:07:56.120 an Android phone all of these things I'm  <br>00:07:58.960 repeating the same data I can never  <br>00:08:00.599 connect it I can never pull it apart  <br>00:08:02.960 because it's living in different  <br>00:08:04.080 companies it's my data but it's  <br>00:08:06.159 separated so how many versions of you  <br>00:08:08.319 exist on a daily basis most people have  <br>00:08:10.159 about 100 passwords and don't realize it  <br>00:08:12.520 so your data is never connected which  <br>00:08:14.560 means you can never add to it which  <br>00:08:16.400 means you you're always repeating  <br>00:08:17.840 yourself almost so data is being sold  <br>00:08:20.639 constantly without you knowing behind  <br>00:08:22.159 the scenes but not only that you can't  <br>00:08:24.240 use it to solve your own problems let me  <br>00:08:26.199 explain to you what that means in very  <br>00:08:27.560 simple terms let's think about your  <br>00:08:29.120 health as a great example because we  <br>00:08:30.159 talked about this when we when we first  <br>00:08:31.599 met today not one person alive has a  <br>00:08:34.200 single view of their health um which  <br>00:08:36.519 means that we have all of these apps I  <br>00:08:38.120 have a whoop um a few people have an  <br>00:08:40.159 Apple Watch and so on but they're never  <br>00:08:41.559 connected they're never connected so it  <br>00:08:43.479 means we never get a really true picture  <br>00:08:45.880 of how our health is can we prevent  <br>00:08:47.839 things all of these things that we could  <br>00:08:49.640 if we owned our data and I think that's  <br>00:08:51.880 why ownership is really important  <br>00:08:53.320 because it's not about how much money I  <br>00:08:55.640 make from my data it's actually what it  <br>00:08:57.480 could mean for my life um how it could  <br>00:08:59.600 save my life um if I could connect that  <br>00:09:01.920 data myself wow okay so how do other  <br>00:09:05.920 companies use my data to make money this  <br>00:09:09.600 is like the hidden secret of the  <br>00:09:11.200 internet I think um and this kind of all  <br>00:09:13.519 started around 2003 um believe it or not  <br>00:09:16.399 in the marketing world Google bought  <br>00:09:18.440 AdSense and the internet before that was  <br>00:09:21.079 more of a library almost people  <br>00:09:23.120 connected communities so from like 2003  <br>00:09:25.680 where we are today a lot of then the  <br>00:09:27.760 data that we produce got sold um most  <br>00:09:30.200 people don't realize the way that Amazon  <br>00:09:32.959 says to you well by the way do you want  <br>00:09:34.680 that diaper that follows you around all  <br>00:09:36.720 those websites is because your data is  <br>00:09:38.440 being sold behind the scenes through  <br>00:09:39.839 Brokers and various other companies who  <br>00:09:42.000 are selling data every second to people  <br>00:09:44.399 who want that and a connecting bits of  <br>00:09:46.680 you to basically create that picture and  <br>00:09:49.240 create Revenue which is either for  <br>00:09:51.160 advertising and marketing for that  <br>00:09:52.640 company or data that other people would  <br>00:09:55.120 gladly purchase so they can understand  <br>00:09:57.000 your behavior to try and sell you  <br>00:09:58.839 another product  <br>00:09:59.959 right so let's let's take that as an  <br>00:10:01.240 example I'm a father let's say and I've  <br>00:10:03.160 got young children and I buy diapers  <br>00:10:05.440 okay the the the people that sell the  <br>00:10:07.160 diapers want to advertise to me because  <br>00:10:09.200 I buy the diapers and they can only do  <br>00:10:11.240 that by buying uh by advertising using  <br>00:10:13.399 the data that's sold to them essentially  <br>00:10:15.120 by Facebook and and other companies like  <br>00:10:16.959 that yeah yeah and also use the example  <br>00:10:18.360 in America there's well-known story that  <br>00:10:20.399 a child a girl got pregnant and didn't  <br>00:10:22.279 want to tell her parents but Amazon knew  <br>00:10:23.880 before her parents yes they collected  <br>00:10:26.120 all of the data about her and then they  <br>00:10:27.720 told the DAT Amazon told told her and  <br>00:10:29.839 then her parents found out from Amazon  <br>00:10:31.560 not their daughter because of how much  <br>00:10:33.600 data look as as time progresses we have  <br>00:10:36.600 you and I know we're going to talk about  <br>00:10:37.720 this is we'll have more data about us  <br>00:10:39.959 which will then build an even bigger  <br>00:10:41.440 picture about us and the question then  <br>00:10:43.079 is how much more control do we want  <br>00:10:45.120 about that because how personal it  <br>00:10:46.440 starts to become okay well this this for  <br>00:10:49.000 many people could be scary okay could be  <br>00:10:51.360 frightening first of all frightening the  <br>00:10:52.920 other people are using my data and I  <br>00:10:55.320 just take some simple examples that I'm  <br>00:10:57.160 sure that one or two viewers and  <br>00:10:58.720 listeners might be aware of an  <br>00:11:00.720 inappropriate photo yeah 100% you know  <br>00:11:03.079 an inappropriate photo of something  <br>00:11:05.240 intimate between you and your your wife  <br>00:11:06.839 or your husband that that piece of data  <br>00:11:09.040 you wouldn't want anybody else to see  <br>00:11:10.639 want but but actually there's lots of  <br>00:11:13.399 organizations that have access to it  <br>00:11:15.320 100% um that goes on on a daily basis um  <br>00:11:18.760 I use a term which is a bit  <br>00:11:19.880 controversial the way data storage is  <br>00:11:21.720 today is like unregulated  <br>00:11:23.279 banking um just give me let me sh me out  <br>00:11:26.240 and give you that comparison so today if  <br>00:11:28.240 I put 200 Durham or $20000 into a bank  <br>00:11:31.839 the bank insures me for that um they're  <br>00:11:34.519 also told what they can do with it  <br>00:11:36.320 usually is about 10 times the monetary  <br>00:11:37.839 value they can lend out and there's  <br>00:11:39.560 obviously other regulations and things  <br>00:11:41.000 and I can get it when I want subject to  <br>00:11:42.760 proving my identity and other factors if  <br>00:11:45.079 you think about your photographs today  <br>00:11:46.920 you will upload those but you're not  <br>00:11:48.920 insured if they're  <br>00:11:50.880 lost um and there are some privacy  <br>00:11:53.120 controls in terms of what these  <br>00:11:54.480 companies are allowed to do but they  <br>00:11:56.279 still can do other things if you commit  <br>00:11:57.959 and give your consent so the data  <br>00:11:59.760 related to those photographs can be used  <br>00:12:01.560 for monetization um and then afterwards  <br>00:12:04.040 then as long as you can prove who you  <br>00:12:05.200 are but sometimes they will lock you out  <br>00:12:06.560 anyway because you didn't give enough  <br>00:12:08.120 proof maybe you changed location that's  <br>00:12:09.800 happened to me personally so I always  <br>00:12:11.760 make the question what would be more  <br>00:12:12.920 important to you if your bank lost $200  <br>00:12:16.160 or a cloud provider lost 20 years of  <br>00:12:18.600 your  <br>00:12:19.440 photographs what would be more important  <br>00:12:21.279 to you now that's why I now think data  <br>00:12:24.639 is important to Everyday Life as water  <br>00:12:27.040 and I think data is more important than  <br>00:12:28.440 money because of that simple fact if you  <br>00:12:31.199 lost 20 years of your entire family  <br>00:12:33.320 because of mistake of a cloud provider  <br>00:12:35.320 with no insurance that would mean more  <br>00:12:37.320 to you personally I think than to any  <br>00:12:39.240 amount of money on this Earth good point  <br>00:12:42.639 okay so we know that these external  <br>00:12:45.639 organizations are monetizing the data  <br>00:12:47.680 that that they're gathering on us you  <br>00:12:49.959 you your essentially your belief is that  <br>00:12:53.720 you want to stop that and allow us to  <br>00:12:55.680 have the ownership of our own  <br>00:12:57.720 data so yes and no so um one is about  <br>00:13:01.839 Fair rewards so basically but I also  <br>00:13:05.240 want us to stop thinking about  <br>00:13:06.440 monetizing  <br>00:13:07.600 data because if we think of monetization  <br>00:13:10.399 of data as the answer to everything then  <br>00:13:12.399 that's we're losing sight of the power  <br>00:13:13.800 of data I think when you and I first met  <br>00:13:16.000 I use the term I think data is potential  <br>00:13:18.680 um because that's the other way I look  <br>00:13:19.760 at data it's the potential to innovate  <br>00:13:21.360 it's the potential to save lives and yes  <br>00:13:22.880 we'll make money from data but if that's  <br>00:13:24.959 our only lens on this then we're all  <br>00:13:27.079 missing out because I would even AR that  <br>00:13:29.680 even the ones today that make the money  <br>00:13:31.120 off our data have all missed out because  <br>00:13:33.720 they don't have a single view of our  <br>00:13:34.839 life they only have a version of our  <br>00:13:36.880 life so they can Amazon can only see my  <br>00:13:38.920 Amazon life they have no idea what I  <br>00:13:40.920 watch on Netflix for example so they're  <br>00:13:43.160 only building a version of me that they  <br>00:13:44.880 know so my argument is that if Apple  <br>00:13:48.519 could see all of my data and I allowed  <br>00:13:50.759 them to have it because I owned it it  <br>00:13:52.519 could be worth even more than they are  <br>00:13:53.839 today because they can give me utilities  <br>00:13:56.759 um to manage my health for example which  <br>00:13:58.360 connect all that data which we don't  <br>00:13:59.800 have today but also I could create my  <br>00:14:01.920 own utilities that help me manage my  <br>00:14:03.759 health or other things and yes of course  <br>00:14:05.639 I'll monetize my data which is a big  <br>00:14:07.720 part of the AI story today um where we  <br>00:14:10.079 know that a lot of people's data has  <br>00:14:11.480 being used to build AI without their  <br>00:14:13.000 knowledge but my argument is well we  <br>00:14:15.880 need Ai and AI needs us and a big part  <br>00:14:18.199 of that is also a fair reward for how  <br>00:14:20.199 our data has been used to create Ai and  <br>00:14:22.399 constantly how it's used so it's a  <br>00:14:23.839 mixture of the people who take our data  <br>00:14:26.639 today also getting benefit but more me  <br>00:14:29.440 as a consumer I also get a benefit  <br>00:14:31.720 because now what I'm using is a  <br>00:14:33.440 reflection of how unique I am and who I  <br>00:14:36.000 am rather than a generic view of  <br>00:14:38.959 myself if if you if if we take  <br>00:14:41.160 monetization and just park it for one  <br>00:14:42.759 minute and and and look at how those  <br>00:14:44.360 other companies use the data they're  <br>00:14:45.920 using the data so that it can be  <br>00:14:48.279 effective in certain ways the thing the  <br>00:14:49.839 thing that kind of resonates I'm curious  <br>00:14:51.519 about now is Health okay because that's  <br>00:14:54.880 the one thing that's the most important  <br>00:14:56.199 thing to all of us although some of us  <br>00:14:57.639 seem to be on a a mission of death a lot  <br>00:14:59.639 of the time um that bit that you said  <br>00:15:02.839 resonates me you you wear a whoop you  <br>00:15:04.560 know I wear a Garin and and and you've  <br>00:15:06.759 got your Apple watch and these two  <br>00:15:08.199 devices aren't talking to each other and  <br>00:15:10.279 that's just these two that are on your  <br>00:15:11.720 wrist let alone um all of the other  <br>00:15:14.399 information that's gathered about your  <br>00:15:16.040 health in different ways how can how can  <br>00:15:19.040 what you're proposing how can that help  <br>00:15:22.680 me so let me probably give a really I'm  <br>00:15:26.800 always open and honest with my my  <br>00:15:28.360 audience so recently um I was told you  <br>00:15:31.360 know you're at the age Spencer but you  <br>00:15:32.880 need to have a thumb put up your bum so  <br>00:15:34.639 that you can check your  <br>00:15:36.319 colon all right and I was like I  <br>00:15:38.360 probably been hearing that for five or  <br>00:15:39.759 six years and then someone who's a bit  <br>00:15:42.279 older than me a friend of mine he said  <br>00:15:43.800 to me said you need to get it done okay  <br>00:15:45.639 A friend of mine got sick he had some  <br>00:15:47.199 cancer blah blah blah you know you need  <br>00:15:48.480 to go and get it checked and so I was um  <br>00:15:51.440 I was reticent to go as I think most men  <br>00:15:53.519 are but I but I eventually conceded and  <br>00:15:55.720 went to the hospital here and um had a  <br>00:15:57.920 camera put where it shouldn't go and uh  <br>00:16:00.279 uh the work that was done to find out  <br>00:16:01.680 that I was all  <br>00:16:04.600 good that information  <br>00:16:07.639 there has impact on other information on  <br>00:16:11.160 other parts of my body and other parts  <br>00:16:12.600 of Health okay cancer is something that  <br>00:16:15.959 spreads into other parts of our body as  <br>00:16:17.560 an example when we when we own our own  <br>00:16:20.920 data are you suggesting that we're able  <br>00:16:24.319 essentially to combine all of this  <br>00:16:26.079 different information from the hospital  <br>00:16:28.000 that I went to here the American  <br>00:16:29.360 Hospital so the one five year or 10  <br>00:16:30.880 years ago I had my spinal surgery in  <br>00:16:32.560 London um to to the one where I had my  <br>00:16:35.279 my my clavicle done and the metal plate  <br>00:16:37.000 put in there when I fell off my bike at  <br>00:16:38.600 the medic Medicare place here um is it  <br>00:16:42.360 just Gathering all of that together and  <br>00:16:44.279 putting it in a place where there's that  <br>00:16:46.360 can be then read and understood and  <br>00:16:48.639 further diagnosis can be done to  <br>00:16:50.720 optimize my health correct and this is  <br>00:16:52.560 where the AI story comes in okay so  <br>00:16:55.240 today we've been told a narrative that  <br>00:16:57.160 AI is better than us right a lot of the  <br>00:16:59.360 narrative because it's created a divide  <br>00:17:01.000 in society right we have to admit that  <br>00:17:03.319 there's parts of the world that think  <br>00:17:04.480 it's going to solve everything we've  <br>00:17:06.000 ever had a problem with there's the  <br>00:17:07.760 other half of the world that are rightly  <br>00:17:08.959 concerned and think we're going to lose  <br>00:17:10.119 our jobs the reality is I think we're  <br>00:17:12.240 moving into an era of collaborative  <br>00:17:14.039 collaborative AI where humans and AI  <br>00:17:16.319 will work together but on people's own  <br>00:17:18.520 data so let's take your example um I  <br>00:17:21.760 work out quite a lot so when I first met  <br>00:17:23.799 my PT she knows nothing about me she  <br>00:17:26.160 only knows what I tell her yeah and then  <br>00:17:28.039 we figure that out through the sessions  <br>00:17:30.640 um it's lucky that she specializes in  <br>00:17:32.200 biomechanics so she can actually figure  <br>00:17:33.799 out as she goes along but wouldn't it be  <br>00:17:35.919 useful if you took all of that data that  <br>00:17:38.120 you've just collected and then you could  <br>00:17:40.120 show her where your injuries are what  <br>00:17:42.600 you have and then all a sudden then you  <br>00:17:44.160 get an excise program that's taken for  <br>00:17:45.679 you even your AI could probably say to  <br>00:17:48.480 you on all your data um hey Spencer um I  <br>00:17:51.760 can see all these injuries I can see  <br>00:17:53.200 bits about your nutrition maybe you want  <br>00:17:55.200 to think about XYZ because the reality  <br>00:17:57.559 is AI is not going to queue at cancer  <br>00:17:59.760 but with your own data might be able to  <br>00:18:01.360 prevent it because through predictions  <br>00:18:03.880 and patterns and past examples in your  <br>00:18:06.400 life I can bring all that data together  <br>00:18:08.400 and suddenly I have a different picture  <br>00:18:09.799 of you and this is the really important  <br>00:18:11.600 bit the way the AI is being developed  <br>00:18:13.520 today is trying to treat everybody the  <br>00:18:14.679 same with the way it reports and gives  <br>00:18:17.000 you Insight the reality is we're all  <br>00:18:18.480 unique the story you've just said is  <br>00:18:20.320 unique to you yeah so in a way only you  <br>00:18:23.360 can really self diagnose if because  <br>00:18:25.840 basically you'd have to go and see all  <br>00:18:26.919 of those doctors individually m someone  <br>00:18:29.440 who's amazing to piece that story  <br>00:18:31.120 together um but if you had all your data  <br>00:18:33.159 and AI was there all of a sudden now  <br>00:18:35.120 that story changes because what it's  <br>00:18:37.159 giving you advice on is what makes you  <br>00:18:39.440 unique which is those life events and  <br>00:18:41.799 that data effectively and we've  <br>00:18:44.039 established clearly now in the world not  <br>00:18:47.280 everybody's the same we know that people  <br>00:18:48.880 are different and so the same exercise  <br>00:18:50.440 program nutrition program or whatever it  <br>00:18:52.120 may be is not going to work on everyone  <br>00:18:54.400 how does how does that  <br>00:18:56.240 that how does that then get translated  <br>00:18:59.520 because if it's Gathering that  <br>00:19:00.679 information and it's suggesting it how  <br>00:19:03.200 is it suggesting it and and you know is  <br>00:19:05.000 it is it then providing that information  <br>00:19:06.960 to a holistic doctor that then says  <br>00:19:08.720 right I've understood everything now  <br>00:19:11.000 based upon all this information that's  <br>00:19:12.280 been gathered over the last 54 years of  <br>00:19:13.880 your life spener this is the direction  <br>00:19:16.039 you need to head in or is that going to  <br>00:19:17.600 be something that that that that that  <br>00:19:19.120 allows us to understand it so that we  <br>00:19:21.240 can then plan with it so this this opens  <br>00:19:23.200 up another question or at least an area  <br>00:19:25.480 of focus so a lot of the work that I've  <br>00:19:28.400 been doing doing in this space and it  <br>00:19:30.400 dawned on me that we also don't yet have  <br>00:19:33.240 the skills needed to interpret what AI  <br>00:19:35.080 is going to give us and and some of  <br>00:19:37.440 that's not our fault that's just our  <br>00:19:39.520 dependency on technology over time so we  <br>00:19:42.240 have to reason with ourselves and  <br>00:19:43.960 understand that we become visual  <br>00:19:45.559 thinkers um the average person now  <br>00:19:47.840 apparently has an attention span of 8  <br>00:19:49.559 seconds um the last big attacks in terms  <br>00:19:52.240 of where people's data was stolen was  <br>00:19:54.320 because of human error um and data  <br>00:19:56.559 literacy is the worst it's ever been so  <br>00:19:59.280 the the real value of ownership of data  <br>00:20:00.960 and I would argue treating data like an  <br>00:20:02.440 asset would mean children are now  <br>00:20:04.679 educated on how to read it how to think  <br>00:20:06.840 critically how to debate how to reason  <br>00:20:09.400 so that's the other reason that  <br>00:20:10.679 ownership of data is really important  <br>00:20:12.280 because then we will teach people how to  <br>00:20:14.440 read it um so look you're not I'm not  <br>00:20:16.720 saying you're going to replace your  <br>00:20:17.840 doctor but at least some of these things  <br>00:20:19.919 may give you advice which are not  <br>00:20:21.799 life-threatening and there will be a  <br>00:20:23.360 moment where we say well actually you  <br>00:20:24.559 probably should see a doctor because of  <br>00:20:26.559 what I can see but also your past  <br>00:20:28.080 history but you know what the thing the  <br>00:20:30.360 thing that sticks out for me more than  <br>00:20:31.799 anything else is is the whole preventing  <br>00:20:33.880 correct you know for me it's like if if  <br>00:20:36.360 people  <br>00:20:37.559 knew that they this data could help them  <br>00:20:41.360 prevent yeah getting cancer which  <br>00:20:43.559 impacts one in two people one or two  <br>00:20:45.120 women anyway um on this planet that that  <br>00:20:49.679 that  <br>00:20:52.760 literally will save more lives than a  <br>00:20:55.320 war on or apocalypse would ever take let  <br>00:20:57.520 me give you a real good example I met  <br>00:20:59.360 this lady on a plane I'm I'm sure she  <br>00:21:00.720 will remind me telling this story um I  <br>00:21:03.480 got in a plane and there was a lady  <br>00:21:05.039 opposite me very sitting in a very  <br>00:21:06.240 uncomfortable position um I she had  <br>00:21:08.360 pillows and towels and things and I  <br>00:21:10.279 asked her we got talking and I said why  <br>00:21:12.240 are you sat like that she said back  <br>00:21:13.679 cancer I said how did you find that out  <br>00:21:16.159 and she broke her back in the gym  <br>00:21:17.919 training um which was unusual because  <br>00:21:20.039 she was so young so the doctor analyzed  <br>00:21:22.480 unfortunately you've got back cancer and  <br>00:21:23.880 you're stage four right months and  <br>00:21:27.200 months and months later shakula  <br>00:21:29.400 doctors don't know how a mixture of what  <br>00:21:32.120 she thought she should do with medical  <br>00:21:34.520 advice but whatever it did it worked  <br>00:21:37.559 she's a life coach so I asked her I said  <br>00:21:39.640 well what did you do she said well I  <br>00:21:41.360 can't remember really but because I'm a  <br>00:21:43.240 life coach now people now want me to  <br>00:21:44.679 help them in a similar position and I  <br>00:21:46.880 said to her well if you owned your data  <br>00:21:49.720 you could have collected everything that  <br>00:21:51.039 you did and then wouldn't it be amazing  <br>00:21:53.799 if you could share that value with  <br>00:21:55.000 someone else you take your data set and  <br>00:21:57.520 you give it to someone who's got the  <br>00:21:58.720 same as you and their AI combines their  <br>00:22:01.480 data with your data and suddenly they  <br>00:22:03.760 find the answer that's unique to that  <br>00:22:05.840 individual based on your learnings and  <br>00:22:08.000 who's to say you then give that to a  <br>00:22:10.159 pharmaceutical company who then instead  <br>00:22:12.200 of generating a pill they generate  <br>00:22:15.000 everybody an algorithm so that everybody  <br>00:22:17.200 then can follow that and manage their  <br>00:22:18.440 own health in a similar condition that's  <br>00:22:20.720 what we're talking about we have enough  <br>00:22:22.679 data in the world and enough technology  <br>00:22:25.080 now to get us to a place where if we  <br>00:22:27.200 treat data like an asset we could  <br>00:22:29.440 prevent much more than just the health  <br>00:22:33.880 side  <br>00:22:36.200 wow but wow with a which begs the  <br>00:22:39.679 question why has this not already  <br>00:22:42.880 happened it makes me makes me feel sad  <br>00:22:45.799 that something as as as remarkable and  <br>00:22:48.880 impactful as that that there there are  <br>00:22:51.960 so many more things in the world that  <br>00:22:53.279 we're spending time money and effort on  <br>00:22:54.760 right now but that seems to me as like  <br>00:22:57.480 the biggest game changer the planet  <br>00:22:59.120 could ever face it's a it's a history  <br>00:23:01.679 that's often been Untold um we've I've  <br>00:23:04.880 sold it wow that's massive though isn't  <br>00:23:08.120 it it is I as I just start and process  <br>00:23:10.960 that I mean it's like that if you could  <br>00:23:14.159 actually do that so if you take that to  <br>00:23:16.080 its full end degree with the technology  <br>00:23:18.480 we're having now when you're born I  <br>00:23:20.679 could give you a digital twin of view  <br>00:23:23.120 and I could AB test you based on your  <br>00:23:25.520 own data and what your parents inherited  <br>00:23:27.360 to you as a piece of data so if you were  <br>00:23:29.200 born with diabetes for example and your  <br>00:23:31.559 parents had diabetes or one of them  <br>00:23:33.360 throughout their life and they pass on  <br>00:23:35.360 that data belongs to them so they would  <br>00:23:37.520 give it to you as an inheritance and  <br>00:23:40.240 then you could run that on the AI which  <br>00:23:42.039 could be 20 years later digital twin  <br>00:23:44.200 technology exist where you can take a  <br>00:23:45.679 replica of a machine today I could take  <br>00:23:47.400 a replica R you and then use the same  <br>00:23:49.799 data to see what medication would work  <br>00:23:51.360 before I even give it to you that's a  <br>00:23:53.400 10year vision that is completely  <br>00:23:55.320 possible um but again you've got to  <br>00:23:57.640 start with not the technology and this  <br>00:23:59.559 goes back to your question why don't we  <br>00:24:00.919 have it now is because our focus is in  <br>00:24:03.039 the wrong place we see the technology as  <br>00:24:05.880 the answer but the real power has been  <br>00:24:07.480 there all along which is the data the  <br>00:24:09.799 identity and the value it  <br>00:24:11.760 generates so the more we SP Focus Less  <br>00:24:14.559 on technology and more on data what I'm  <br>00:24:17.400 describing is just literally scratching  <br>00:24:19.480 the surface health is just one example  <br>00:24:21.880 you you go on and on in terms of what we  <br>00:24:23.640 can see because the other problem is  <br>00:24:26.399 Spencer we've been brought up to believe  <br>00:24:27.720 that data means  <br>00:24:28.880 monetization but actually data is a  <br>00:24:31.000 utility and a store value at exactly the  <br>00:24:33.000 same time what does that mean well one I  <br>00:24:35.000 can use it to make money for myself if  <br>00:24:36.919 an AI uses my algorithm I'll get paid  <br>00:24:38.760 many times over which is great but the  <br>00:24:40.799 other amazing thing for me is I can use  <br>00:24:43.440 the create utilities I've just  <br>00:24:45.440 described um imagine you've got an AI  <br>00:24:47.720 with your data and suddenly it says to  <br>00:24:49.720 you Spencer you can see you've got a  <br>00:24:51.080 health app but you're missing some data  <br>00:24:53.240 that would help you why don't you go to  <br>00:24:55.000 a hike in some far off country you rest  <br>00:24:59.080 but you'll collect dat that's really  <br>00:25:00.600 valuable to others and you and you could  <br>00:25:03.240 sell that on an exchange and make some  <br>00:25:05.120 money for yourself but at the same time  <br>00:25:07.120 it would build a bigger picture of your  <br>00:25:08.520 health but improve your cardiovascular  <br>00:25:10.799 system it's like sold why wouldn't you  <br>00:25:13.760 yeah absolutely yeah gee man it's just  <br>00:25:18.000 like it's so exciting it's like it's  <br>00:25:22.159 like okay a lot of time a lot of time  <br>00:25:25.320 it's always about how can it be  <br>00:25:27.279 implemented okay you know what what are  <br>00:25:29.120 the practical steps of being implemented  <br>00:25:31.120 so I know that you've put some thought  <br>00:25:32.720 into this that's why you're sat here  <br>00:25:34.120 today but um tell me what when you had  <br>00:25:37.799 these realizations and the were these  <br>00:25:39.559 moments for you big moments like they  <br>00:25:41.159 are for as I'm listening to it now they  <br>00:25:42.919 they were yeah so so the story with this  <br>00:25:44.799 goes back four years I was asked to  <br>00:25:46.360 write a paper a very long time ago on  <br>00:25:48.520 what the future of data would be in 2030  <br>00:25:51.279 and I I kind of had those he in the  <br>00:25:52.760 moment you know here standing up moments  <br>00:25:54.320 in a room where it's was like it dawned  <br>00:25:56.279 on me this was much more important that  <br>00:25:57.960 I'd be asked to do um but it also dawned  <br>00:26:01.760 on me we need to do more um and we need  <br>00:26:05.600 to know more about this and that's kind  <br>00:26:07.640 of what started the journey I think we  <br>00:26:09.399 all have these moments where we find  <br>00:26:10.919 something or we start something and it  <br>00:26:12.320 gets bigger than ourselves this is what  <br>00:26:14.320 it became so yeah they then what I'm  <br>00:26:16.760 doing and what I've been have done is  <br>00:26:19.279 doing exactly what you just asked which  <br>00:26:21.000 is the steps to get there either for a  <br>00:26:23.080 government to put this in place so some  <br>00:26:25.080 of these longer term or even near term  <br>00:26:26.840 Things become a reality  <br>00:26:28.960 but also what are the fundamental things  <br>00:26:31.559 that we need in this but also not  <br>00:26:32.919 forgetting the role that people play in  <br>00:26:34.279 all of this which I think is close to  <br>00:26:36.159 your heart everyone we met as well  <br>00:26:37.399 talking about people and organizations  <br>00:26:38.960 and their roles and I'm sure we'll come  <br>00:26:40.919 on to that is their importance in it so  <br>00:26:42.799 yeah the the the steps are really  <br>00:26:44.039 important I can go through some of those  <br>00:26:45.840 if absolutely we need to go I want to be  <br>00:26:48.880 I want make sure everybody not only sits  <br>00:26:51.039 there and has just done what I've done  <br>00:26:52.480 as you've explained what you explained  <br>00:26:53.760 but you know what are these what are  <br>00:26:55.440 these moves that we need to make so if  <br>00:26:57.200 you think about so what makes ownership  <br>00:26:59.000 possible obviously starts with the  <br>00:27:00.720 regulator and the government um I'm  <br>00:27:03.279 fortunate to be living in Dubai and I  <br>00:27:04.919 can have those conversations and it's  <br>00:27:07.640 exciting and it probably won't surprise  <br>00:27:09.600 you how open they are to those  <br>00:27:11.240 conversations the first step in anything  <br>00:27:13.080 is recognizing people's legal right to  <br>00:27:14.600 own their data that's that's the first  <br>00:27:15.960 big tick um we mustn't underestimate the  <br>00:27:18.480 role of your identity with that because  <br>00:27:20.399 you are your data and that's how you  <br>00:27:21.760 prove yourself so those two are  <br>00:27:23.559 critically important I think then  <br>00:27:25.480 there's the awareness like this podcast  <br>00:27:27.799 is giv people that awareness but I think  <br>00:27:29.880 then regulators and other organizations  <br>00:27:31.520 then will have to make people aware of  <br>00:27:32.880 what that means in the near term people  <br>00:27:35.520 can help themselves um they can actually  <br>00:27:38.600 think more clearly about what they do  <br>00:27:40.279 with their data in the short term maybe  <br>00:27:42.360 work with companies where they can  <br>00:27:43.720 access their data and use it themselves  <br>00:27:46.600 um and just become more Curious over  <br>00:27:48.840 time some of the work I'm doing is  <br>00:27:50.679 helping build the curriculums for  <br>00:27:52.320 schools in terms of how children now can  <br>00:27:54.519 become critical thinkers again and learn  <br>00:27:57.080 to reason so then they will be in a  <br>00:27:58.720 position to actually use their data with  <br>00:28:00.480 an AI in the right way um but the  <br>00:28:03.480 biggest thing you know that's what you  <br>00:28:04.519 can do as individual and that's what  <br>00:28:05.600 needs to be done at a government level  <br>00:28:07.200 there's a raft of technology behind all  <br>00:28:08.919 of this I'm very fortunate to be working  <br>00:28:10.600 with people on those um but yeah that's  <br>00:28:12.679 your starting point one is educate  <br>00:28:14.200 yourself and build an awareness of these  <br>00:28:16.360 things and also ask yourself the  <br>00:28:18.200 question why and what could I do and the  <br>00:28:20.279 second part of the equation is  <br>00:28:21.320 unfortunately we can't do anything until  <br>00:28:23.279 the government gives us a helping hand  <br>00:28:24.720 and that's part of the work that I'm  <br>00:28:25.720 doing when you talk to governments about  <br>00:28:27.919 a subject matter like this do they  <br>00:28:30.039 immediately jump on it and say we get it  <br>00:28:32.039 we understand it we want to try and do  <br>00:28:33.440 something about it or do you get um for  <br>00:28:36.360 obvious reasons I would suspect push  <br>00:28:38.240 back a little bit of push back but  <br>00:28:40.399 that's only because I think the way that  <br>00:28:42.760 we've been taught what data is so we've  <br>00:28:46.080 touched on that we've been taught data  <br>00:28:47.640 is monetization we've also been taught  <br>00:28:49.880 that data is  <br>00:28:50.960 fear which is where data privacy comes  <br>00:28:53.320 from yeah so people have been I guess  <br>00:28:56.279 told it's scary to share your look after  <br>00:28:58.799 it don't use it so then we constantly  <br>00:29:01.679 have privacy rules when actually that's  <br>00:29:03.320 probably not the answer the answer is  <br>00:29:05.440 now ownership in Choice which is the  <br>00:29:07.600 conversation I have with the regulator  <br>00:29:09.000 to say look let's be realistic we're  <br>00:29:11.279 going to have an AI fairly soon that no  <br>00:29:13.080 one's ever going to be able to keep up  <br>00:29:14.200 with they the regulator so do we  <br>00:29:16.559 actually then say maybe there's a  <br>00:29:18.320 different model which is we give people  <br>00:29:20.399 the ownership and choice we give them  <br>00:29:21.799 the technology to do that and maybe the  <br>00:29:24.080 regulator then shifts their attention to  <br>00:29:25.679 what really matters which is security  <br>00:29:27.159 and ethics and then the game changes but  <br>00:29:30.320 then more importantly you talk to the  <br>00:29:31.720 regulator around look this isn't about  <br>00:29:33.720 monetization this is about giving people  <br>00:29:35.279 the things they've never had I would  <br>00:29:36.679 even argue what even businesses have  <br>00:29:38.480 never had and if you bring this into  <br>00:29:41.640 fruition you will open up innovation in  <br>00:29:43.919 a national level National level because  <br>00:29:46.320 you will now invite fex companies who  <br>00:29:49.399 will help people and businesses use data  <br>00:29:52.159 in the way that I'm describing so you  <br>00:29:53.840 create an ecosystem and an economy  <br>00:29:55.399 around this that's why it's exciting for  <br>00:29:57.320 the regulator because now you create a  <br>00:29:58.799 culture of innovation but also you  <br>00:30:00.919 create a new Workforce you build the  <br>00:30:03.760 Next Generation and you almost build you  <br>00:30:06.000 know the underpinnings of of a new way  <br>00:30:11.200 forward how cool is  <br>00:30:13.480 that talk to me about how you link the  <br>00:30:16.360 blockchain with the ambition here  <br>00:30:19.080 because I think that and again let's  <br>00:30:20.519 just make sure that there'll be there'll  <br>00:30:22.000 be people here that don't understand  <br>00:30:23.159 really what the blockchain has said I  <br>00:30:24.519 don't want to jump too too deep into  <br>00:30:26.679 that but I want people to to understand  <br>00:30:29.240 the connection because we just had uh in  <br>00:30:31.440 the Press yesterday uh an announcement  <br>00:30:33.840 that M2 is going to allow people to um  <br>00:30:37.360 uh trade trade their uh ethereum and  <br>00:30:39.919 Bitcoin in their local currency in their  <br>00:30:41.919 bank accounts here the government of Abu  <br>00:30:43.519 Dhabi have just to authorize that which  <br>00:30:45.519 I think will you know less and more and  <br>00:30:49.640 more take people to less and less fear  <br>00:30:51.480 around the whole world of crypto because  <br>00:30:53.760 it's becoming normalized and we heard  <br>00:30:55.720 what Trump's saying if he gets back into  <br>00:30:57.159 Power what he's going to do as well so  <br>00:30:59.159 that's I I hope bringing more people  <br>00:31:01.159 into this place of not thinking that you  <br>00:31:03.559 know crypto is some crazy nutty scam and  <br>00:31:06.320 and the blockchain and web3 is uh is  <br>00:31:08.279 Bonkers so just in really simple terms  <br>00:31:11.880 how are you doing what you're doing  <br>00:31:13.600 there so you've used the magic words so  <br>00:31:15.799 bit Bonkers no that is also a magic word  <br>00:31:18.360 because you haveed Bonkers to put the  <br>00:31:19.559 pieces together um so Bitcoin and  <br>00:31:22.639 ethereum I look at data as the brother  <br>00:31:25.080 and sister of both of them because  <br>00:31:27.240 Bitcoin is a story value MH ethereum is  <br>00:31:29.880 programmable data is  <br>00:31:31.960 both so what if you made data a  <br>00:31:34.679 token itself and what if you could store  <br>00:31:38.039 it on a ledger in terms of every time  <br>00:31:40.440 it's used who has it because that's  <br>00:31:42.039 really what the blockchain is right it's  <br>00:31:43.279 a mutable record of something that was  <br>00:31:45.760 stored in a ledger like in the olden  <br>00:31:48.000 days where we'd have a be some you know  <br>00:31:49.480 Ledger ins and outs big books big books  <br>00:31:51.760 right the lines in exactly now now now  <br>00:31:53.799 it's digital um and the currency is is  <br>00:31:56.720 is data uh my argument is the currency  <br>00:31:59.279 now is intelligence because actually  <br>00:32:01.600 what we're sharing is knowledge and I  <br>00:32:03.240 can tokenize it and I can store in a  <br>00:32:05.320 blockchain okay so let's let's just Dum  <br>00:32:07.440 that down a little bit okay tokenize it  <br>00:32:09.720 so we can create a a Bitcoin 2.0 or we  <br>00:32:12.799 can we can whatever we want to call it  <br>00:32:14.919 okay let's let's call it let's call it  <br>00:32:17.200 whatever we want but it essentially  <br>00:32:19.120 becomes its very own token that sits  <br>00:32:22.559 alongside all of the other tokens as as  <br>00:32:24.760 an asset that you can buy and trade and  <br>00:32:28.720 that that data itself then each each  <br>00:32:31.919 piece of data is owned by whoever the  <br>00:32:33.559 owner is correct and his access for a  <br>00:32:35.639 wallet that you hold the word asset  <br>00:32:38.639 though is what you said is really  <br>00:32:39.919 important um because a lot of the work  <br>00:32:42.000 I'm doing is making data into a real  <br>00:32:43.639 world asset so treating it like water so  <br>00:32:47.600 if you think of the outage that happened  <br>00:32:49.159 a few weeks ago or a week ago now isn't  <br>00:32:50.880 it um where you know major system change  <br>00:32:54.120 for the first time I guess locked us all  <br>00:32:55.880 out of our computers okay so the so for  <br>00:32:58.360 people that that aren't familiar with it  <br>00:32:59.919 here in the world recently if you're  <br>00:33:01.720 under under a rock we had they said  <br>00:33:04.639 someone turned a switch or fress a  <br>00:33:06.039 button somewhere in a cyber security  <br>00:33:07.639 company I foret Cloud strike I think it  <br>00:33:09.799 was and and basically many many people  <br>00:33:13.360 shops couldn't use their terminals to  <br>00:33:15.120 take payments and you know all kinds of  <br>00:33:17.639 computer systems crashed what that  <br>00:33:19.519 showed to me and I hope it showed to the  <br>00:33:21.519 world is that data is now as more  <br>00:33:23.480 important as life as long as water  <br>00:33:26.200 because because we couldn't access data  <br>00:33:27.960 because we couldn't use it in our jobs  <br>00:33:29.720 all of a sudden the world stopped right  <br>00:33:31.919 because really what the computer was was  <br>00:33:33.240 just a device to create and show a state  <br>00:33:36.320 so when we start saying well data is an  <br>00:33:38.720 asset and you ask me blockchain and  <br>00:33:40.880 token the real value is when it becomes  <br>00:33:43.159 a real world asset because now everybody  <br>00:33:44.840 touches that data becomes a critical  <br>00:33:46.480 service  <br>00:33:48.440 provider they become regulated in terms  <br>00:33:50.799 of how they handle and manage data like  <br>00:33:52.360 the water company so I can't imagine the  <br>00:33:55.000 water company ever having a crisis like  <br>00:33:56.679 that and nobody ever been able to drink  <br>00:33:58.440 water in in a development bills it's the  <br>00:34:00.840 same thing he would just put extra  <br>00:34:02.399 layers of Regulation and the companies  <br>00:34:04.519 that store your data today would also be  <br>00:34:06.360 treated as a regulated entity so then  <br>00:34:08.599 all of a sudden then you've got a  <br>00:34:10.440 technology that allows you to move data  <br>00:34:12.199 around securely and safely and makes it  <br>00:34:14.079 traceable which is what we're talking  <br>00:34:15.440 about but also then the companies and  <br>00:34:17.480 the facilitator and look after for you  <br>00:34:19.399 are also treated as critical service  <br>00:34:21.119 providers so everything then changes  <br>00:34:23.839 because then you look at data then as  <br>00:34:25.399 not something that belongs in a system  <br>00:34:27.399 but it's it's actually critical to  <br>00:34:28.760 everything that we do you know for your  <br>00:34:30.560 listeners have a think about when you  <br>00:34:32.159 had breakfast this morning to when you  <br>00:34:33.440 went to bed how many things did you  <br>00:34:35.239 touch gave you data the screen you  <br>00:34:37.399 looked at the alarm clock in the morning  <br>00:34:38.960 that's digital all of those things are  <br>00:34:40.800 data really and they become so important  <br>00:34:43.119 to everyday life that we've lost sight  <br>00:34:45.239 of it which is why the technology allows  <br>00:34:47.679 us to make this possible but at the same  <br>00:34:49.800 time the regulation then allows us to  <br>00:34:51.320 change our  <br>00:34:53.800 mindset can I want to I want to get back  <br>00:34:56.040 to getting to some some kind of like mic  <br>00:34:58.200 drop moments here so we can we can get  <br>00:35:00.240 people that might have got a little bit  <br>00:35:02.119 confused by that excited again we talked  <br>00:35:03.880 about health yeah okay what a g give me  <br>00:35:06.200 some other give me some other fun  <br>00:35:07.720 examples of where where our audience  <br>00:35:10.160 right now will S I didn't know it could  <br>00:35:12.200 do that that would be cool for me if it  <br>00:35:14.119 could do this give me a couple of  <br>00:35:15.359 examples around that kind of stuff so  <br>00:35:17.400 let's go let s Finance okay um so  <br>00:35:20.280 there's a few things one I actually  <br>00:35:21.359 really want to do I'm kind of giving it  <br>00:35:22.760 do I give this away give it away I don't  <br>00:35:24.680 G to do anything with it I think you  <br>00:35:26.520 could build a data Bond what's a data  <br>00:35:28.560 Bond so in in financial terms you can  <br>00:35:30.359 you can invest in a bond yeah so this is  <br>00:35:32.440 basically where a government or an  <br>00:35:33.680 organization wants to wants to borrow  <br>00:35:35.240 money so say they're building a property  <br>00:35:37.920 um or even a group of properties they  <br>00:35:39.800 would issue a bond and they'll collect  <br>00:35:41.400 the money from people who will then get  <br>00:35:43.400 make money out of that property  <br>00:35:44.839 development over time the interest rate  <br>00:35:47.079 is usually fixed Y and they M them once  <br>00:35:49.280 that that Bond matures everybody gets  <br>00:35:50.839 their money out I think everyone  <br>00:35:52.920 understands that simply essentially is a  <br>00:35:54.640 loan okay someone's making a loan to  <br>00:35:56.599 somebody at a fixed rate of interest and  <br>00:35:58.240 the person that's making the loan isn't  <br>00:35:59.480 going to lend the money themselves  <br>00:36:00.480 they're going to let everybody else come  <br>00:36:01.520 in and be part of that lending that  <br>00:36:03.200 amount of money being lent so everyone  <br>00:36:04.920 can share in that return correct okay so  <br>00:36:07.040 it could be a Government Bond could be a  <br>00:36:08.319 corporate bond okay so what's a data  <br>00:36:10.560 Bond exactly the same thing so the  <br>00:36:12.760 government says do you know what we need  <br>00:36:14.400 some data to do something maybe the data  <br>00:36:16.640 is important to understand an area in  <br>00:36:19.000 Dubai that people may have that data or  <br>00:36:21.280 maybe they're trying to build something  <br>00:36:22.319 to do with house and they're trying to  <br>00:36:24.240 the impact of cocoa pops who knows  <br>00:36:28.200 or maybe it's a research company trying  <br>00:36:29.800 to build you know some medication m and  <br>00:36:32.319 they need they need the data of people  <br>00:36:33.800 they can't get today people may have a  <br>00:36:35.400 unique allergies or certain things  <br>00:36:37.200 because take covid right even though the  <br>00:36:39.119 the medication was heavily tested  <br>00:36:41.240 there's always going to be outliers  <br>00:36:42.920 because you just don't have enough  <br>00:36:44.359 testing data to prove but could you  <br>00:36:46.800 issue a bond to say actually instead of  <br>00:36:49.319 trying to take this data from people why  <br>00:36:51.400 don't you contribute and every time and  <br>00:36:53.839 then every as we're building this you  <br>00:36:55.240 will get rewarded every time your data  <br>00:36:56.599 is used this is why it's so cool in a  <br>00:36:59.560 bond I get paid once because it's only  <br>00:37:01.680 for the property but that same data  <br>00:37:03.200 could get used seven times or more or  <br>00:37:05.839 more which means I get rewarded every  <br>00:37:08.000 time and the government could even take  <br>00:37:09.839 a clip of that take some money off that  <br>00:37:11.839 as a as a as a revenue generator so the  <br>00:37:14.400 government's making money government's  <br>00:37:15.960 getting data they need and everybody  <br>00:37:17.480 else is getting rewarded at the same  <br>00:37:18.680 time how is that data for for the  <br>00:37:21.760 average Joe guy goes to work every day  <br>00:37:23.640 works at KPMG just become partner wife  <br>00:37:25.920 works as I don't know whatever another  <br>00:37:28.000 business she's an accountant let's say  <br>00:37:29.319 as well and they live a normal life they  <br>00:37:31.839 got two kids they live in Arabian  <br>00:37:33.200 ranches or wherever it may be they they  <br>00:37:34.839 a very normal life how does that that  <br>00:37:37.160 man that's sitting listening to this  <br>00:37:38.640 right now going holy macaroni this  <br>00:37:40.640 sounds cool how does he then consciously  <br>00:37:43.839 is he able to harvest and harness his  <br>00:37:46.400 own data so he will today is going be  <br>00:37:49.520 difficult right let's be H let's be  <br>00:37:50.520 honest there'll be certain data that he  <br>00:37:51.760 can't get if we use the examples of  <br>00:37:53.640 government with healths that's a lot  <br>00:37:55.720 desperate today there may be some things  <br>00:37:57.800 though that on your Apple watch and  <br>00:37:59.000 device you can be able to get yourself  <br>00:38:01.319 um could be your step count could be  <br>00:38:02.880 your heart rate or anything that makes  <br>00:38:04.200 you unique that could easily be given  <br>00:38:06.480 today um and all it would take is a is a  <br>00:38:09.240 bank to issue a bond I think in Dubai  <br>00:38:10.920 they've just done social bonds um  <br>00:38:13.119 there's no reason why you couldn't do  <br>00:38:14.119 one for data um so what it starts to do  <br>00:38:17.720 is starts and this is why I hope this  <br>00:38:19.680 happens with people listening they start  <br>00:38:22.040 looking at the data and questioning what  <br>00:38:23.640 that data means and is it valuable and  <br>00:38:26.000 more importantly is it valuable to them  <br>00:38:28.560 before but is it is it not a case of of  <br>00:38:30.880 some  <br>00:38:32.040 people will listen to this and go yeah  <br>00:38:34.280 this is really valuable but I don't even  <br>00:38:36.160 know where to start where where is where  <br>00:38:37.839 is my data you  <br>00:38:39.520 know and it may be this is the infancy  <br>00:38:42.160 and that's what you're bringing bringing  <br>00:38:43.319 to the world but but you know as we can  <br>00:38:47.800 clearly currently we can store our  <br>00:38:49.880 cryptocurrency on an exchange or we can  <br>00:38:51.680 store in a store in a cold wallet right  <br>00:38:54.160 um and so we've got those two options so  <br>00:38:56.920 for those people people that don't know  <br>00:38:57.880 what a cold storage is just think of a  <br>00:38:59.560 USB stick it's like it's the easiest way  <br>00:39:01.319 to describe it you put it on a USB stick  <br>00:39:02.960 and you put the USB in your pocket  <br>00:39:05.440 so for for those people wanting to be  <br>00:39:08.200 able to to harness it there will come a  <br>00:39:11.040 time in the not too dist future where  <br>00:39:12.800 they can literally every piece of data  <br>00:39:15.440 that they produce can be collected in an  <br>00:39:17.680 automated fashion and go into their  <br>00:39:20.520 storage facility of that and that's when  <br>00:39:23.480 they're going to have the power over it  <br>00:39:24.960 there'll be companies so there are  <br>00:39:26.800 companies that exist already so this is  <br>00:39:29.040 not like the fantasy of someone writing  <br>00:39:30.760 this the cool bit is I get the chance to  <br>00:39:32.200 work with people doing it yeah so  <br>00:39:33.760 there's a company I work with in silic  <br>00:39:35.359 and Valley who are building a data  <br>00:39:36.520 wallet where basically you'll be able to  <br>00:39:38.680 do exactly what I've just described they  <br>00:39:40.119 launch pretty soon where you'll be able  <br>00:39:41.960 to store your data and have a savings uh  <br>00:39:44.800 product capturing the rewards and value  <br>00:39:47.160 from your data um there are already  <br>00:39:49.400 companies on the internet where you can  <br>00:39:50.920 pull all your data together in a  <br>00:39:52.480 community mhm and every time that data  <br>00:39:54.680 is sold you get rewarded every time that  <br>00:39:56.880 data is used us so they could pull that  <br>00:39:58.720 data together and maybe sell it on like  <br>00:40:00.960 an app store or something like that a  <br>00:40:02.280 Marketplace that people would be  <br>00:40:03.280 familiar with they already exist by the  <br>00:40:05.599 by the way ex that like a Cooperative  <br>00:40:07.280 basically exactly exactly that so those  <br>00:40:09.680 exist today there's wallets that exist  <br>00:40:11.280 today there are companies in Saudi  <br>00:40:13.160 Arabia building what I'm describing for  <br>00:40:16.119 health um where people can actually  <br>00:40:17.920 manage their own health data and do that  <br>00:40:20.160 um there are already other companies in  <br>00:40:21.760 web 3 world which allow people to take  <br>00:40:23.680 their data that they store on the  <br>00:40:24.640 internet there's even browsers today  <br>00:40:25.920 like Brave and others that tell you and  <br>00:40:28.160 block advertising if you to look after  <br>00:40:30.319 your data so this is emerging and the  <br>00:40:32.560 biggest move that happened last year  <br>00:40:34.160 which listeners will not know is that  <br>00:40:36.440 Brazil is the first country in the world  <br>00:40:37.960 to allow its citizens to monetize their  <br>00:40:39.520 own data good old Brazil we love Brazil  <br>00:40:42.599 lived in Brazil for a few years there  <br>00:40:44.000 you go why the F Brazil um because they  <br>00:40:47.200 built the technology why if Brazil a  <br>00:40:49.839 developing country as big as it is  <br>00:40:52.040 Amazon covering a big chunk of it why it  <br>00:40:55.800 is crazy so over the last five years I'd  <br>00:40:59.359 say they've gone on a massive  <br>00:41:01.079 digitization Journey um I'm not sure if  <br>00:41:03.760 your listeners will be aware of the Pix  <br>00:41:04.920 network but it's a it's a competitive  <br>00:41:07.079 Network to the traditional payment  <br>00:41:08.680 companies but it's digital so the the  <br>00:41:11.280 fees are a lot cheaper but it makes it  <br>00:41:13.160 more accessible to everyone so they're  <br>00:41:15.079 almost using those digital rails now to  <br>00:41:17.240 eventually push tokens across them so  <br>00:41:19.400 now I've got a digital rail that means I  <br>00:41:20.760 can put any type of payment across it  <br>00:41:22.640 whether it be data whether it be Bitcoin  <br>00:41:24.160 it doesn't really matter um so now  <br>00:41:26.520 they've moved on to this level well  <br>00:41:28.160 actually isn't it time that our citizens  <br>00:41:30.359 got rewarded for how their data is being  <br>00:41:32.200 used um so that was literally written  <br>00:41:34.319 almost written into law last year this  <br>00:41:35.640 year so there's going for consultation  <br>00:41:37.839 and then once that becomes law again  <br>00:41:39.720 that could be a reference point for the  <br>00:41:41.000 rest of the world to say well hang on  <br>00:41:43.680 looks like things are changing and this  <br>00:41:45.160 is why you'll see these companies like  <br>00:41:46.880 even when I started writing my book  <br>00:41:48.720 there was no one it's taking me that  <br>00:41:50.960 long there's like now 30 40 people I  <br>00:41:53.359 meet all over the world I met people  <br>00:41:54.839 last week who are doing blockchain for  <br>00:41:56.920 health care in the United Kingdom MH  <br>00:41:58.920 they're working with patients and  <br>00:42:00.400 they're working with hospitals so they  <br>00:42:02.040 share data with patients and they also  <br>00:42:03.839 make money from that data so this is  <br>00:42:06.280 happening right now um and that's why  <br>00:42:08.760 this is exciting for me  <br>00:42:10.640 because it won't be the monetization  <br>00:42:12.880 that's the exciting bit is the things  <br>00:42:14.160 that we've talked about which is the  <br>00:42:15.520 prevention the ability to create your  <br>00:42:17.640 own mini programs to manage your health  <br>00:42:19.720 to manage your Finance you know talk  <br>00:42:21.680 about utilities that would excite your  <br>00:42:23.240 audience today not many people can  <br>00:42:25.760 understand Financial products mhm um  <br>00:42:28.000 because unfortunately that's a problem  <br>00:42:29.480 for the banking system because they just  <br>00:42:31.280 push their products to customers and  <br>00:42:32.640 hope they understand U not all banks do  <br>00:42:35.040 that but when you on your own data and  <br>00:42:37.359 you have an AI all of a sudden now that  <br>00:42:39.400 will then tailor what it tells you based  <br>00:42:41.079 on your level of understanding and  <br>00:42:42.720 learning so imagine hold on a minute  <br>00:42:44.720 let's just let's do that another way so  <br>00:42:46.760 everyone can get that because that's big  <br>00:42:48.520 yeah say that again so imagine today I  <br>00:42:51.960 have a mortgage and I'm given a leaflet  <br>00:42:54.599 that explains the mortgage to me uhuh  <br>00:42:56.680 everybody's understand that differently  <br>00:42:58.119 based on their literacy level yeah some  <br>00:43:00.000 people just won't get it yeah but what  <br>00:43:02.040 if your AI knew your educational history  <br>00:43:05.760 all your experience all your data and  <br>00:43:08.319 then suddenly interpreted that mortgage  <br>00:43:10.119 into a way that you  <br>00:43:14.839 understood that's the point in all this  <br>00:43:16.800 we have collected a lifetime worth of  <br>00:43:19.000 data and it tells everything about our  <br>00:43:21.440 past it tells us everything who we are  <br>00:43:24.200 but it also tells us who we could become  <br>00:43:26.880 and that's really the power when you  <br>00:43:28.040 start connecting all of this stuff  <br>00:43:30.119 because there is so much we've lost  <br>00:43:33.200 because it's been deleted but there's so  <br>00:43:35.079 much that we could gain because we can't  <br>00:43:36.839 get at it if we could get at it and  <br>00:43:39.440 connect it we could do so much more and  <br>00:43:42.280 what is making this conversation  <br>00:43:44.079 possible today is because the irony is  <br>00:43:46.599 all these technologies have come  <br>00:43:47.920 together at the same time and our  <br>00:43:49.880 maturity as a population of acceptance  <br>00:43:52.200 of technology is a lot higher than it  <br>00:43:53.760 was talk to me about the bit being  <br>00:43:56.599 deleted data being lost that will um I  <br>00:43:59.920 me I there was a guy in the office that  <br>00:44:01.440 came to me the other day and he said  <br>00:44:02.480 I've just got myself a new phone he said  <br>00:44:03.880 I've just lost 20 years of WhatsApp  <br>00:44:05.480 messages I'm like I'm not sure you had  <br>00:44:06.839 WhatsApp for 20 years but nonetheless  <br>00:44:08.520 said he said I said and he's got one  <br>00:44:10.480 Samsung phone to another I said well  <br>00:44:11.839 you've got your Samsung account you can  <br>00:44:13.200 find it no it's gone it's gone it's gone  <br>00:44:15.960 and I was like well you know what that  <br>00:44:17.160 might be a fresh  <br>00:44:18.760 start cuz if you got 20 years of  <br>00:44:20.880 messages on your phone then what kind of  <br>00:44:22.880 a life are you living but that aside he  <br>00:44:26.160 he then said to me but you don't realize  <br>00:44:28.000 he said there's all kinds of clients and  <br>00:44:30.720 leads and opportunities and Business  <br>00:44:32.760 Development chances that now I've lost  <br>00:44:34.880 and I won't be able to remember so  <br>00:44:37.400 that's that's that's that's a normal guy  <br>00:44:39.240 losing his data on his WhatsApp give me  <br>00:44:41.480 give me your explanation  <br>00:44:43.800 so he's correct obviously his timeline's  <br>00:44:46.440 not quite accurate um but he is correct  <br>00:44:49.960 so but the important thing that people  <br>00:44:51.520 need to realize is data is now a  <br>00:44:52.839 cultural artifact as well it's a record  <br>00:44:55.680 of who we were um 14 million people year  <br>00:44:58.400 ago to the pyramids of Egypt yeah right  <br>00:45:00.520 there's a reason for that because  <br>00:45:01.720 they're trying to understand the stories  <br>00:45:02.920 of the past that's where they go um data  <br>00:45:06.720 now has become a cultural artifact but  <br>00:45:08.480 we don't treat it as such so from 1991  <br>00:45:11.359 to 1995 the internet was never archived  <br>00:45:14.359 there's very little record of the  <br>00:45:15.880 internet from 1991 to 1995 okay 2009 and  <br>00:45:20.079 I we're showing our age right 2009 to  <br>00:45:22.160 2018 was the year of the geoc Cities the  <br>00:45:24.800 Myspace these big dominant um websites  <br>00:45:27.920 right where people used to write their  <br>00:45:29.079 music put their you know a lot of  <br>00:45:30.920 artists were discovered on my St B right  <br>00:45:33.599 um and you also got songs music stories  <br>00:45:36.200 everything blogs um all  <br>00:45:38.440 deleted on mypace Geo CI doesn't exist  <br>00:45:41.359 anymore it's been deleted Gio Ci's gone  <br>00:45:43.880 Myspace gone every piece of information  <br>00:45:47.599 that was on there downloaded uploaded  <br>00:45:49.280 Sorry by everybody je cities was wiped  <br>00:45:51.559 35 million users were gone so if you add  <br>00:45:55.359 up all of the websites that were deleted  <br>00:45:57.520 between 2009 and 2018 just to bring this  <br>00:46:00.559 to life for your audience that's the  <br>00:46:02.480 equivalent of me standing in front of  <br>00:46:03.839 the New York library and hitting delete  <br>00:46:05.119 and wiping it off the face of the earth  <br>00:46:07.480 that is half the Vatican archives being  <br>00:46:09.640 deleted that's what that means during  <br>00:46:12.480 covid the my understanding is that the  <br>00:46:15.480 British Museum and archives struggled to  <br>00:46:17.400 piece Co  <br>00:46:18.640 together because our data is constantly  <br>00:46:21.000 being deleted because it's not in our  <br>00:46:23.079 control um and also let's go back to  <br>00:46:26.240 WhatsApp as well  <br>00:46:27.839 let to make your audience think a little  <br>00:46:29.119 bit so I'm going to show My Age Again um  <br>00:46:31.720 again this demonstrates our lack of  <br>00:46:32.920 can't sit in my studio I know I'm you  <br>00:46:35.040 like you do shave like you're in a  <br>00:46:37.640 bloody boy bad talk to people about your  <br>00:46:39.720 age I know you're about 25 just want to  <br>00:46:42.359 shave um right so let's talk about this  <br>00:46:45.720 so if I talk about um if where we going  <br>00:46:49.040 with this so there's the cultural  <br>00:46:50.760 component yeah and then there's also was  <br>00:46:53.359 what was I saying WhatsApp WhatsApp yeah  <br>00:46:54.839 let's go back to WhatsApp so when we  <br>00:46:56.359 think of WhatsApp today let's go back to  <br>00:46:58.319 maybe I think it was the early 2000s  <br>00:47:00.280 Rupert Murdo tried to buy  <br>00:47:02.079 Sky he was told no he went through the  <br>00:47:05.119 competition Authority they said you  <br>00:47:06.400 can't do this because you will have the  <br>00:47:07.520 Monopoly on news Fair many years later  <br>00:47:11.880 Facebook buys WhatsApp and Instagram my  <br>00:47:14.400 argument is it's the same thing they now  <br>00:47:16.720 control the news and they control  <br>00:47:18.240 communication this is a a  <br>00:47:20.359 misunderstanding of not only the  <br>00:47:21.880 cultural example I give in terms of well  <br>00:47:24.040 we don't really understand the think of  <br>00:47:25.160 data as culture MH we also don't think  <br>00:47:27.440 of data and the companies that manage it  <br>00:47:29.319 as a form of communication and news so  <br>00:47:31.599 it's also a regulatory Gap when so the  <br>00:47:34.640 lot of the laws that exist today around  <br>00:47:36.559 merges and Acquisitions and competition  <br>00:47:38.680 they don't actually look at why these  <br>00:47:40.559 companies are buying these technology  <br>00:47:42.880 companies today they're not buying them  <br>00:47:44.680 for other than yes the technology but  <br>00:47:47.240 also the data that they can generate and  <br>00:47:48.920 they have so we are missing a lot of  <br>00:47:52.400 things that are on the surface not  <br>00:47:54.240 obvious so there's the data C culture  <br>00:47:56.680 there's there's the data merger and  <br>00:47:57.839 acquisition there's the data utilization  <br>00:48:00.440 we don't see all of these things have  <br>00:48:02.280 been going on for decades it's just the  <br>00:48:04.480 fact that AI has exposed them to us is  <br>00:48:06.920 there many people like you out there  <br>00:48:08.559 that are really excited about this  <br>00:48:10.400 subject matter that you spend time with  <br>00:48:12.559 talking to or is it or is it still very  <br>00:48:17.280 very early no it's so it's interesting  <br>00:48:20.119 it's almost like you bump into people  <br>00:48:22.280 like the universe wants you to meet them  <br>00:48:24.319 so I I I tend to bump into people at  <br>00:48:26.359 event saw through the network so I met  <br>00:48:30.040 the guy from the data wallet through a  <br>00:48:31.440 well-known person and you know he was  <br>00:48:33.599 like me to my brother right he was  <br>00:48:34.839 literally not only talking about a piece  <br>00:48:36.960 of what I'm talking about like he was  <br>00:48:38.200 building it and he could show me bits of  <br>00:48:40.160 it um and he was involved in the  <br>00:48:41.960 Brazilian regulation um and then i' met  <br>00:48:44.559 someone recently who's building all the  <br>00:48:45.960 health stuff so the cool thing is I'm  <br>00:48:48.760 meeting lots of people who are building  <br>00:48:51.520 in the book The Puzzle that I'm  <br>00:48:53.880 describing and we're describing is being  <br>00:48:55.640 built um that's exciting bit so now now  <br>00:48:59.240 my argument is always the same now we've  <br>00:49:00.720 got the tools we just need the will we  <br>00:49:02.680 need to change the way and that's part  <br>00:49:04.280 of you know what I'm doing and others  <br>00:49:06.040 like me are doing and part of the the  <br>00:49:07.760 work we're doing to help businesses and  <br>00:49:10.000 governments rethink this really  <br>00:49:12.520 important asset that's going to become  <br>00:49:14.680 crucial because there's also the people  <br>00:49:16.880 component in this that I think we' lost  <br>00:49:18.440 as well um which I think they will  <br>00:49:21.000 become even more important with AI Than  <br>00:49:22.599 People realize I think particularly with  <br>00:49:23.960 data interesting now your book is out  <br>00:49:27.119 when so this te is taking longer than I  <br>00:49:29.440 thought and that's cuz the world doesn't  <br>00:49:31.359 stop so 2025 so early 2025 is the plan  <br>00:49:35.079 and the name of the book uh data  <br>00:49:36.520 Revolution the rise of an asset data  <br>00:49:38.920 Revolution the rise of an asset will you  <br>00:49:40.480 do it for us in audio form as well for  <br>00:49:42.480 people that 100% um So the plan is to do  <br>00:49:45.000 two things actually so the first part of  <br>00:49:46.440 the book is a voice for a generation to  <br>00:49:48.799 demand change is to show them what data  <br>00:49:51.599 is and what it became and how it changed  <br>00:49:53.440 and what we Mis outed on but also what  <br>00:49:55.240 could be um this is not sad story um and  <br>00:49:58.359 then we show them the model to make this  <br>00:50:00.119 work so you've asked all the right  <br>00:50:02.079 questions today um and that's why I  <br>00:50:04.200 didn't want to leave people hanging and  <br>00:50:05.799 go well okay this is a great book about  <br>00:50:07.240 history what does this mean because I  <br>00:50:08.440 think the talking is over we need  <br>00:50:09.760 direction now so the second part of the  <br>00:50:11.760 book is the guide book on how to do it  <br>00:50:13.680 so the regulation the model that makes  <br>00:50:15.440 it work all the things that you've asked  <br>00:50:17.000 me about today will be in there even new  <br>00:50:19.079 curriculums for school even the way the  <br>00:50:21.079 businesses need to think about hiring  <br>00:50:22.440 people and all the skills that they're  <br>00:50:23.680 going to be needing to make all of this  <br>00:50:25.359 work if you if you if you've got kids at  <br>00:50:27.799 school and they're seven or eight years  <br>00:50:30.160 old this this is essentially essentially  <br>00:50:33.720 this is essential as a subject matter  <br>00:50:35.760 for them to learn oh 100% because I I  <br>00:50:38.160 think it's a combination of data and AI  <br>00:50:40.559 so we're seeing a lot of conversation  <br>00:50:43.160 around curriculums for AI and teaching  <br>00:50:45.359 kids I'm seeing nothing about data and I  <br>00:50:47.880 think the two go hand inand um I will  <br>00:50:50.799 guarantee something in in three four  <br>00:50:52.319 years time the skills and experiences  <br>00:50:54.720 that people bring to a business or  <br>00:50:56.160 people have in their own life will  <br>00:50:58.040 become incredibly valuable to businesses  <br>00:50:59.760 to the point where and I'll show in the  <br>00:51:01.160 book how you can start valuing people's  <br>00:51:03.119 skills because it's those skills are  <br>00:51:05.319 going to be important to read what AI  <br>00:51:07.599 says but also give the data that AI  <br>00:51:10.040 needs because they're going to come from  <br>00:51:11.680 people right absolutely okay three tips  <br>00:51:14.960 you can give the man on the street  <br>00:51:17.319 related to his data that he can sit and  <br>00:51:20.720 and be highly aware of now and get him  <br>00:51:23.280 into a really conscious state so I think  <br>00:51:25.440 the first thing is have a think about  <br>00:51:28.160 how much data you use every day and what  <br>00:51:30.200 do you use it for and second is who are  <br>00:51:32.599 you giving that data away to and are  <br>00:51:35.240 there ways that you can maybe stop that  <br>00:51:37.280 because there are tools on apps that  <br>00:51:38.400 allow you to do it um and there's also  <br>00:51:40.480 other technologies that you can find on  <br>00:51:41.920 the web that may help you get the most  <br>00:51:43.119 from it I think the third thing is the  <br>00:51:45.400 most important is start thinking about  <br>00:51:47.720 how you can use that data in your own  <br>00:51:49.160 life to make it better um like I work  <br>00:51:52.119 with my PT constantly and we're using  <br>00:51:53.880 data to improve my performance or even  <br>00:51:56.599 just simple things like I use data to  <br>00:51:57.960 cure my own health um so start looking  <br>00:52:01.480 at these things as tools so you know be  <br>00:52:04.200 careful who you give it to understand  <br>00:52:05.520 what you're giving but more importantly  <br>00:52:07.119 start to build an understanding how you  <br>00:52:08.559 can use it for yourself in ways other  <br>00:52:10.640 than just making money and I guess  <br>00:52:12.240 there's a fourth one which is look  <br>00:52:13.960 beyond the technology and don't be  <br>00:52:15.359 afraid about AI because actually once  <br>00:52:17.640 you start understanding your data and  <br>00:52:19.119 you can actually understand how to read  <br>00:52:20.359 it AI starts to become really useful  <br>00:52:22.359 then because it's not really about then  <br>00:52:24.040 as taking their jobs it's about working  <br>00:52:25.880 with AI  <br>00:52:27.160 to understand these predictive things  <br>00:52:28.880 that we've been talking about incredibly  <br>00:52:31.040 value Michael God thank you enough for  <br>00:52:33.160 coming and sharing this wisdom with us  <br>00:52:34.680 today it's been fantastic talking to you  <br>00:52:36.319 thank you so much for joining us no  <br>00:52:37.640 thanks for having me it's been amazing|## SUMMARY  <br>Futurist Michael Clark discusses personal data ownership, the impact of data usage, and the need for new regulations.  <br>  <br>## IDEAS:  <br>- Data ownership empowers individuals to control their personal information and benefit from it.  <br>- Social media companies profit from user data without compensating individuals for their contributions.  <br>- The average attention span has decreased to eight seconds, affecting data literacy.  <br>- Data can be seen as personal stories and memories that should be owned by individuals.  <br>- Blockchain technology could enable decentralized ownership and control of personal data.  <br>- AI and data can work together to create personalized health insights and improve well-being.  <br>- Data serves as a cultural artifact, preserving history and personal narratives.  <br>- The Brazilian government is the first to allow citizens to monetize their personal data.  <br>- A data bond could reward individuals for sharing their personal data with governments and companies.  <br>- Data is increasingly vital to daily life, comparable to essential resources like water.  <br>- Companies are currently using data without transparency, leading to privacy concerns for individuals.  <br>- Individuals can utilize their health data to enhance their fitness and wellness.  <br>- The concept of data as an asset requires a shift in mindset and regulation.  <br>- People need to be educated on how to interpret and use their personal data effectively.  <br>- The use of personal data for AI development should also benefit the data owners.  <br>- The future of data ownership will lead to innovation and new economic opportunities.  <br>  <br>## INSIGHTS:  <br>- Ownership of personal data is crucial for empowerment and protecting individual privacy.  <br>- Data literacy is becoming increasingly important in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.  <br>- Blockchain can provide secure and transparent means of managing and trading personal data.  <br>- AI can offer personalized health advice based on comprehensive data collected from individuals.  <br>- The future economy will hinge on individuals understanding and leveraging their personal data.  <br>- Data should be treated like a utility that can be both monetized and utilized for personal growth.  <br>- Regulations must evolve to recognize and protect individual ownership of personal data.  <br>- Collaborative AI can improve life by interpreting data in a way that makes it actionable.  <br>- Individuals' unique experiences can guide AI in providing tailored health and lifestyle

Like seriously,  <br>00:00:05.460 while my team and I were gone for threeweeks working on a top secret project  <br>00:00:08.670 for a pretty big YouTuber .  <br>00:00:10.710 I was just telling everyone how Nick waslazy and didn't finish his edit before  <br>00:00:14.460 the trip. Oh yeah, I only stayed up.  <br>00:00:17.010 Till one. I can't tell you about it.Don't even ask me. I'll tell you later.  <br>00:00:19.590 We needed a secure wicked fasts wayto access all of our stuff back home.  <br>00:00:23.550 Things like my big fat NASS remote desktopinto our editing machines and even my  <br>00:00:27.450 home lab to watch some flex. That'skind of what VPN is for, right? I mean,  <br>00:00:30.900 sure I could have set it up,but I didn't have the time.  <br>00:00:32.910 And the solution I found took about fiveminutes. And this one might shock you.  <br>00:00:36.270 VPN is not secure enough.  <br>00:00:37.600 Like when I give my twoknucklehead editors VP in access,  <br>00:00:40.800 they get access to everything serversthey shouldn't touch and they have a nasty  <br>00:00:44.160 habit of downloading free ramp.  <br>00:00:45.600 And if they already have malware and theycan blast it out to my entire network,  <br>00:00:49.050 what I need is a solution that givesthem access to only stuff they need.  <br>00:00:52.530 Nothing else.  <br>00:00:53.400 This is a little technique calledzero trust because I zero trust them.  <br>00:00:57.300 And listen, it's not just security aftersome research, VPN is kind of the uh,  <br>00:01:02.730 kind of the old way of doingthings and old as lane. I mean,  <br>00:01:07.565 have you seen the new stuff? It's [crazy.So](http://crazy.so/) what I found, it's kind of amazing.  <br>00:01:12.180 It's called Twin Gate. It's a zerotrust, remote access solution, buzzwords,  <br>00:01:15.630 blah blah blah. It basically means magicand it checks all my boxes. Watch this.  <br>00:01:20.010 In about five minutes,I deploy the Twin Gate,  <br>00:01:22.050 Docker container to my studionetwork, my home lab network,  <br>00:01:25.230 and even some private networksin the cloud. And just like that,  <br>00:01:28.200 I can connect from anywhere no matterwhere I go, no firewall config,  <br>00:01:31.950 no port forwarding and just works.  <br>00:01:33.660 And I don't care if you have CGNat or some weird I S P issues.  <br>00:01:37.830 It just does its thing kindof scary, easy actually.  <br>00:01:40.650 I have granular control on whateach person on my team can access.  <br>00:01:44.370 I can even say, you could only accessthis machine on this port and that's it.  <br>00:01:48.060 I can even control what they'reallowed to access stuff with.  <br>00:01:50.646 Like I could say they can use iPhonesbut no Android and that just makes sense.  <br>00:01:54.570 And if they're using Windows, I canrequire antivirus firewall settings.  <br>00:01:58.230 And if they don't have 'em, theycan't connect. And the crazy part,  <br>00:02:01.110 this is free, free for up to fiveusers and that covers my business.  <br>00:02:05.010 So let's get this set upin your network right now.  <br>00:02:07.560 I'll walk you throughevery step. It'll be quick,  <br>00:02:09.580 no longer than it taste tobrew a cup of coffee, trust me.  <br>00:02:12.150 And speaking of coffee,go ahead and do that.  <br>00:02:13.800 Grab you some because everythingin it requires coffee.  <br>00:02:19.440 Also,  <br>00:02:19.860 shout out to Twin Gate for helping mesolve my remote access problems and for  <br>00:02:23.100 sponsoring this video.  <br>00:02:24.210 Now I'm pretty picky about sponsorsand Twin Gate makes the cut. I love it.  <br>00:02:27.660 It's something I actuallyuse for everything and Iknow this will provide a ton  <br>00:02:31.290 of value to you. So let's get intoit. Actually, you know, real quick,  <br>00:02:34.350 have you hacked theYouTube algorithm today?  <br>00:02:36.390 Let's make sure you do hit thatlike button notification bell.  <br>00:02:38.220 Come and subscribe to everything. Yes,you gotta hack YouTube today ethically,  <br>00:02:43.260 of course. Now here's the setup.We have our network for me,  <br>00:02:45.990 it's my studio for you, it mightbe your home lab or your business.  <br>00:02:48.720 The goal here is to get my knuckleheadeditors access to what they need inside  <br>00:02:53.040 my network. So Income's TwinGate. Twin Gate has four parts.  <br>00:02:56.640 And don't let that scare you. You'llhave to worry about two of 'em.  <br>00:02:58.800 I'm telling you, this is not complex, atleast the setup. We've got our client,  <br>00:03:02.200 our connector, ourcontroller, and our relay.  <br>00:03:05.350 Right now we're gonna focus onthe connector and the controller.  <br>00:03:08.020 The controller is managed byTwin Gate. It's in their cloud,  <br>00:03:10.630 and it's what we'll use to sign up fora free account and configure all our  <br>00:03:13.395 stuff and who has accessto what the connector is,  <br>00:03:15.820 the docker container you'regonna put inside of your network,  <br>00:03:18.700 behind your firewall.  <br>00:03:19.810 And all you have to know about theconnector is that it connects stuff.  <br>00:03:22.750 That's all you have to know.  <br>00:03:23.560 I think that's the only twosteps we have to worry about.  <br>00:03:25.660 Set up an account on TwinGate, which is the controller,  <br>00:03:28.270 and then deploy the connectorinside our network. Done.  <br>00:03:32.140 Now that does beg the question, whatdo we need for this? Only two things.  <br>00:03:35.800 First, you'll need something to put thatDocker container on some type of Lennox  <br>00:03:40.510 server. This could be your nas, anold laptop, even a raspberry pie,  <br>00:03:44.110 which is what I'm goingto demo on right now.  <br>00:03:46.000 And the second thing you shouldalready have in your hand right now,  <br>00:03:48.430 a cup of coffee. Like I said, everythingin it requires coffee. Say it with me,  <br>00:03:52.240 I'm not gonna do it again, butseriously, get some coffee.  <br>00:03:54.430 First step is the controller. So headout to twin [gates.com](http://gates.com/). That's simple.  <br>00:03:58.330 That's it. It's time toditch your vpn. Dang right.  <br>00:04:00.550 And right here in the middle, we'regonna click on try Twin Gate for free.  <br>00:04:03.520 Try twin gate, try twin gates. Say that10 times fast. That's ridiculously hard.  <br>00:04:07.000 Click it here. Pick your poison.What do you wanna log in with?  <br>00:04:09.940 I'm gonna log in with GitHub,click on that authorize twin gate.  <br>00:04:13.060 And here we have some details.Now if you're like, okay,  <br>00:04:15.760 I'm setting this up for my home lab, Idon't have a company name, don't worry,  <br>00:04:18.910 they're gonna give you a business trialfor 14 days, no credit card, whatever.  <br>00:04:22.000 You're gonna have that starter plan forfree forever. So make up a company name.  <br>00:04:25.600 I'm gonna name my own hack, well technumber of employees under a hundred.  <br>00:04:29.350 Let's finish it up. Skip allthis, blah, blah, blah. No,  <br>00:04:32.050 I don't need technical support. I'm good.I can run C commands, I promise I can.  <br>00:04:35.260 And then choose your url. I'llleave it at Hack Wall Tech.  <br>00:04:37.750 Good to go create that network. So atthis point you have a twin Gate account,  <br>00:04:41.380 you have a controller. Now all wehave to do is configure a few things.  <br>00:04:44.590 There are two thingswe're gonna start with,  <br>00:04:46.000 and it's actually tellingyou right here at step one,  <br>00:04:48.070 the first thing we'll setup is your remote network,  <br>00:04:49.490 which will be your home lab,studio, business, whatever.  <br>00:04:52.810 And once we defined it here,  <br>00:04:53.980 we can actually deploy ourconnector to connect everything up.  <br>00:04:57.790 The second thing will configureresources. By default,  <br>00:05:00.370 you can't access anything.  <br>00:05:01.480 So you have to specifically explicitlydefine what you are allowed to access in  <br>00:05:06.370 your network. I love that. Zerotrust. All right, let's go.  <br>00:05:09.340 Let's knock out the network first.  <br>00:05:10.990 You'll notice right down here we have adda remote network. Let's click on that.  <br>00:05:15.100 Choose your location. Noticeyou have some options.  <br>00:05:17.560 What I care about right now ison-premise, and I'll name it Hack well  <br>00:05:23.980 hq, add Remote Network. Man, that wasso hard, right? , that was easy.  <br>00:05:27.240 And we're almost done actually. Now todeploy our connector inside the network.  <br>00:05:31.240 Notice they have two connectorsover here, but they're not deployed.  <br>00:05:34.810 And notice they do want you to deploytwo, you can deploy one, that's fine.  <br>00:05:38.230 But if you want redundancy and highavailability, you can deploy two.  <br>00:05:41.290 But we'll start with one, butwhich one to pick? Impetuous,  <br>00:05:44.290 jagar or Optimal Vulture. Ican pronounce this better.  <br>00:05:48.130 I'm gonna go with that one.  <br>00:05:48.910 So we'll click on deploy connector andwe'll choose how we're going to deploy  <br>00:05:51.910 this. Now, I talked about this Docker,  <br>00:05:54.070 docker's so easy we're gonna go withthat, but you do have options. Step,  <br>00:05:57.350 we're gonna generate ourtokens. What are those?  <br>00:05:59.930 We'll cover more about thathere in a bit. In fact,  <br>00:06:01.880 I'm gonna go kind of nerdy on you andexplain the magic of how this works.  <br>00:06:05.540 But let's set this up. First. We'llgo ahead and generate our tokens.  <br>00:06:08.120 Click on generate tokens, and it willask you to authenticate yourself again,  <br>00:06:11.480 which is great security.  <br>00:06:13.040 And you'll notice you do have youraccess and refresh tokens generated.  <br>00:06:16.280 And then we'll scrollon down to step four.  <br>00:06:18.710 And all we have to do here is copy andpaste this Docker run command and we're  <br>00:06:22.585 good to go. So I'll pause here for asecond. Let's get logged into the device.  <br>00:06:25.610 We're going to install our twin gateconnector on. For me it's a raspberry pie.  <br>00:06:29.810 So here in Windows I'm gonna launch myterminal and I'll ssh into my raspberry  <br>00:06:33.320 pie. And before we copyand paste our command,  <br>00:06:35.660 let's just make sure we have Dockerinstalled, and that's super easy. First,  <br>00:06:38.630 we'll update our repositories,pseudo p t update,  <br>00:06:41.870 and then we'll install Dockerpseudo apt install [docker.io](http://docker.io/)  <br>00:06:46.760 dash y. Mine is already installed,but it should go pretty quick for you.  <br>00:06:49.910 And now literally all wehave to do is copy and paste.  <br>00:06:53.330 So we'll get back to our browserhere, click the copy command,  <br>00:06:56.000 go back to our terminal and paste. Andyou may have to run this as pseudo.  <br>00:06:59.840 I wanna do a control A,  <br>00:07:01.250 run it as pseudo at the beginning andthen hit enter and let the party start.  <br>00:07:05.600 Who, ah, I love seeing this quickcoffee break while the show's happening.  <br>00:07:08.870 Just enjoy the show.  <br>00:07:12.770 And that was it. So real quickwhile we're here on the terminal,  <br>00:07:16.220 before we leave, let's type inpseudo docker PS to make sure it's,  <br>00:07:20.780 it's in there running. Andthere it is, it's running.  <br>00:07:22.670 And now if we get back to ourtwinge controller, aka [twinge.com](http://twinge.com/),  <br>00:07:27.290 there it is. Our connection status,the optimal vulture is connected.  <br>00:07:31.400 Now let's add some resources. Let'sget back to our network up here.  <br>00:07:34.790 Click on that. And we don'treally need this right now.  <br>00:07:36.710 So let's just click on dismiss.  <br>00:07:38.030 And right here you'll seean add resource button.  <br>00:07:40.250 Let's click on that Add resource.  <br>00:07:41.840 The first thing we'll dois choose a remote network.  <br>00:07:43.760 I'm gonna pick Hack well hq. And yes,  <br>00:07:45.830 that does mean you can havemore than one remote network.  <br>00:07:47.740 So add your parents' house at grandma'shouse, your friend's house, whatever.  <br>00:07:51.080 You can do that. Then we'll specify ourhost. Now we can use DNS or IP address.  <br>00:07:55.160 And this DNS thing, by the way, is crazy.  <br>00:07:57.740 We'll cover that here in a bit for now.  <br>00:07:59.270 We'll focus on IP addressto keep things simple.  <br>00:08:01.190 So choose cider label what you'resetting up. I'm gonna access my nas.  <br>00:08:04.220 First big fat nas. Then the IP address.  <br>00:08:08.780 Keep in mind, this will beyour private IP address aside,  <br>00:08:11.300 your home network or yourbusiness network, whatever it is.  <br>00:08:14.120 Then also notice we have an alias option.  <br>00:08:16.430 We'll cover that when we talk about dns.But again, this whole thing is insane.  <br>00:08:20.120 It's magic. I can't wait to tellyou that though. But let, let's,  <br>00:08:22.310 let's keep moving forward. Nextwe have protocol restrictions.  <br>00:08:24.740 And what I wanna do is have myeditors only access my NASS on Port  <br>00:08:29.240 5,000, which is the gooey. So Iclick on protocol restrictions.  <br>00:08:33.169 Right now everything'sallowed, may not want that.  <br>00:08:35.539 So we'll say TCP restrict and we'llspecify the ports. I'll say 5,000.  <br>00:08:40.220 And then I'll block UDP andblock I C M P. So at this point,  <br>00:08:44.930 only port 5,000 TCP is allowed.That's all we care about right now.  <br>00:08:49.100 I'm gonna click on ad resource.And then as soon as you do that,  <br>00:08:51.475 you can choose who has access to thisresource for now we have one group.  <br>00:08:55.050 That's everyone. I'll go ahead and addthat. We can change that at any time.  <br>00:08:58.950 And I'll click on add one [group.So](http://group.so/) right now we have a resource.  <br>00:09:01.800 If I hover over this guy right here,  <br>00:09:03.540 it'll tell me exactly what'sallowed TCP 5,000. That's it.  <br>00:09:06.660 So what do you say we tested out? Whichby the way, you just set up Twin Gate,  <br>00:09:09.990 like that was it. That's all it took.Now we have to worry about is the client.  <br>00:09:13.290 The third piece,  <br>00:09:14.670 which is just installing an appand logging in super hard .  <br>00:09:18.480 Let's try that right now. Allright, I got my laptop here.  <br>00:09:20.670 I wanna download the Twin Gate clientby heading out to twin [gate.com/download](http://gate.com/download)  <br>00:09:25.050 cuz I'm using Windows. I'llclick on download for Windows.  <br>00:09:27.450 They have an app for everything. Mac, goWest, iPhone, Android, whatever. It's,  <br>00:09:30.630 I'll open the file and install thesucker and click on finish. Ugh.  <br>00:09:34.440 And a restart. I hate restartingthis stuff. One moment. Now,  <br>00:09:37.020 before I configure TwinGate, like any good magician,  <br>00:09:39.480 let me show you that I can'taccess my stuff. First.  <br>00:09:42.150 I want to make sure I'm connectedto my 5G connection on my phone.  <br>00:09:45.395 Now let's try and access my NASSfour, 5,000. It's not looking good.  <br>00:09:49.080 Can't reach the page. Nowlet's sign into twinge.  <br>00:09:51.270 I'll connect to Hack Well Tech, that'swhen I named it, right? Yeah, I think so.  <br>00:09:55.140 I'll join that network, sign in withmy GitHub and we should be good to go.  <br>00:09:59.580 I'm gonna close my browser windowreal quick. It already happened.  <br>00:10:02.610 Look at that 5,000. I'm going over it,man. Look at my tray right now. Yes,  <br>00:10:07.350 I can see I'm connected.Oh, that's so stinking cool.  <br>00:10:09.990 I love this but I shouldn't be ableto ping anything. Let's see. Yeah,  <br>00:10:13.800 nothing campaign it. We disabledIC m p, let's try S ssh. Nothing.  <br>00:10:17.880 Let me nail it real quick.Actually, I wanna test this.  <br>00:10:19.890 Now we're rolling then I'm gonnajust edit it real quick and add  <br>00:10:24.690 port 22. Let's see what happens.Confirm changes. Let's try it now. Oh,  <br>00:10:29.280 took a minute, but I'm in justlike that. How cool is that?  <br>00:10:32.490 Now at this point you've configuredTwin Gate, like it works, it's amazing.  <br>00:10:35.670 But there's more we can do. There'sDNS based routing, device security,  <br>00:10:39.270 and we're gonna walk through all thathere in a moment. But if you're like me,  <br>00:10:42.090 kind of a nerd, you can't just walkaway from this video thinking, okay,  <br>00:10:45.060 I've got the fastest, most secureway to connect to my stuff.  <br>00:10:47.670 But you have to know how it works,right? Like how is this thing working?  <br>00:10:50.760 Let's talk about that Nowlet's get a bit nerdy.  <br>00:10:52.980 Let's pop the hood on thisthing and see what's going on.  <br>00:10:54.960 What's the magic that's makingall this tick? And it's,  <br>00:10:57.120 it's actually really cool. Ican't wait to show you now.  <br>00:10:58.980 I'll start with this Twin gate. It's,it's not a p n, it's not .  <br>00:11:02.460 Let me explain Now, the goal forTwin Gate is this right here,  <br>00:11:05.160 a secure end-to-end TLS tunnel. It'speer-to-peer between the client,  <br>00:11:09.330 which is you or your family oryour employees, friends, whatever,  <br>00:11:12.390 and the connector inside yournetwork. But how does this happen?  <br>00:11:15.450 Especially with networksthat don't play nice.  <br>00:11:17.250 They have like CG Nat Dynamic IP addressesand all the craziness our ISPs put us  <br>00:11:21.425 through. Because trust me, if youhave those networks, this thing just,  <br>00:11:24.120 it just works. But how,  <br>00:11:25.950 let's start with the connectorcuz he does most of the work.  <br>00:11:28.110 The connector is this guy.  <br>00:11:29.040 Let's talk about how theconnector was born real quick.  <br>00:11:30.870 So you may recall in our controller here,  <br>00:11:32.700 we deploy the connector inside thecontroller, the optimal vulture.  <br>00:11:35.790 When we did that, we had to generatea couple of tokens like, like this.  <br>00:11:39.030 If I try to deploy anotherconnector, I'll say generate tokens,  <br>00:11:41.640 have to authenticateagain. And there they are.  <br>00:11:43.470 I point this out because this isa key part of Twin Gate security.  <br>00:11:47.010 They use more tokens than Chuck E Cheeseand that's how they authenticate with  <br>00:11:49.950 each other.  <br>00:11:50.400 So when we deploy this docker runcommand baked in with these Chucky cheese  <br>00:11:54.460 tokens and when the twin Gateconnector came up in our network,  <br>00:11:57.280 he talked to the controller and said,Hey, here I am. Here's my tokens.  <br>00:12:00.460 And they, they were friendsnow cuz he knew who he was.  <br>00:12:02.890 So he gives him thetokens and then exchange.  <br>00:12:04.660 The controller tells a connectoreverything he needs to know.  <br>00:12:07.420 Two really important thingswe're gonna focus on right now.  <br>00:12:09.570 First is an ACL and access control list.  <br>00:12:12.460 This tells the connector who'sallowed to come into the network.  <br>00:12:14.830 It's a list of allowed devices andwhat they're allowed to access.  <br>00:12:17.320 We define that. Remember wedid that inside the controller.  <br>00:12:19.660 So the controller's givingthe connector that list,  <br>00:12:21.940 he's also telling him about Mr. Relay.  <br>00:12:24.370 Remember Twin Gate has four componentsand this is the fourth one we have not  <br>00:12:27.490 talked about yet. So thecontroller says, Hey,  <br>00:12:28.936 here's a few relays that youcan connect to. Now the relays,  <br>00:12:32.170 I'll tell you more about whatthose are here in a moment.  <br>00:12:33.790 Much like the controller,  <br>00:12:34.630 they're hosted inside Twin Gates networkso you don't have to worry about it.  <br>00:12:37.870 I'll put the relaysright here in my beard.  <br>00:12:40.150 Now the relay's job is simple butsuper important. He's the matchmaker.  <br>00:12:43.960 He helps the client,  <br>00:12:45.010 my knucklehead video editors andthe connector discovery each other,  <br>00:12:48.340 find out how to meet. He'sthe guy that does that.  <br>00:12:50.710 The kind of play in love is blind rightnow they're talking behind a wall.  <br>00:12:53.530 Let's take down that wall.  <br>00:12:57.040 Just a hug.  <br>00:12:58.140 Now here's how the clientand the connector connect.  <br>00:13:00.670 The first thing that'll happenis the connector will connect.  <br>00:13:03.430 He's such a connector.  <br>00:13:04.720 He'll connect with a relay and he guesseswhat he uses to authenticate a  <br>00:13:08.620 token. It's actually a token from thecontroller to say, Hey, I know this guy,  <br>00:13:13.360 we both know him. We're friends, we'regood. Not on the flip side, the client,  <br>00:13:17.290 it's doing the same thing.  <br>00:13:18.460 It did the whole token thing of thecontroller when it authenticated and it  <br>00:13:21.940 connects to a relay.  <br>00:13:23.200 So now that the client and theconnector are talking to the relay,  <br>00:13:25.810 the relay can now introducethem. He's the matchmaker,  <br>00:13:28.330 but he's doing more than you might thinkcuz there's a pretty big problem he's  <br>00:13:31.065 solving right now. And thisis why we even need a relay.  <br>00:13:33.550 The problem is that the devices in yournetwork are nestled safely behind a  <br>00:13:36.940 firewall or a router and they're somewhatkind of sheltered from the internet.  <br>00:13:40.540 The internet can't touch them. Andthat's by design. That's a good thing.  <br>00:13:42.796 Your devices don't evenhave a public IP address,  <br>00:13:45.160 which is what they need to talkto everyone on the internet.  <br>00:13:47.710 Usually your router is the one that hasthe public IP address and he allows the  <br>00:13:51.645 devices on your network. So thinkyou're nas, your twin gate connector,  <br>00:13:56.050 your editing PCs.  <br>00:13:57.190 He allows those devices to use thepublic IP whenever they want to talk to  <br>00:14:01.090 people. This is a magical technologycalled nat or network address translation.  <br>00:14:05.290 So what this means is thatyour computer, for example,  <br>00:14:07.240 has no problem talking to the internetwhen it tries to go out and talk to a  <br>00:14:10.780 website. The router will letit use its public IP address.  <br>00:14:14.320 It'll actually give it alittle identifier, a port,  <br>00:14:16.870 let's say 5 1 7 90 with that identifierthat port your computer can talk to  <br>00:14:21.880 any website it wants. It works great.  <br>00:14:23.530 And when the website wants to send aphoto back or a meme or whatever you're  <br>00:14:26.530 doing, it knows that this camefrom 1 5, 9, 7 4, 1, 2, 2, 1 1 3,  <br>00:14:31.540 port 51, 7, 9, 0.  <br>00:14:33.880 So when it talks back to yourcomputer and it gets to your router,  <br>00:14:37.570 your router goes, oh, this is 4507 90. When they get that right to 'em.  <br>00:14:41.740 Now Nat and these randomly assigned portsare great for your computer to connect  <br>00:14:45.370 to stuff on the internet,but not great at all.  <br>00:14:47.710 for things to connect back to it.  <br>00:14:49.810 So the Twin Gate client can'tstart talking to your computer.  <br>00:14:52.790 There's no door open there. Andthat's where the relays come in.  <br>00:14:55.430 The relay does something really cleverand it's so cool when you really think  <br>00:14:58.460 about it.  <br>00:14:58.760 So you know the example I gave you ofyour computer connecting to a website and  <br>00:15:02.300 using a randomly assigned port using that.  <br>00:15:04.400 It uses that to build thatpeer-to-peer connection. So watch this,  <br>00:15:07.646 your connector inside your network,it's connected to the relay, right?  <br>00:15:11.300 We've got a connection,  <br>00:15:12.230 which means he's gonna have a public IPand a randomly assigned port from Nat  <br>00:15:16.765 from your router.  <br>00:15:17.570 So IP and port and the relay knowsthat because he has that connection.  <br>00:15:21.230 On the other side of things,you using the Twin Gate client,  <br>00:15:24.410 you're probably using Nat toowifi at Starbucks airport,  <br>00:15:27.350 some secret YouTuberstudio, whatever it is.  <br>00:15:29.750 So you get your public IP and theyrandomly assign port and the client has a  <br>00:15:33.500 connection with the relay. Soright at this moment, look at this,  <br>00:15:36.530 the relay has a connection withthe connector and the client,  <br>00:15:39.710 he knows their public IP addresses andhe knows the port that Nats using to  <br>00:15:43.490 reach back to them. So the relay goes,lemme just tell them where they are.  <br>00:15:48.110 Let me,  <br>00:15:48.290 let me tell both these guys where theyare so they can talk to each other.  <br>00:15:51.080 And that's exactly what happens.The relay tells the client, Hey,  <br>00:15:54.230 if you want to talk to the connector,here's his IP address in port.  <br>00:15:57.140 And he tells the connector, Hey,if you wanna talk to the client,  <br>00:15:59.330 here's his IP address in port. Andwith that magic information supplied,  <br>00:16:03.830 bam, we get a connection.  <br>00:16:05.570 They know how to find each other ina secure end-to-end TLS tunnel is  <br>00:16:10.010 established. Now thismagic does have a name,  <br>00:16:12.440 it's called Nat Traversal because we'retraversing all these NAT servers to make  <br>00:16:17.305 a direct connection,  <br>00:16:18.140 which is pretty hard to do when thingsare kind of hidden behind random ports.  <br>00:16:21.640 That's why we need a server like a relay.  <br>00:16:24.740 This is actually operatingas a stun server.  <br>00:16:26.870 Stun does this kind of stuff and itfacilitates those connections. Whoa,  <br>00:16:30.710 why is there a virus onthis pc? Let me remove that,  <br>00:16:33.680 how embarrassing I left that there.  <br>00:16:35.990 Now a couple of things about howthis connection business works.  <br>00:16:39.320 A couple of highlights. Thisthing is secure. Like I said,  <br>00:16:42.320 twin Gate is using moretokens than Chuck E. Cheese.  <br>00:16:44.510 Every single interaction wasauthenticated with a token.  <br>00:16:47.900 This TLS tunnel is usingpenned certificates,  <br>00:16:50.630 which makes it darn near impossibleto do a man in the middle attack.  <br>00:16:53.540 And honestly, I'm not doing it justice.  <br>00:16:55.070 If you wanna dive deeper into how likeall the authentication and tokenizing  <br>00:16:58.640 stuff is working, I've gottadocument below, check it out.  <br>00:17:01.640 The second thing is that this isnot a VPN n I mentioned it before.  <br>00:17:05.240 So you're probably like, wellChuck, if it's not vpn, what is it?  <br>00:17:07.460 It's a proxy actually.  <br>00:17:08.630 It's a super secure private proxy andspecifically the connector inside your  <br>00:17:12.770 network is operating it as a proxy.  <br>00:17:15.230 They work by terminatingnetwork connections andthey'll do some fancy stuff for  <br>00:17:18.530 that traffic. They'llmanipulate it, validate it,  <br>00:17:20.599 and forward the traffic on to itscorrect destination. It's very,  <br>00:17:23.720 very programmable and and custom. Thethird thing I want you to know is, uh,  <br>00:17:27.380 this sucker's quick and no,  <br>00:17:29.120 I didn't forget how to spell Quick is a new protocol.  <br>00:17:32.060 If you haven't heard of this.  <br>00:17:32.950 It's a transport layer protocol forall your network uh, nerds out there.  <br>00:17:36.230 It's built on top of U udp and it'sdesigned to be faster and more efficient  <br>00:17:40.760 than tcp, which is likewait, you're building on topof UDP to beat TCP ?  <br>00:17:45.500 Sure, but that's what it does. Now,quick is taking the internet by storm.  <br>00:17:49.200 You're probably already using it rightnow if you did a wire shark capture.  <br>00:17:51.540 But here's some of the maindifferences that makes it amazing.  <br>00:17:54.390 One of them is multiplexing.Multiplexing is a big one.  <br>00:17:57.390 You can send multiple streams of dataover one connection versus this rush hour  <br>00:18:01.380 freeway up here that's tcp.  <br>00:18:03.360 And what this means for Twin Gate andwhy it's so quick to make connections is  <br>00:18:06.990 that it can make a connection offand everything in one round trip.  <br>00:18:11.100 Whereas with TCP it might be a bunchof back and forth negotiations and  <br>00:18:15.870 time and remitted packetsand all kinds of stuff.  <br>00:18:18.240 And one really cool thing that quickdoes, and this is kind of mind blowing,  <br>00:18:22.080 but it does client sideroaming or it facilitates that.  <br>00:18:24.690 So let's say you as a client are tryingto remain connected to a remote desktop  <br>00:18:28.080 session or you're watching a movie onPlex and you go from wifi in your house to  <br>00:18:31.560 maybe you're in the car on 5g.  <br>00:18:33.660 Normally that switch and connectionrequires a disconnect and reconnect quick  <br>00:18:37.775 just keeps connection up. Theconnection survives. It's kind of crazy.  <br>00:18:41.280 And then one more thing to note backhaul with traditional V P N when you  <br>00:18:44.700 connect,  <br>00:18:45.300 it normally means every bit of trafficyou're generating whatever website you go  <br>00:18:48.990 to, whether it's on your privatenetwork or on the internet,  <br>00:18:52.230 it's gonna go through that VPN N device.  <br>00:18:55.200 Literally everything you're doingis going through the VPN N device.  <br>00:18:57.810 That's bad for a varietyof reasons. First of all,  <br>00:18:59.375 you may not want to have everythingyou're doing be seen by that VPN N device.  <br>00:19:02.220 All you wanted was accessto some resources. Second,  <br>00:19:04.950 as an IT person is a person tryingto administer a VPN gateway, dude,  <br>00:19:08.310 that's a lot of extra traffic thatyou're having to grow your firewall for.  <br>00:19:12.030 It's really inefficient.  <br>00:19:13.020 But with Twin Gate it does a thingcalled Split tunnel by default,  <br>00:19:16.020 which means that only traffic destinedfor the resources you want access,  <br>00:19:20.430 go through a twin gate, everythingelse, Facebook, YouTube, it goes out.  <br>00:19:23.825 Your standard internet gatewaydoesn't touch twin gay.  <br>00:19:26.310 So only the traffic that needs to goacross those security t l s tunnels,  <br>00:19:30.870 those end-to-end tunnels,  <br>00:19:32.490 the only traffic that goes across thoseis traffic that's supposed to for those  <br>00:19:35.430 resources. Now, yes, you can configureSplit Tunnel with a lot of V P N.  <br>00:19:39.270 I've done it. It's not easy. Twin Gate is built in by default.  <br>00:19:43.590 You don't have to even think aboutit. It just works like that. Okay,  <br>00:19:45.750 we popped the hood, wesaw some nerdy stuff.  <br>00:19:47.760 Now time to configure some nerdy thingsstarting with something really cool.  <br>00:19:51.540 Device security. Now back here in ourtwin gate controller, aka twin [gate.com](http://gate.com/),  <br>00:19:55.830 let's do a few things real quick. First,  <br>00:19:57.570 we're actually gonna add to ourteam by clicking on team up here,  <br>00:20:00.330 adding to your team is real easy. Ifyou wanna add family, friends, whatever,  <br>00:20:03.420 I'll click on add user, I'll addmyself to this team, send invite email.  <br>00:20:07.710 And what I'll also do is configurea group. So I'll click on groups,  <br>00:20:10.440 add a group and say Beards,that's it. Add group.  <br>00:20:13.590 And then I'll jump into that group, clickon users and add myself to that group.  <br>00:20:16.620 Now here I'm connecting on myphone and you can see I'm on 5g.  <br>00:20:19.980 Now I'm connecting through justfine, everything's loading.  <br>00:20:21.930 But now let's play with device security.  <br>00:20:23.520 So at the top I'll click ondevices and first of all,  <br>00:20:25.590 it's pretty cool that you cansee every device connected,  <br>00:20:27.870 but what we care about is securityright here. Let's click on that here.  <br>00:20:30.930 We can configure security based onminimum OS requirements. So for example,  <br>00:20:35.220 I may not want iOS allowed at all.  <br>00:20:38.370 So I can go in here and say Block [iOS.So](http://ios.so/) now when I try to log into Twin Gate,  <br>00:20:43.350 I've got iOS blocked, I can'teven authenticate, I can't get in.  <br>00:20:46.740 So you block an entire OS or just enforcegood policies like hey, screen lock,  <br>00:20:51.340 let's make sure we have screen lockand maybe like biometric configuration.  <br>00:20:54.520 So touch ID if you still have that faceid, things like that. Heck yeah, Linux,  <br>00:20:58.720 HD encryption, firewall, windows,goodness gracious, enable the whole thing.  <br>00:21:02.920 So that's already super powerful. Also,  <br>00:21:04.630 you'll see we have the optionto create a trusted profile.  <br>00:21:07.060 Let me show you what thatis. The click on create.  <br>00:21:09.010 Let's say we'll do one for Windows.  <br>00:21:10.360 Notice here we have theoption to integrate with thirdparty endpoint protection  <br>00:21:14.320 stuff, CrowdStrike, Intune, Sentinel One.  <br>00:21:16.540 And you can rely on those super advancedprograms to tell you if those devices  <br>00:21:19.930 are safe to connect. And ifthey're not trusted by those,  <br>00:21:22.190 then they're not trusted byTwin Gates. That's pretty cool.  <br>00:21:26.020 Now we also have policieswhere you can define policies.  <br>00:21:28.960 The main thing I want you to see inpolicies is the MFA not required.  <br>00:21:31.935 Over here you can just straight offthe bat make sure that MFA multifactor  <br>00:21:35.740 authentication is required.  <br>00:21:37.450 And then going into policies youcan set further requirements.  <br>00:21:40.300 Like if you set the defaultpolicy for device security,  <br>00:21:43.030 you can manage that to say,Hey, only trusted devices,  <br>00:21:45.555 meaning they have to be trustedby CrowdStrike in TuneIn all one.  <br>00:21:49.870 Or you can leave it at any deviceas long as they meet device security  <br>00:21:52.330 requirements, the minimumOS requirements you've set.  <br>00:21:54.580 Now I wanna move on to something prettyfun and it's how Twin Gate handles and  <br>00:21:58.270 treats dns. It's kind of crazy.  <br>00:22:00.380 So let's get back up tothe network tab over here.  <br>00:22:02.830 I don't need to switch to my pen.Ah, there we go. We'll go to network.  <br>00:22:05.860 And so far we've added a resourceby specifying the IP address.  <br>00:22:09.160 Like here's the IP Twin Gatewill take care of the rest.  <br>00:22:12.010 But we also saw how we could use DNS adomain name. Let's try it out real quick.  <br>00:22:15.940 So here in my network I'vegot a Prox Box server.  <br>00:22:19.330 It's great for hosting virtual machines.  <br>00:22:21.010 You can find it via DNS atprox dot hogwarts dot local.  <br>00:22:25.810 Now keeping in mind, thisis via my local DNS server.  <br>00:22:28.840 So here in my studio and maybe inyour network or your business network,  <br>00:22:32.290 you have a DNS [server.So](http://server.so/) when I ping prox max,  <br>00:22:36.010 it replies to the IP address becausemy private DNS server response,  <br>00:22:39.610 this is not accessibleon the big wild internet.  <br>00:22:42.280 Now how Twin Gate will useyour DNS servers crazy.  <br>00:22:44.950 But let's go ahead and add it real quick.  <br>00:22:46.120 So I'm gonna have my newemployee I created, which was me.  <br>00:22:48.940 I think I'm gonna have me access Proxbox. So we'll click on ad resource,  <br>00:22:53.980 we'll choose a remote network. We'llonly have one right now. We'll do dns,  <br>00:22:56.500 we'll label it. And thenI'll put in the DNS address,  <br>00:22:58.630 which is proxima dot hogwarts dot local.  <br>00:23:01.930 Notice I'm not telling it what IPaddress that it is or anything like that.  <br>00:23:06.040 I'm just saying the DNS address,the domain name for protocol.  <br>00:23:08.830 I'll allow everything just fortesting. And then I'll say only beards.  <br>00:23:12.670 Only beards can use this. So I haveone group, which is just gonna be me.  <br>00:23:16.180 Now first let's see if it worksbecause I don't wanna lie to you.  <br>00:23:18.700 I wanna get logged back in. I got loggedout. Oh I forgot I enforced mfa. Ugh,  <br>00:23:23.950 I'm gonna turn it off real quick. ,I don't feel like doing it right now.  <br>00:23:27.220 That's just bad security. Okay, cool.  <br>00:23:28.960 So I see Product Moss hereand currently I'm on 5g,  <br>00:23:31.300 so I'm not on my home network.  <br>00:23:32.860 I'm gonna authenticate and then copythe address and try to go to it.  <br>00:23:36.070 I'll do https, colon wwa,  <br>00:23:38.560 paste it in there and go to pour 8,006for Prox Max proceed. And there we go.  <br>00:23:43.510 Just like that. Lemme show youhow that, here's my network,  <br>00:23:46.250 here's my Prox MO server andhere's my uh, DNS server,  <br>00:23:50.090 which is actually running on a raspberrypie. It's agar. I highly recommend it.  <br>00:23:53.690 What's crazy is that the TwinGate connector, he does a lot,  <br>00:23:57.080 but what he also doesbeyond everything else,  <br>00:23:59.450 well not beyond just also isthat he proxies DNS request.  <br>00:24:04.160 He's a DNS proxy. Andhere's what that means.  <br>00:24:06.290 So me over here on my Twin Gateclient, I got Twin Gate on my phone.  <br>00:24:09.710 There's something kind of weird going onwith your Twin Gate client and by weird  <br>00:24:12.685 I mean awesome. This is the only timeI'll mention it using VPN by the way,  <br>00:24:16.730 it actually uses a VPN connection onyour phone and whatever device you're  <br>00:24:20.810 using, it's a VPNconnection to local host.  <br>00:24:24.500 So 1 2 7 0 0 1,  <br>00:24:28.250 which we all know that local host onetwo seven zero zero one is itself.  <br>00:24:31.940 It's the phone itself.  <br>00:24:32.990 It's making a VPN connection back toitself that has one purpose of Twin Gate.  <br>00:24:37.040 It's listening and waiting for attemptsto connect to resources and it's a acl.  <br>00:24:41.300 So it has a list of things that itknows I'm allowed to connect to,  <br>00:24:44.240 blah blah blah blah blah. One ofthose things being proxim max,  <br>00:24:46.970 it waits and listens and it goes,oh, oh, that's for me Proxim Max.  <br>00:24:50.210 It watches everything. And when it seesit's something meant for Twin Gate,  <br>00:24:53.900 it'll take it and send it to the TwinGate connector over its secure TLS Tunnel.  <br>00:24:57.470 Now in the case of dns, what it'll do is,  <br>00:24:59.330 you know we configured a resourcethat's prox box dot hogwarts dot  <br>00:25:03.920 local. When it sees proxbox dot hogwarts dot local,  <br>00:25:06.800 it's like okay that's in my list.  <br>00:25:08.600 It will then send this over our secureTLS connection TLS Tunnel to the Twin  <br>00:25:12.920 Gate connector and the connector willresolve that DNS request with its own  <br>00:25:16.880 configured DNS [server.So](http://server.so/) think about that.  <br>00:25:18.830 My twin gate connector that'ssitting inside my network,  <br>00:25:21.110 I gave it it's DNS server, whichis my private DNS server here.  <br>00:25:24.050 That's what it's using to resolve anyof those domain names I configure inside  <br>00:25:28.310 Twin Gate. That's pretty cool.  <br>00:25:29.390 And what that empowers me to do is DNSbase routing to different networks,  <br>00:25:33.950 which I don't think any othersolution does. It's kind of crazy.  <br>00:25:37.730 Now that's cool, but what if you don'thave a DNS server in your house? Well,  <br>00:25:40.820 twin Gate has a new feature calledAlias sis. Let's try it out real quick.  <br>00:25:44.300 Let's add another resource. Iwanna connect to my Plex server.  <br>00:25:46.490 So remote network hack WorldTech,I'll do a an IP address, the alias,  <br>00:25:49.670 I can make it whatever I want itto be. Plex dot beards dot awesome.  <br>00:25:53.720 I don't know that's what it's gonna be.  <br>00:25:54.950 I will only allow port 32,400 for Plex and that's it.  <br>00:25:59.330 I'll give me access Beards ofcourse. And that's the Plex server.  <br>00:26:03.170 Let's see if that alias works.If this works be kind of crazy,  <br>00:26:06.530 let's go to plex dot, beards dot awesome.  <br>00:26:10.460 Port 3 2 400. Is it working?Seems to be working.  <br>00:26:15.890 It worked. How cool is that?  <br>00:26:17.960 Now a couple of things incase you didn't notice this,  <br>00:26:20.330 you don't have to addjust individual resources.  <br>00:26:22.640 If you wanted to add a oneresource and make that a wild card,  <br>00:26:25.850 so either an IP address, saylike my network, do a slash 24,  <br>00:26:30.630 make that one resource and youget access to your entire network.  <br>00:26:33.560 Same goes for dns, which is prettystinking cool. Just do a wild card.  <br>00:26:36.890 I use this heavily by the way. And it'sso stinking cool. Makes things easy.  <br>00:26:40.070 At least for me.  <br>00:26:40.790 Like I only give myself access tothis and restrict everyone else.  <br>00:26:44.400 It just makes sense. Nowbecause this video is so long,  <br>00:26:46.740 I'm not gonna demo these last few things,  <br>00:26:48.210 but I just wanna touch on them real quickbecause they're so powerful and I do  <br>00:26:50.970 use them. If I go overto my team, we the top,  <br>00:26:54.600 I've got users groups and then there'sone thing I haven't talked about.  <br>00:26:57.270 And that's services. What is that?Click on that. Nothing there.  <br>00:27:01.350 What this is though, it's so cool.  <br>00:27:03.750 You've seen how we can install a TwinGate cloud on your phone, laptop,  <br>00:27:07.080 whatever. But they also haveheadless clients. They got no heads,  <br>00:27:11.550 which means you can install them on aLinux server with one command and they  <br>00:27:15.845 just work and it's so cool. SoI did this with um, uptime Kuma.  <br>00:27:21.030 So I had a LE server in the cloud.  <br>00:27:23.190 I installed Uptime Kuma on that and Iinstalled the Twin Gate headless client on  <br>00:27:26.760 there. And with that it was able tomonitor everything in my private network.  <br>00:27:31.830 And actually I lied. It wasn't myprivate network that was monitoring,  <br>00:27:34.530 I was actually doing the top secretYouTube thing I talked to you about.  <br>00:27:37.560 I was using this exact setupto monitor a couple hun. Uh,  <br>00:27:41.760 I can't tell you it was a lot of devices,but it did it like Twin Gate handle,  <br>00:27:45.150 all that. It was a wild car DNS [setup.It](http://setup.it/) was crazy. But services are cool.  <br>00:27:49.980 They're not the hardestsetup. It's a one-liner.  <br>00:27:51.630 Now what this also opensup is C I C D automation.  <br>00:27:55.350 And you can use things like Terraform where you can like just deploy  <br>00:27:59.015 infrastructure and with the infrastructurebuilt in the Terraform template,  <br>00:28:03.510 is that what they call it?I think it's a template,  <br>00:28:04.740 is deploying twin gate connectorsand headless clients and it just,  <br>00:28:09.450 you spin up things [automatically.It](http://automatically.it/)'s kind of crazy.  <br>00:28:12.510 So you can automate your access, automateyour zero trust. Two more things.  <br>00:28:16.200 If I go over to settings I,twin Gate's, a big thing, man.  <br>00:28:18.720 Two things you can look atright now. Identity provider,  <br>00:28:21.030 you can sync up GoogleWorkspace, Okta Azure ad.  <br>00:28:23.940 I personally use Google Workspace.Pretty cool. I sync up my employees.  <br>00:28:27.810 You can also do Secure dns.  <br>00:28:29.490 So you can actually have your clientsuse a secure DNS provider using D O H and  <br>00:28:33.450 you can specify that here. Sothat's Twin Gate. What do you think?  <br>00:28:36.240 Are you gonna throw away your VPN or areyou using something else that you think  <br>00:28:39.185 is better fighting? No, I'mjust kidding. But seriously,  <br>00:28:41.190 let me know below in the comments.I wanna know what you think.  <br>00:28:43.590 Grandma, go subscribe to Network.

Reduce the sauce to desired thickness, optionally using a cornstarch slurry to thicken.  <br>11. Reheat the lamb and shallots, serve with mashed potatoes, and pour the sauce over the lamb.  <br>12. Garnish with roasted shallots and fresh thyme leaves before serving.|**0:00**all right so by stomach and thyme**0:03**braised lamb shoulder this is a dish we**0:06**used to cook heaps of in a restaurant i**0:07**worked at in london called tom's kitchen**0:09**was uh owned by a chef or uncle tom**0:11**atkins**0:12**and his twin brother was working there**0:14**as well at time when i was working there**0:15**both fantastic chefs**0:18**i think rob now lives in the states and**0:20**tom's stool and chelsea so this dish is**0:23**a version of that dish kind of adapted**0:26**it a bit slightly for home for you guys**0:27**to cook at home**0:29**and i'm going to cook it in the slow**0:30**cooker just a domestic slow cooker i**0:31**think that works really well as a set**0:33**and forget type of dish um bit of work**0:35**in the morning and then when you kind of**0:36**in the afternoon it's all good to go**0:39**uh if you don't have a slow cooker you**0:40**can just do this in a cupboard pot or a**0:43**dutch oven in the oven that works just**0:44**as well**0:45**or even a pressure cooker so as far as**0:48**ingredients obviously we need a lamb**0:49**shoulder this is what's called an oyster**0:50**cut lamb shoulder from the guys in**0:53**victoria at hardworks these guys produce**0:54**some excellent land**0:56**and and the oyster cut is kind of that**0:58**top shoulder blade part but if you uh**1:01**want to do a whole lamb shoulder you can**1:02**definitely do that and adapt the recipe**1:04**just by doubling the other ingredients**1:06**or not even doubling um maybe another**1:08**half of the other ingredients um but you**1:10**just want lamb shoulder you want that**1:11**into muscular tissue and fat which you**1:14**know works really well on these slow**1:16**braises so then we just got some basic**1:18**chicken stock um if you're buying the**1:20**box type of chicken stock from**1:21**supermarket make sure you're getting a**1:22**low sodium one otherwise when you reduce**1:25**your sauce at the end it does become**1:27**often become a bit too salty**1:29**and basic naropa carrots and onions uh**1:31**some garlic thyme that's new vinegar**1:33**obviously and then we're gonna do some**1:35**of the shallots differently we'll cook**1:36**them separately so that we can really**1:38**control how well they're cooked and they**1:39**don't go kind of mushy um these shallots**1:41**when they're cooked like this**1:43**are delicious they're super tasty if you**1:45**can't find these shallots which i've**1:47**referred to as banana shallots i'm not**1:48**sure**1:49**maybe they're good french lots as well**1:52**if you can't find these just use baby**1:53**onions**1:54**let's get started**1:56**so first thing we need to do is get the**1:58**lamb shoulder ready and sealed off**1:59**before we put it in our slow cooker so**2:02**take your lamb out of your packet dry it**2:03**off and then give it a good season with**2:05**salt but no pepper at this point i find**2:07**that the pepper burns a bit too much**2:09**when you're trying to seal it off**2:10**in a heavy base fry pan with a decent**2:13**amount of oil in it put your lamb**2:15**shoulder in with the fat side down now**2:17**you're going to seal this off for about**2:18**10 to 15 minutes so you get good golden**2:20**color and while that's happening you can**2:22**get your mirror path sorted so cut your**2:23**onion in quarters and peel it slice your**2:26**carrot on an angle just take the tops**2:28**off no need to peel it either**2:30**cut a head of garlic in half and get**2:32**your thyme ready now you can see we're**2:34**starting to develop some good color on**2:35**this lamb but we really want to**2:37**emphasize how important it is to get as**2:39**much calories you can on this before you**2:41**start doing your veggies it's also**2:43**important to seal the slam on all sides**2:46**just to lock all that flavor in before**2:48**you start slow cooking it so once that's**2:50**sealed take it out and set it to the**2:52**side and then you can start getting some**2:54**color on your mirror file now don't be**2:56**as reckless as i am and be careful when**2:57**you've got hot oil in a pan just**2:59**chucking your carrots in but get some**3:01**good color on all sides on all your**3:03**carrots and onions**3:05**before you add your calf garlic clove**3:07**with the flesh side down**3:09**and your time as well just to start**3:11**getting those oils out of it you can**3:13**notice there i've also tied the time**3:15**together that just stops it from falling**3:16**apart making it easier to pull out**3:19**in goes your balsamic vinegar just to**3:20**deglaze the pan and then that goes in**3:22**the bottom of your slow cooker with your**3:24**lamb on top so now it's time to add the**3:26**chicken stock and on the recipe i've**3:28**called for a liter of chicken stock but**3:30**just use your initiative as to how much**3:31**you use because you don't want to**3:33**completely cover the lamb you still want**3:35**that delicious gold in the outside part**3:37**protruding the stock level**3:40**once you've got your stock in there and**3:42**goes the lid and into your slow cooker**3:44**on low for seven hours**3:46**and if you're doing this in an oven then**3:48**set your oven temperature to 80 degrees**3:50**celsius**3:51**all right so it's about seven hours**3:52**later and it's time to get our shallots**3:54**ready now you see i've peeled these but**3:55**i've left the core intact and that's**3:57**super important so it doesn't fall apart**3:59**when you cook it later so once you've**4:01**peeled them just slice them in half and**4:03**with that core intact it will stay**4:05**together once you cook them**4:07**onto a tray and then just give them a**4:08**good seasoning with salt and then over**4:11**to a pan on medium heat that you can**4:13**ideally put this pan in the oven**4:14**otherwise you have to take them out and**4:16**put them on a tray you can put them in**4:17**the oven so with a light drizzle of**4:19**olive oil put the shallots skin side**4:21**down and after about two or three**4:23**minutes you can add your dollop of**4:25**butter**4:26**once your butter is all nice and browned**4:28**you can add your sprigs of thyme and**4:29**then check to make sure that you've got**4:31**nice color on the slots for adding your**4:33**balsamic vinegar**4:35**into 180 degree oven for 15 to 20**4:39**minutes or until they're just cooked you**4:41**know nice you can put a knife through**4:43**them**4:44**but they're still holding together**4:46**all right time to deal to this lamb**4:48**shoulder so pull your slow cooker out**4:50**and get a tray ready for your lamb**4:53**shoulder and you're going to remove the**4:55**slam shoulder from the source uh nice**4:57**and carefully just making sure it**4:59**doesn't fall apart on you now it**5:00**shouldn't fall apart after seven hours**5:02**it should stay together um but it will**5:04**be tender so you know take your time and**5:06**be delicate with it so in a clean**5:08**saucepan through a fine mesh sieve**5:10**you're just going to pass your braising**5:12**liquid off and this is what's going to**5:14**make the sauce so it's super flavorful**5:17**but you just want to pass it and then**5:19**give it a skimmed make sure there's none**5:21**of that lamb fat kind of on the top you**5:22**don't want that lamp fat emulsifying**5:24**into your sauce and friendly reminder to**5:26**keep your bench clean while you're**5:27**cooking**5:29**um so once that's come to the boil**5:31**give it a taste make sure the**5:33**seasoning's not too crazy just yet and**5:35**keep reducing this down until you've got**5:37**the flavor or the seasoning kind of**5:39**right where you want it and i'll be**5:41**tasting it every five to six minutes**5:42**just to make sure**5:44**i did this for about 25 minutes until i**5:46**was happy with it**5:48**all right so your shallots should be**5:49**ready now just pull those out and put**5:51**them on the same tray as the lamb we're**5:52**going to flash that to to reheat it when**5:54**we're ready with the sauce**5:57**this also stays in good but**5:59**i am going to cheat a bit and we're**6:01**going to thicken it with a bit of**6:02**cornstarch because after all this is**6:04**effectively a home cooking channel**6:06**rather than a professional cooking**6:07**channel in the real world in the**6:08**restaurant world we were never allowed**6:10**to thicken our sauces with corn flour or**6:12**roos or anything like that**6:14**these like very traditional kind of**6:16**style sauces um but you know hey we're**6:18**at home we can do what we want the only**6:20**other thing i'd say is it's a bit um too**6:22**forward on the carrot so i think i just**6:24**overdid it with the carrot i think i put**6:26**two in there uh in the recipe i'll put**6:28**one on i think it's gonna be just a**6:29**little bit less carrot but other than**6:31**that it's a it's a pretty tasty little**6:32**sauce**6:36**so to thicken our sauce with cornflour**6:37**we're going to make it what we call a**6:38**slurry so take your cornflour and then**6:40**just dissolve it in some cold water**6:42**before you pour into your sauce if you**6:45**pour the the cornflour directly into the**6:47**sauce it's just gonna go all lumpy**6:49**so it's also important to whisk your**6:51**slurry in while there's heat under the**6:53**sauce**6:54**um so now we're ready to plate so you're**6:56**gonna reheat your lamb shoulder and**6:58**shallots and i've just done some mash**7:00**here to have with it and i think this is**7:02**the perfect dish to serve family style**7:04**like we are here so take your lamb**7:07**shoulder from the oven and carefully**7:09**move it to your serving dish**7:11**and then now that you have your lamb**7:13**shoulder successfully in your plating**7:15**dish it's time to pour some of that**7:18**sauce all over it and don't be shy with**7:20**that sauce pretty good stuff**7:22**so**7:23**the final main garnish some your roasted**7:25**shallots all over it**7:28**and then we're just going to finish it**7:29**with a few picked thyme leaves um as a**7:32**little bit of extra garnish and yes i**7:33**did cut myself but i'm okay**7:36**we have a balsamic and thyme braised**7:38**lamb shoulder**7:45**time to eat**7:56**oh just literally tears away**8:11**so delicious the lamb's**8:13**like perfectly tender you know it's not**8:15**like it doesn't dissolve in your mouth**8:17**it's delicious**8:21**with that creamy mash and the balsamic**8:23**it just works really well with lamb**8:26**you know that kind of sweet acidity just**8:28**works really well with the sweet meat of**8:30**lamb**8:32**no wonder we should sell so many of**8:33**these**8:37**stunning**8:39**guys definitely take the time to make**8:40**this one day**8:42**super comforting dish the leftovers are**8:44**really easy to use up as well**8:47**chuck it in

video what**0:19**we're going to do is check out app**0:21**Images an app image is a form of**0:24**software delivery it's basically an**0:26**all-in-one package a universal package**0:28**you download it run it and it's as**0:30**simple as that in this video what I'm**0:33**going to do is teach you everything that**0:35**you need to know to use app Images**0:37**you'll know what they are in the first**0:39**place how they work and why you might**0:41**want to consider using app Images over**0:43**other types of Linux packaging now if**0:46**you're not already familiar with the**0:47**concept Universal packages are a**0:50**relatively New Concept in Linux and the**0:52**idea is to have software being packaged**0:54**in a way where the drro doesn't matter**0:57**so that effectively means you could have**0:58**one application and it could run on just**1:01**about any distribution and this approach**1:03**is great for developers too because it**1:05**takes the dro out of the equation so if**1:07**someone is developing an app for Linux**1:09**then they only need to develop one thing**1:11**to Target the entirety of the Linux**1:13**community and then when it comes to you**1:15**the user you benefit because it doesn't**1:17**matter which distribution you run your**1:19**choice is respected you could use**1:20**anything you want and then you could**1:22**bring your applications with you and app**1:25**Images are one of three main types of**1:27**universal packages we have snap snap**1:30**packages flat packs and of course app**1:32**Images I already have videos in this**1:35**series on Snap packages and flat packs**1:37**so I'll leave a card for the snap video**1:39**right about here if you want to check**1:41**that out anyway I can't wait to dive inThe ad**1:44**but before I do I need to take a moment**1:46**and let you guys know that I have two**1:47**brand new courses available over on UD**1:49**to me first if you're in the process of**1:52**learning Linux for the very first time**1:53**you should definitely check out my Linux**1:55**Essentials course not only will this**1:57**course teach you everything you need to**1:58**know to get started Ed and learn the**2:00**basics of Linux it's also going to help**2:02**you get certified and earn your Linux**2:04**Essentials credential through LPI and**2:07**the Linux professional Institute is the**2:08**world's largest Linux and open source**2:10**focused vendor neutral certification**2:12**body so by earning certifications**2:14**through LPI your credentials will be**2:16**recognized around the world but even if**2:19**you don't have any interest in getting**2:20**certified this course is still a great**2:22**fit for those of you that are getting**2:23**started with Linux because it'll teach**2:25**you all the basics also I recently**2:28**released an anable course as well which**2:30**will teach you everything you need to**2:31**know to get up and running with anible**2:33**anible is one of if not the most popular**2:35**configuration and automation Platforms**2:37**in the Linux ecosystem so it's**2:39**definitely something that you need to**2:41**learn anible is a powerful and easy**2:43**tolearn platform that'll enable you to**2:45**automate even the most complicated Linux**2:47**Administration tasks and just like with**2:50**my Linux course each lesson will break**2:52**down even the most complicated**2:53**components and Concepts into easy to**2:56**understand lessons and by the end of the**2:57**course you'll learn everything that you**2:59**need to know know to use anible as part**3:01**of your daily tool set and as usual**3:03**thank you guys so much for supporting**3:05**Linux learning I really appreciate that**3:07**now it's time to dive into app images**3:09**and learn all about them so let's getWhat is an "AppImage"?**3:15**started so here we have an app image now**3:18**at first it doesn't look like much but**3:20**believe it or not this one file is a**3:23**complete application specifically Caden**3:25**live Caden live is an application you**3:27**could use to edit video in in fact I've**3:30**used Kaden live for many of the videos**3:32**on this channel before switching to D**3:34**Vinci resolve now this particular app**3:36**image I downloaded from the official**3:38**website so one thing to know about app**3:40**Images is that they could come from just**3:42**about anywhere often you'll find app**3:44**images on a developer's website when**3:46**they're making a program available and**3:47**it's not all that dissimilar to Windows**3:50**and Mac OS when you discover a new**3:51**application you download it you install**3:53**it but in this case we have an app image**3:55**so how do we go about running this well**3:58**the first thing we need to do is right**3:59**click on**4:01**it then we'll check the**4:04**properties and this might look different**4:06**for you depending on your desktop**4:07**environment but basically we want to go**4:09**to**4:10**permissions and we want to allow**4:12**executing as a program so I'll check**4:15**this right here and that's all we need**4:17**to do to make an app image work**4:19**seriously that's it so all we have to do**4:22**is just click on it like we would any**4:24**other**4:26**application so right here we have Caden**4:29**live how cool is**4:30**that now one thing to point out is that**4:34**I've created a directory called**4:37**applications it's very common when you**4:39**use app Images to want to save them all**4:40**in one place it doesn't really matter**4:42**where you save them you can even save**4:44**them in your home directory on your**4:45**desktop it doesn't really matter but**4:47**what I like to do is create a folder a**4:49**Parent Directory basically where all of**4:51**my app Images are going to live so we**4:54**only have this one right here so how do**4:57**we go about downloading an app image asHow do you generally obtain an AppImage?**5:00**I mentioned one of the most popular**5:01**places to find an app image is the**5:03**official website for whatever**5:04**application you're trying to install so**5:07**let's bring up a web**5:10**browser and here we have the browser so**5:13**what I'm going to do is just search for**5:15**bit**5:16**Worden then here's the official website**5:18**so I'll click on**5:20**that what we'll do is go to**5:23**download scroll down a bit here and you**5:26**can see that we have downloads for**5:28**Windows Mac OS and Linux so what I'm**5:31**going to do is click on**5:35**Linux and already I'm downloading an app**5:37**image seriously check this**5:39**out by default bit Wen is released as an**5:42**app image it's not the only way that you**5:44**could install bit Wen but it is a**5:46**popular way and it's available right**5:48**from the developer's website so we know**5:50**it's official we always want to make**5:52**sure that we're downloading applications**5:53**from official sources and it doesn't get**5:56**any more official than the official**5:57**website for the product so let's go**6:00**ahead and go back to our file manager**6:03**here and what I'm doing right now is**6:05**just grabbing it from my downloads**6:06**directory and I'm pasting the app image**6:09**into my applications directory and now**6:11**we have it so just like before I'm going**6:13**to right click on it I'm going to go**6:16**down to**6:18**properties let's allow executing as a**6:22**program we'll close it I'll just simply**6:25**click on**6:28**it and there you go bit Warden is now**6:31**running I didn't install it so there's**6:33**no installation procedure all I had to**6:35**do was download the app image make it**6:37**executable and I'm done and that's oneMore specifics regarding AppImages**6:40**of the main benefits of the app image**6:41**format there's no runtime or anything to**6:44**install or set up first you just simply**6:46**run an app image and that's it now when**6:48**you compare app Images to you know snap**6:51**packages and flat packs those formats**6:54**tend to be a little bit heavier now I**6:56**like all the formats don't get me wrong**6:58**I'm not saying you should pick one over**6:59**the other but what I'm saying though is**7:01**that there are clear differences for**7:03**example when it comes to snap packages**7:05**there's the snap store so when you want**7:07**to download a snap package in that**7:09**format you have to download it from the**7:11**Snap Store you also have to have snapd**7:13**installed as well so in that case there**7:15**is something that you need to install**7:17**first when it comes to Flat pack you**7:19**don't have to get flat packs from the**7:21**flathub App Store quote unquote App**7:24**Store and you do need to have flat pack**7:25**installed first before you can install a**7:28**flat pack but again with app Images you**7:30**don't have to install anything but one**7:32**of the bigger downsides of the app image**7:34**format is the**7:36**inconsistency for example earlier in the**7:38**video I downloaded Caden live and I ran**7:41**that when I did so it didn't ask me if I**7:43**wanted a desktop shortcut or an**7:45**application menu shortcut it just ran**7:48**and the problem here is if I check my**7:50**applications list it's not going to be**7:52**visible because it's not actually**7:54**installed and that kind of makes sense**7:56**because an app image is well just a file**7:59**there really isn't anything to install**8:01**so that's why we don't have a desktop**8:03**icon however some applications will ask**8:06**you if you want to integrate the**8:08**application which means create a desktop**8:10**or application launcher**8:12**shortcut now even though not every app**8:15**image will prompt you to create an**8:17**application launcher there is a**8:19**workaround and it's called app image**8:21**launcher and I already have it**8:23**downloaded right here I'm going to leave**8:24**a link to this in the description down**8:26**below but this is going to be a**8:28**distribution package this time note the**8:30**Deb format here in my case so when you**8:33**install app image launcher it basically**8:35**manages all of this for you so I'm just**8:37**going to install it right**8:39**now now the package is installed but**8:42**there's not really a whole lot to see**8:44**this is going to run in the background**8:47**but basically what that will do is**8:49**intercept the fact that we are opening**8:50**an app image so it'll see that we're**8:53**opening one and if a launcher isn't**8:55**already on the system for whatever one**8:57**we're launching it's going to give us an**8:59**option to create that so for example**9:02**what I'll do is open Kaden live**9:04**again and we see immediately that app**9:07**image launcher saw that we were**9:09**launching an app image and sprang into**9:12**action so right now it's going to see**9:15**the folder that we're currently inside**9:17**of and just assume that that's the**9:18**folder where all of our app Images are**9:20**going to be you could customize this and**9:23**you should customize this if you want to**9:24**put them somewhere else but that's okay**9:26**for me so I'll just click okay and right**9:29**now it's offering to integrate it for us**9:31**we could run once or integrate it into**9:33**our system run once is useful if you**9:36**only plan on running an app image just**9:38**one time but if you plan on keeping it**9:40**around you might want to click this**9:41**button right**9:46**here now we see that the app image is**9:50**launching and when I try to open**9:53**applications we can see that Caden live**9:55**is listed right there so as you can see**9:58**even though there's some downsides with**10:00**app Images there's some easy workarounds**10:02**to make it even**10:04**better now before I close out the videoAppImage Hub**10:07**I just wanted to show you guys one more**10:08**thing and that is the app image Hub so**10:11**even though there's no one app store for**10:14**app images and you could also download**10:16**them from the vendor's website most of**10:18**the time you'll also find app Images**10:20**here as well and this might be a good**10:22**place to start so let's click browse all**10:28**apps and and you can see that there's**10:30**quite a few listed**10:31**here now obviously I can't show you all**10:34**of them there's over 1,300 app images on**10:36**the site but if you're looking for a**10:38**good place to start then app image Hub**10:41**might be a great place I'll be sure to**10:43**have a link in the description down**10:44**below if you want to check it**10:48**out and there you go we just took a look**10:51**at app images in this video I love app**10:53**Images they're just so cool it's a**10:55**wonder why they're not more popular**10:57**hopefully this video will increase their**10:59**popularity because I think it's**11:01**definitely something that you should**11:02**check out anyway thank you so much for**11:04**checking out this video I really**11:06**appreciate it and I'll see you in the**11:07**next video**11:10**[Music]**11:25**[Music]English (auto-generated)[40:57Now

big**0:05**news that took place on Christmas Eve if you missed it Travis kenck planning to leave the board at Uber and when he**0:12**showed me what he was working on I immediately said hey can I invest a popular 70 billion doll ride sharing company is searching for a new CEO to**0:19**take the wheel so you want to talk about structure being completely screwy competition is good I'll bet my entire**0:26**network that Uber will be here and thriving in 10 years you're you're at War prematurely with your customers**0:33**sorry about [Music] that all right**0:42**[Applause] everybody my**0:49**guy um uh I can't believe I can't believe I get to sit down with one of the most**0:56**famous investors in Uber I'm honored I'm honored to be**1:02**here um we we wanted to have a surprise for you every day uh I've been you know**1:09**Travis and I have been friends for 25 years um the first time I interviewed Travis was 1999 I was doing a little**1:16**magazine out here digital Coast reporter you were doing a little company called scour um which was a peer-to-peer**1:22**Network to share files um and you were 22 years old I was**1:27**28 I think if we put those two numbers together just don't let people do the math you know it's just like just keep**1:32**moving was a while ago 1999 um and um I**1:38**just remember the enthusiasm drive and fire that you had at that time and it always**1:45**struck me I said to myself I don't know if he's going to win on this one I'm pretty sure he's going to get his ass**1:50**handed to him in fact correct correct um but I know this guy's going to win big**1:56**in the future and and sure enough uh we got to go on a great journey together with Uber and now again with Cloud**2:02**kitchens and I every year when we're hanging out I say since you left Uber I say you know**2:08**whenever you're ready let's have a conversation and here we are and then you call me every year I call you every year if you're ready just and I'm just a**2:16**block away from you you're Alma moer UCLA let's go come on I'm like all right let's let's go and**2:24**this year you said okay so here we are um let's chop it up let's talk about Cloud kitchens you have since uh youWhat Travis is working on at Cloud Kitchens**2:32**left Uber been working extremely hard and quietly on cloud kitchens what is**2:38**the vision what is cloud kitchens for people who don't know well uh**2:44**so yeah I mean it it is kind of funny when you go from being a tech guy to a kitchen guy I mean that's interesting um**2:51**look food has I think we all know like food is it's at the center of the Human**2:58**Experience the center of humanity and just just how we live but it's got a lot of**3:03**problems Health cost convenience like all that stuff and it could be a hell of**3:12**a lot better and so um of course in my last at my last gig we did Uber Eats it**3:20**was a starting point but the difference with food versus rides is that the**3:25**infrastructure was already there you had a bunch of cars that were 98% unutilized and so you just had to light it up but**3:32**to do food right you needed to build the infrastructure and so the mission for**3:38**our company is infrastructure for better food and the idea is like can you get**3:44**the preparation and delivery of food so high quality and most importantly so**3:51**cost efficient that it starts to approach the cost of you going to the grocery store if that happens you do to**3:57**the kitchen what Uber did to the car and so the quiet part is like we go and**4:04**buy real estate we do construction we then go talk to the**4:11**center point of what matters in food which is the restaurant tour the entrepreneur who's making it who does it**4:20**just because I mean it's a labor of love you got to have a deep passion for food and a deep passion for people because**4:26**otherwise you couldn't survive in that world uh but these guys are like like true blue entrepreneurs and they are our**4:32**customer and you do it from their perspective and you help them get their**4:38**vision for what they're doing out there and do it super super efficiently um and**4:44**so we like to say we serve those who serve others we're not the restaurant we're the guys**4:49**underneath and uh currently I think we have real estate we we have facilities**4:54**in all the major cities in 30 countries around the world um we also have a**5:00**software division so we have hundreds of thousands of restaurants using our software stack um and we have a robotics**5:06**division um that you know got going with a lot of the original sort of uber atg**5:12**guys Advanced Technology Group the the autonomy guys so we got that crew together and um have really you know**5:20**robots that are going to that already are out there but are going to**5:26**be out there in a really big way over the coming you know quarters and years so the premise of uber was hey press a**5:34**button we move you or anything from point A to point B what a profound**5:39**simple but profound um insight as an entrepreneur and the Insight here is**5:45**hey getting you food uh quickly efficiently and then making it easier**5:51**for a restaurant tour to pop up a restaurant tell us the economics of a food brand um when Jade and I and the**5:59**family were out here here on vacation over the summer at Manhattan Beach we had a wonderful experience of ordering**6:04**gwenneth Pal's Cloud kitchen and these new brands great um yeah great great new**6:10**brands popping up um talk about the economics for that food entrepreneur I**6:15**mean It's just tough I think most of us know a restaurant tour some of us may have even tried to do a restaurant or be**6:22**a part of it in some fashion I like I said it's a labor of love but like your**6:27**big costs are going to be labor let's call it between you know let's call it**6:32**30% but it can range from like 25 to 40% of your overall Revenue occupancy which**6:38**is the the physical space itself uh let's call it between six and 12% of**6:46**Revenue uh supply chain is 30% uh marketing let's call it 10 um I**6:52**know I'm missing something somewhere but those are the that's the big stuff and a successful restaurant's going to have a**6:59**10 % profit margin and be really pumped about that wow um and so yeah that's**7:05**just how it works um you know one thing I wanted to say just sort of the high level to like sort of how do you connect**7:10**the dots on like sort of where Innovation is going is that um you know my sweet spot is digitizing the physical**7:17**world and you know you could take that to mean a lot of different things but**7:22**it's basically treating atoms like bits and so we know the bits world is a**7:28**computer okay computers well CPU manipulates the bits storage stores the**7:33**bits Network moves bits from point A to point B but if you're treating atoms**7:39**like bits you go CPU manipulates the bits what manipulates atoms that's**7:45**manufacturing storage stores bits what stores atoms that's Real Estate Network**7:52**moves bits from point A to point B what uh yeah what moves atoms well**7:59**that's transport of logistics and so these are the three sort of core**8:05**Computing resources in a atoms based computer and you can say my last gig was**8:11**so much about the network for the physical world but there's just a huge**8:16**amount of innovation left in compute and storage for the physical world also**8:22**known as digitized manufacturing and digitized real estate and so our company is really**8:29**sort of building atoms based computers and sort of our first computer is really a food**8:36**computer so that's kind of how we think about it yeah um let's take a look at the video of um some of the robots uh**8:44**that are making food in Cloud kitchens**8:49**[Music]**8:59**and that's our lab we're doing that in house all in house yeah all this stuff is in house**9:05**[Music]**9:22**[Applause] [Music]**9:44**so we call this part like look ma no hands right so once the dispensers are full of**9:50**food nobody touches it and what comes out on a conveyor belt is bags of food that get delivered amazing right so you**9:58**know LED bag sealed you get the general idea so now you have a a restaurant that can**10:06**asynchronously produce for consumers from what labor is doing and the labor**10:11**is primarily on the on the prep side of things so we see there's kind of vessels**10:17**there um I'm assuming they have ingredients in them the bowl goes by stuff gets dropped in organized covered**10:25**put in a bag label goes on the human has no part in that except for maybe**10:31**preparing and and filling prep let's say you have prep in the morning this machine can run for hours without**10:37**anybody there um and so you know there's interesting you know so so it just**10:43**becomes a more efficient thing so the if you want to do to the kitchen what Uber**10:49**did to the car you have to make sure two things happen one is that you need the**10:54**logistics the movement of food needs to go to the cost of that needs to go to zero this is a autonomous vehicles**11:00**things along these lines and then the production of food must also get uh sort of roboticized mechanized essentially**11:08**those two things happen and then we can always cook but it can be out of choice**11:15**and um you know I like to say I like a I I like horses but I don't ride a horse to work and so um you can get higher**11:23**quality food to the people at a lower cost and just give people the most precious of commodities**11:29**back which is called time to do all the things all the other things in life that they love and you're strategically**11:37**placing these Cloud kitchens um in I get I would assume very**11:42**lowcost real estate but that's at very key uh locations that make it very**11:49**efficient to uh deliver the food yeah yeah so on the software side we we have**11:56**a software stack that like I said hundreds of of thousands of restaurants use we're seeing 18% of all online**12:04**delivery in the US as an example our software is touching so because we see**12:09**where all of the delivery is we know where to put a delivery only restaurant**12:16**facility um and so we find distressed real estate or sort of unique situations**12:22**where it's hard to develop and we've built a competence in sort of turning that into a 30 kitchen facility that we**12:30**then lease those kitchens to restaurant tours let's talk about the Playbook this is something you worked on really hardTravis's operating playbook**12:37**at Uber hiring Josh in New York will in La we had a podcast and you were set on**12:44**that podcast years and years ago hey I'm looking for some people to run some cities to run Uber and you found this**12:49**eclectic group of Samurai and you let**12:54**them go um and man they cooked yeah talk to me about that management principle**13:01**and your management principles hey be pumped you know and and bringing that enthusiasm that fire and letting those**13:08**cities cook because most people have this top down they do things sequentially you've really and and in**13:15**those early days got more and more emboldened and excited about doing things in parallel and letting people**13:21**make mistakes in those regions and learning they could I remember Josh started doing messenger delivery you let**13:28**other people deliver kittens for a day to an office to that was a funny thing yeah JD Vance that's when he uninstalled**13:34**Uber um no kittens um but cookies whatever it was ice cream trucks yeah**13:41**talk about that model of letting you know a th flowers bloom letting these Samurai go crazy so look we had a a**13:50**cultural value at Uber called let Builders build and I'm sure it was there are other companies that I think may**13:56**have said that before us uh but we we certainly took a hold of that and look as it related to our GM model and and**14:04**how to empower GMS to do well it starts with who is the person and we I always**14:10**felt that the the magic making happens when you cross uh sort**14:16**of uh creative instincts with analytical capabilities or prowess**14:23**really so we would just design tests that sort of simulated what it would be**14:28**like working together that tested their creative stuff their secret their secret**14:36**sauce and creativity but would create problems where it was crossed with the necessity to analytically solve problems**14:45**got it and so you put those two things together with a hungry person that maybe**14:50**just got out their MBA or let's say equivalent and they're fired up and**14:55**ready to go and you Empower them and then you put very simple controls to make sure that**15:05**they're check that like like like waypoints that in order to go further they have to pass that test once they're**15:12**in the job and just simple things like we would have a pricing call in the early days of uber where you cannot put**15:20**it up in the app until you pass the pricing call the first 30 cities I was on that pricing call and the thing about**15:27**price when it comes to Transportation it's a amalgamation of all strategy across everything across what does your**15:34**cars look like what's the supply the supply uh what does uh what does Metro**15:40**or public uh public transport look like what is cost of Labor in that City uh what are their General alternatives for**15:47**getting around what are regulations like ultimately becomes a service with a price you pass that and then you run you**15:55**get to run a city but that means the previous 30 days or 90 days when they're just doing lots**16:02**of stuff I don't have to worry and then they get to that point they pass the**16:07**test they know what the criteria for passing the test is so it forces them**16:13**into the right mode right let's talk about strategy you know one of the greatStrategy at Uber: Competing with Lyft, surge pricing, dealing with bad press**16:19**privileges of of getting to be involved you know in your journey for a little bit was we would talk sometimes late at**16:26**night weekends uh when there were really dicey strategy moments and I'd ask you**16:32**what you're thinking and we would just jam out and a couple of those conversations I remember calling you in**16:38**a panic after having taken a lift a ride chair and we were only Uber black yeah**16:44**and I said trais I just got out of this thing it's $16 it would have been 60 I'm pricing sensitive but man**16:51**this is going to change everything and you're like jakow and I said don't you don't understand J no this is disrup and**16:57**you said we're launching it next week we got it you know it is disruptive and you saw you know the the Lincoln Town Cars**17:05**were so brilliant you know because there were such high margins but you saw the disruptiveness of of the rering thing**17:11**and then surge pricing we had a big debate about tipping let's talk about some of those seminal moments in product**17:18**design yeah and competition because this was not happening in a vacuum people forget**17:24**there was sidecar there was lift yeah and then there were Regulators this was a war yeah so I mean kind of a funny**17:32**story I'm not sure if I've ever told you this you were you were only six weeks behind Zuck right which is I first heard**17:39**about Lyft from Zuck H and he's like yo**17:46**yo I think you have a situation on your hands and like Su would sort of do that like with like a little with you**17:52**kind of sit yeah kind of like that yeah he's he's a puck yeah and I'm like thank**18:00**you and um but the thing was was look it was at the beginning that was like they**18:07**called their rides donation it was a donation thing it was non-commercial**18:14**because there was no insurance there was no regulation there was basically just**18:20**citizen giving another citizen a ride across town and we didn't do anything about it for 9 months because we were**18:27**already getting our asses hand handed to us and we were doing the legal thing and so I'm like dude like we're we got like**18:34**I got threatened by the city of San Francisco and the state of California 3 months after we launched Uber with 90**18:39**days in jail for every ride that had occurred yeah so then this thing is like**18:46**it's a donation I swear and by the way if you don't give the donation they suggest then you get kicked off the**18:51**system yeah right so we're like H we're not going to do that and we saw Lyft**18:56**eating our market share up from the bottom up because they didn't have**19:01**insurance or regulation or any of these other things and then nine months into**19:07**it uh the city of San Francisco the state of California because it's was a California pu said ah you know it's**19:14**totally fine and then we're like oh so then we hustled got our thing going which is**19:22**called would at the time was called peer-to-peer ride sharing right um and then just got working and um um the way**19:29**we did it was like the reason we didn't do it in the first place is because it was clearly not like legit and but then**19:37**California said yes and so I made a PCT with myself that was like I'm never going to let this happen again and so**19:44**each and every city we went to we would send we would wait for Lift to launch**19:51**and then we would basically say to the city we'd send them a letter saying there's this really cool thing called ride sharing this company called lft is**19:57**doing it um we think it's great but our read of your regs is like it's probably not**20:05**allowed because you're thoughtful you want to be thoughtful but if you don't**20:12**enforce in the next 30 days we're going to participate as well great so almost**20:18**every city in the US other than two we can talk about those two by the way but in all every city in the US other than**20:24**two Portland Vegas we were number two in R**20:30**sharing um be for this reason um and we did this actually internationally we did it across Europe**20:36**we did it everywhere there were other folks that were out there and we would talk to the regulatory guys say if you're going to enforce do it but if**20:42**you're not we're going to participate yeah and that work that's kind of how we rolled and surch pricing was an interesting one you know um the**20:51**Brilliance of the of the Uber Marketplace was in many ways tackling**20:58**demand and figuring out a way to get uh drivers to come out on New Year's Eve**21:05**the worst night of their lives to drive and you came up with a pretty novel approach which is hey we'll**21:12**pay you double we'll pay you triple yeah and if you don't want to participate in that as a customer that's fine but we**21:18**think availability is more important uh than necessarily having standardized**21:24**pricing and man the world got very very upset at this and you and I talked about when you**21:30**explained it to me I said that makes logical sense and I said you know what we should do we should write a blog post and that blog post is still up I think**21:36**where you just explained it to people I thought Uber took down all my blog posts they probably yeah that might be a little but this blog post where you just**21:42**said hey here's how to handle New Year's Eve leave at this time go back at this time but we need to get these people on**21:49**the road and they deserve to be compensated so surge pricing there's another way to say it**21:54**now I called it surge pricing on purpose because I didn't want any body to think we were trying to deceive them right so**22:03**we said surge pricing like it's clear what's going on um but the other way to say surge pricing is called the lowest**22:11**cost reliable ride because if surge pricing goes up**22:17**too much then you have drivers that aren't making any money um and by the way they'll go to the**22:23**competition but if surge pricing is exactly at and by the way if surge pricing is not enough you're not not going to be able to get a ride because**22:29**too many people are going to want it and there won't be enough cars sech price in the right spot it draws enough Supply**22:36**in and fends off enough customers and the market clears so it's the lowest**22:43**cost reliable ride and that's why we knew it was a winner even when all of the competition and the world generally**22:50**was like hating on this idea anytime we were doing surge pricing and**22:56**our competitor wasn't we knew we were gaining market share because somebody could just come to us and get a ride when in the other system they couldn't**23:04**so you're proving reliability you're proving it's the lowest cost reliable ride that's it yeah um take me to you**23:14**know real quick led to a massive super interesting Logistics**23:22**cross with economics problem where at the peak I mean and I don't know what it**23:27**is at Uber today but it was like I don't know like 150 phds working on this**23:34**problem that we just described huh inside the company yeah which is like how do you find that lowest cost**23:41**reliable ride is a very very difficult problem in a live Logistics system like**23:47**this let's talk about Regulators in relation to people being independent contractors this is when I realized the**23:54**Press was acting without good faith data or logic and as**24:00**a former journalist you know it was kind of eye openening to me to be on the other side of the table and watching**24:06**this happened because we knew full well based on driver data that they loved**24:11**their jobs at Uber because they had Free Will and they could go and do any other**24:16**job they wanted and let's be clear the average Uber driver during my you know let's say at the end of my tenure was**24:23**eight hours a week so they clearly like it clearly a side gig yeah side hustle**24:29**and they wanted the flexibility over everything else work**24:35**when I want don't work when I want and then these**24:40**Union politicians and everything said no and the people who own the medallions and this is a cobal of really bad actors**24:48**who were saying no they have to work a shift and they have to go work for somebody who owns a medallion who gets**24:55**50 60 70% of the economics and they portrayed us or you as the bad guy in**25:01**all this and this was the exact opposite of the truth so um yeah I mean it was a union**25:10**problem which is it's very difficult to organize people who in this classic area**25:18**which is very Union organized called drivers it's very difficult to organize**25:24**them when they choose when they want to work their office is their own it's**25:29**their own like nobody controls it like there there's just no control and so**25:35**other than the control given to the individual and so it was very disruptive to the union and their own**25:42**business model and so they had to cut it off at the knees and so that became a**25:50**mix of a sort of political discourse and like a media push crossed with sort of**25:58**of regulatory uh lobbying and like like**26:03**trying to make political apparatuses do what's necessary to constrain it and you**26:10**took the approach we will fight there are wartime CEOs there are peacetime CEOs I put you in the category with ElonBeing a "War time CEO" and competing in China**26:17**of wartime CEOs who it does not matter how many battles you must battle**26:24**concurrently we're going to fight because it's we're on the right side yeah of History yeah uh but this became**26:32**acute the number of battles yeah that you had to fight the number of fronts**26:37**increase take us to the darkest peak of it because every time I talked to you I felt fine about it but**26:44**other investors other people felt like hey this is too many battles to wage at once talk to me about you personally**26:52**fighting all those battles I my perception of you was the more battles emerged Yeah the more you realized you**27:00**were doing the right thing it filled your bucket it powered you it gave energy to you to know we were on the**27:07**right side so yeah I you know sort of in justest I would I would say to folks I'd**27:13**be like so you know I'm not sure how it became so**27:19**controversial that one citizen giving another citizen aide across town became**27:25**such a thing I I'm not sure how that happened but it did uh the darkest moment I me the thing is is like you'd**27:32**keep it was almost like we were always pushing into that**27:38**area so like if something became easy then we'd push elsewhere until that**27:43**became hard so it was constant is like I make the analogy to like**27:49**a to teams that we have in different places then and now like a a world class**27:55**marathoner I've never seen a worldclass marathoner a mile 19 look like he's just honky Dory yeah**28:02**right and if he was he's about to lose so you push right to that edge of**28:09**what's possible and if that starts to get easy you push further now it doesn't necessar mean you push in exactly that**28:16**along that axis it could be in a totally different area but um as long as the**28:23**problems you're solving are greater than the problems you're**28:29**creating then you're fine when the problems you're creating are starts**28:36**to when the derivative of problems you're creating is greater than the**28:41**derivative of the problems you're solving then you have a real problem right and that's when you have to start**28:46**pulling back get back to above water and then go back into it but when I talk**28:52**about creating problems I think of it like think of it as like a math professor a math profess professor**28:58**without a really cool interesting problem to solve is a sad math professor and that's how we would think**29:04**about it right these we always pushing to the point where we're sweating yeah and it's**29:10**like not sure and there could be late nights there could be all nighters it could be that thing but because we were**29:17**doing the right thing because we had great people in the field who believed**29:23**then we could push all the way to that edge uh only they could be world class marathoners too only two entrepreneurs I**29:31**know have had the audacity to not build**29:36**their products in China everybody does that that's pretty easy but to actually operate a business in China yeah you and**29:43**Elon uh decided we're going to try to compete him with selling cars inside of**29:49**China pretty crazy uh and even crazier self- driving cars in China wow yeah**29:55**okay let's go let's go byd like you're up against some serious competition and it's not**30:00**exactly um a fair game maybe or there might be complications to that game um**30:06**we had a long conversation about China and I said to you wow we're burning a lot of money there what do you what's**30:13**the strategy here let me just hear it from you and uh you said we're we're going for gold yeah but I mean there's a**30:19**lot of fun there I mean look the thing about doing business in China is it**30:24**forces you to rethink everything everything like if you go into China**30:30**thinking you got it you're going to get your ass handed to you you have to start**30:36**first principles Bottoms Up um let's see where could I go with this um look we**30:43**tell me tell everybody the strategy hey we're going for gold but they're silver and and you how you looked at the world**30:49**in that regard yeah yeah so I'll get there is that we so a lot of times when**30:54**you go in ENT China they're basically somebody's going you got to have a partner if you just go and you do your**31:00**first exploration trip they' be like you got to get a partner they're like 50/50 blah blah blah and I'm like why nobody**31:06**could tell me why so then we just went on our own and started building something and we never saw on the ground**31:14**we never saw bias we were treated fairly on the**31:20**ground um but at some point what I'd say is the**31:26**China war went Global and what what I mean by that is the Chinese government I**31:32**think it was safe there was a there's some there's some I think it were called safe**31:38**like a it was like The Sovereign wealth of China cic there's like a few things like that they started investing**31:44**hundreds of millions and billions of dollars in all of our competitors globally to drain us of money so that it**31:52**was harder to compete in China they made apple and I'd love to have a**32:00**discussion with Tim at some point we had some interesting words for each other at this point but they made**32:06**Apple uh invest a billion dollars in Dee and apple doesn't invest anything in anybody no that's not their like what**32:13**was he protecting there there's something going on so whole really amazing story there holy**32:19**cow anyways uh the Chinese War went Global and so that's when we had to go**32:25**from going for the goal to making sure we got the silver and**32:32**that's when we started negotiating with de to basically say we had 20% of the of the overall entity of the**32:40**merged entity uh but in order to do that in China that's when we actually had to push our spend super hard because they**32:47**had to be scared so I think at the peak uh right be right as we were**32:54**negotiating the term sheet we pushed we were burning I think it**32:59**was $75 million a week it's a big number yeah that was**33:07**that yeah and but it but we knew we had the deal**33:12**but we only have the deal if they're scared right this is a poker so our market share was skyrocketing as we did**33:20**this they're pissed and tripping and then ail**33:26**who's negot the deal is like just chain smoking**33:33**yeah but that's how you get a deal done in China right uh and that turned out to**33:38**be there it is um that's that's your wartime CEO right there um that deal we**33:47**had invested millions in ch billions in China at that point and I think we I think we invested yeah we probably were**33:53**around a billion billion and a half and the DD St at the time when deal got done was we at 891 yeah something like that**34:00**so we turned a bill and a half into eight or nine I can't remember the exact math but it's something like that uh**34:05**let's talk about in like two years yeah let's talk about when you got atin UTravis reflects on getting ousted as CEO of Uber and his future**34:12**this was heartbreaking crushing brutal um you fought hard to**34:19**remain in the seat I got out there and did what I could on the Press front to**34:24**try to defend you and and try to keep you in the seat but we failed yeah uh**34:30**and it was brutal and it was particularly hard on you because you put your soul into this company yeah well look I think there's a**34:37**little bit more I mean uh you know like if an investor is**34:43**running a political Oppo campaign against you for six months sort of**34:49**generating a crisis every week for six months straight it's going to wear you down and then you know my**34:58**this one's hard your mom passed I**35:05**know I was there with you no no it's all good with you but that's that's when**35:11**they went in for the kill uh that I just couldn't hang yeah bottom line I just**35:16**couldn't hang [Applause]**35:24**yeah and yeah it was um it was dark it was dark yeah**35:32**so but look I a lot of people go hey are you pissed off or this thing and I**35:37**say um first I loved it every**35:43**minute I loved every minute but when you fall in love again you don't think about**35:50**the ex very much right Cloud kitchen the X you moved on**35:58**and you put all that in there in in the I I just want to say**36:05**like I am proud of everything you did and and watching you do it and getting**36:10**to be there and witness it I learned so much from you the community learned so**36:15**much from you and I think we all owe like the Playbook I I can tell you the**36:21**impact you had on the Next Generation because you know I never talk about Uber**36:28**I brought it up once or twice never talk I never talk about it I try to keep it lowkey but I brought it up once or twice**36:33**and it was good for my deal flow and I got to see I got to see I got I'm so honored to**36:41**be here I'm so honored to be here too uh but I got to see that famous Uber**36:47**investor and I mean this sincerely the number of entrepreneurs who came to me**36:53**who said I started this company because I watch Travis I watched what he did I**37:00**want to be Travis you inspired that generation along with Elon to say I want**37:06**to operate in the real world I want to build something that has an impact and I**37:11**am willing to fight and have that entrepreneurial Spirit which I'm going to be honest there's a large amount of**37:19**entrepreneurs who don't have the fight in they don't have the dog in them you got the dog in you you got the fight in**37:26**you you know and and that's so rare and that's why you're so successful it's because you're willing to fight the**37:32**fight yeah**37:40**um you know look we just saw the Olympics and I know I made that marathoner analogy before but like every**37:46**one of those gold medalists they got the dog in them there's no way no other way**37:53**um we're just playing a different sport and I think the you know some of the interesting parts about this sport is**37:59**that it's it's not just an individual thing it's a it's a massive team and**38:05**there's stakeholders in cities and citizens and and all that um it's just**38:11**fun you know like a lot of folks go look you did the Uber thing why are you doing it again I mean you catched in a lot of**38:18**chips you could be just chilling I'm like look Serena keeps getting on the court she's totally badass why is she**38:24**doing it right you know or take your favorite star of anything yeah LeBron's in his 40**38:31**what he's 40 now and he he's looks great out there so it's because they have a love of the game and it's not just**38:37**Showtime that day yeah it's everything behind the scenes it's working with**38:42**people especially in this sport like again individual stuff is a little different like you got to I like the**38:47**magic of working with magical people doing it as a crew is where all the good**38:54**stuff happens and they and you know they all keep coming back you know I've seen a lot of the the the folks who who came**39:01**for a second Tour of Duty with you that speaks volumes as we end here um Dar has done I got to know him yeah um try to**39:08**support the team over there for the Legacy um and he's he's he's done a decent job solid job profitable what's**39:15**that let's go they went from my 75 million a week to profitable I like it well I mean it is great the Legacy we**39:22**always knew it was easily to make it profitable people were saying oh it could never be profitable and you and I would talk and be like we were raise the**39:28**price of dollar profitable like it's not difficult just do you know look there's there's an art to that too it's all good**39:35**yeah um but yeah like like I think Uber's gotten to a great place the**39:41**profitability is there that's means it's going to be around now we they've got to figure out the autonomous thing that's I**39:48**think that's the next big challenge to uh to go after well let me just put it out**39:53**there he's he's going to do his tour and uh his stour is going to end would**40:00**you consider doing what Steve Job did and coming back and merging Cloud**40:05**kitchens with Uber would you consider it if if if the opportunity was there or can can you not**40:13**go you're saying there's a chance can you go home I mean if he this**40:18**would be the Return of the King this would be my dream if you came back I know it's not your dream but it's**40:25**mine could you if Cloud kitchens became part of uber it would be it would be a**40:31**trillion dollar company with you back in that seat would you take the seat again if if it was offered would you consider**40:41**it well I definitely know who my head of comms would be on that note Travis**40:48**Kalen my man I love you great jobEnglish (auto-generated)[20:48Now playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzK9bx3CSPE)**[In conversation with Sergey Brin \| All-In

isn't like  other watches this is a Wi-Fi detho watch allows  **0:06**me to attack Wi-Fi networks as always with these  kinds of devices only attack networks that you  **0:11**have permission to attack or that you own in this  example I've got a phone and a laptop connected to  **0:17**a Wi-Fi network I can access the internet on this  phone I'll also start a continuous ping on this  **0:23**laptop and hopefully you can see that this laptop  is able to Ping google.com but what happens when  **0:30**I start the deor tack so I'll press Start packets  are now being sent into the network de oring  **0:36**clients and what you should see is the laptop can  no longer ping google.com I have deor this laptop  **0:45**from the Wi-Fi network on the phone try and go  to YouTube It's failing because the device has  **0:52**been kicked off the Wi-Fi network if I go and  look at my Wi-Fi settings and try and connect  **0:57**to my Wi-Fi network it says connection pH try  and do that again connection failed devices are  **1:03**no longer able to access the internet because  deor packets are being sent from the watch to  **1:10**the Wi-Fi access point this little access point  right over here kicking clients off the network  **1:15**okay I'll stop the deor attack and what you  should notice hopefully is that pings start  **1:20**succeeding on the laptop and there you go and if  I connect back to the Wi-Fi network I'm able to  **1:25**do that I'm connected now and I should be able  to go to youtube.com which I can under ssids you  **1:34**can specify the clone of access points so you  can see I'm cloning a whole bunch here or you  **1:39**could go with a random mode to create a bunch  of random access points so I'll go back back  **1:44**again deny access beacons and start and what  I'll do here is look at the different Wi-Fi  **1:51**networks and you can see a bunch of fake Wi-Fi  networks exist you could use Rick Roll Nam share**2:02**one caveat with this watch is it only supports  2.4 GHz and not 5 GHz but it's a fantastic little  **2:07**device for testing and demonstration purposes now  this is called the Wi-Fi Commander not a Wi-Fi de  WIFI Commander features and unboxing**2:13**arthor even though it supports de oror tax and  other types of attacks this is very similar once  **2:18**again to this watch that I've demonstrated and  that's very similar to the Wi-Fi nugget as well  **2:24**as the meltronics de author now we're told that  it's got a 1.5 in OLED display it's got a digital  **2:30**Crown control now this was made in England  which is interesting not that much stuff is  **2:34**made in England these days it's a trademark of  code junkies once again I purchased this they  **2:40**are not sponsoring this video they don't know  that I'm even making this video that's enough  **2:44**talking let's unbox this not great packaging if  you like very basic so I got this from Amazon so  **2:50**what we get is the watch and a cable that's it so  that's the unboxing experience nothing fancy but  **2:57**it definitely looks more like a watch than this  does it's got a rub a strap here the strap isn't  **3:02**as nice I mean that doesn't look like a watch  this does so what's interesting is this didn't  **3:06**come with any instructions no instructions at  all but again that looks much more like a watch  **3:11**than what this thing does but the proof of the  pudding is can it actually do what they say it  **3:16**can now there are some issues with this device I  found that the battery doesn't last that long I  **3:20**probably need to charge it for longer before I  continue with the demonstrations also the one  **3:24**that I got the charger is covered here so the  only way to charge this is to pop it up out of  **3:29**the watch and I saw on Amazon the reviews are  quite bad because people have found that it's  **3:33**broken when they've popped it out or popped it  back in but that hasn't been my experience so  **3:38**what you got to do is you got to use a micro USB  cable one is supplied with the watch and now it  **3:43**works as you can see it's powered up properly now  so you could just use it like this but obviously  **3:48**it makes more sense to use this as a watch but  you could just hold it like this in your palm  **3:53**of your hand as an example the power of the Sun  in the palm of my hand an attack Networks in the  **3:59**same way I mean that's a very small device that  could be hidden in your hand this is basically a  **4:04**better version of the previous watch that I've  demonstrated lot lot smaller looks more like  **4:09**a watch than this thing does remember the caveat  with this is it only supports 2.4 GHz that is made  **4:14**clear on the box only 2.4 GHz is supported okay  once you turn the watch on we can see that this  WIFI Commander demo // Scanning access points and Deauthing**4:20**is authorized by space Hardware by code junkies  when it boots up you're probably going to want  **4:25**to scan for Wi-Fi networks and you can scan for  either access points or stations themselves I'm  **4:30**going to scan for both now I have found that this  doesn't always work the display shows that there  **4:35**are zero access points even though it's actually  picking up access points as you can see here it's  **4:40**picked up one station but again that information  is incorrect and I've found that it freezes here  **4:45**so I'm going to Simply press the button again I'm  going to go back and then I'm going to select an  **4:50**access point so select and then access points I'm  going to select the access point that we're going  **4:55**to attack which is the TP Link 2.4 GHz that's  this little TP Link link right over here again  **5:01**only ever attack networks that you own or have  permission to attack so I'm going to select that  **5:07**and I'm going to go back and back again and now  we can deny access so select that option and let's  **5:13**say as an example specify deor and then start de  oring and what you'll notice over here is pings  **5:19**are now timing out so this device can no longer  access the internet so on the phone I'll press go  **5:27**notice no internet is available so we have success  sucessfully deauth to the network you can see that  **5:32**we're sending packets but if I stop that we should  see is on the Windows computer PS should start  **5:38**working again which they do so deor attac has now  been stopped so it's as simple as that once again  **5:44**to launch a deor attac using this watch really  cool that it's so much smaller than the previous  **5:49**generations that I've demonstrated just looks like  a standard sports watch as an example now another  Sending Beacons**5:53**option here is to send beacons I'll select beacons  and then I'll scroll down and start the attack so  **6:02**beacons are being sent out into the network now  now this can be used to fake the real Network or  **6:07**just Spam the air with a bunch of fake networks  so as an example if I go to Wi-Fi and look at the  **6:13**Wi-Fi networks notice I'm suddenly seeing a whole  bunch of TPL link networks many of them these are  **6:21**all fake networks so I'll stop that attack  and go back the reason I was able to do that  **6:27**is under ssids you you can specify the clone of  access points so you can see I'm cloning a whole  **6:33**bunch here or you could go with a random mode to  create a bunch of random access points so I'll go  **6:39**back back again deny access beacons and start and  what I'll do here is look at the different Wi-Fi  **6:47**networks and you can see a bunch of fake Wi-Fi  networks exist you could use Rick Roll name share  **6:57**but as you can see a whole bunch of random ssids  are now being broadcast by the watch now various  Packet monitor**7:05**other options are also supported so I can go back  and then I could do a packet monitor as an example  **7:13**and monitor packets in the network so I can see  what's going on now one of the options with the  WIFI Commander remote connection and control**7:18**watch is you can actually connect to it remotely  so I'm going to select the Ping SSID we told that  **7:25**this is an open network I'm okay with that so  I'm going to connect to to the open network  **7:31**called Pang so I'm now connected to that Network  and in my browser so I'm going to browse to 1921  **7:36**16841 and as you can see a web page is opened we  told that this project is a proof of concept for  **7:42**testing and educational purposes only the watch  uses an esp8266 so we warned that the esp8266 chip  **7:50**and the SDK are not built for real world purposes  they only Built for testing and education purposes  **7:57**and bugs can occur and we told the only use this  against our own networks and devices which I'm  **8:02**doing so you can get more information on GitHub  once again space hun or space chicken if you use  **8:09**the English translation has more information on  his website and I said I've read the notice and  **8:15**what I'll do here is Click reload and that shows  me the various Wi-Fi networks so I can see the  **8:22**encryption used I can see the MAC address I  can see the power whole bunch of information  **8:29**about Wi-Fi networks I can also see client  devices so if I go to ssids I could clone  **8:36**an SSID or add one and I could enable  random mode so at the moment clicking  **8:41**reload a bunch of them are random so a whole  bunch of random ssids I'll remove those and  **8:47**click reload now again you could add your own  ssids here and um do a Rick Roll SSID as an**8:53**example so under deny we could start a deauth  attack we could start a beacon attack we could  **9:02**start probing they also give us a nice  explanation of what each does so Beacon  **9:06**packets are used to advertise access points  deal I've demonstrated where we knock clients  **9:11**off a network and probes are sent by client  devices to ask if a known network is nearby  **9:16**you can use this attack to confuse Wi-Fi trackers  by asking for networks that you specified in the  **9:22**SSID list I could go to settings and reboot the  device as an example or reset it now I've put  Spacehuhntech GitHub, Amazon and product page**9:29**links below to space Hun's GitHub page where you  can get a lot of information about the ESP 82660  **9:35**author that he created fantastic project he gives  you information about how it works I've also put  **9:40**a link to Amazon where I bought this can see the  ratings here are terrible but there is an overview  **9:46**of the device on Amazon and you can have a look  at their website to get more information again I  **9:51**think it's a great little tools for demonstration  purposes it only supports 2.4 GHz however doesn't  **9:57**always work with modern access points even  when they use 2.4 GHz so if you want to stop  How to prevent WIFI pranks**10:02**kids using devices like this from pranking you or  destroying your Wi-Fi network or you want to stop  **10:08**hackers that have more powerful devices that  can do something similar use wp3 with a strong  **10:14**password not just numbers but mixed characters  uppercase lowercase special characters etc make  **10:20**the password long use WPA version 3 use 5 GHz  use 6 GHz hope you enjoyed this video if you  Conclusion**10:27**did please consider liking it please consider  subscribing

welcome back to learn Linux TV  <br>00:00:17.439 as you can probably tell if you're a  <br>00:00:19.279 subscriber of this channel already I'm  <br>00:00:21.119 not in my usual location actually I'm in  <br>00:00:24.439 Sydney Nova Scotia Canada and I'm here  <br>00:00:27.160 at 45 drives headquarters for their  <br>00:00:29.960 Creator Summit and I'm having a ton of  <br>00:00:31.840 fun in fact I'm one of several YouTubers  <br>00:00:34.840 that are here at this event and one of  <br>00:00:37.760 which is Brett he's known on YouTube as  <br>00:00:39.800 raid owl and he's been someone that I've  <br>00:00:42.360 talked to for quite some time now but I  <br>00:00:44.600 haven't had a chance to collaborate with  <br>00:00:46.239 him until now so what I'm going to do in  <br>00:00:48.640 today's video is play back an interview  <br>00:00:50.719 that I had with him where we discussed  <br>00:00:52.920 what's wrong with Linux but before we  <br>00:00:55.280 get to that though I need to make you  <br>00:00:56.879 aware that my merchandise shop the  <br>00:00:58.879 official merch shop for learn Linux TV  <br>00:01:00.800 has been recently updated with brand new  <br>00:01:03.000 products inside the shop you'll find  <br>00:01:05.040 drro themed shirts bags drink wear and  <br>00:01:07.400 more and there's some other surprises  <br>00:01:09.280 there as well for example I've just  <br>00:01:11.200 introduced a mouse pad that doubles as a  <br>00:01:12.920 t-mo cheat sheet how cool is that you  <br>00:01:15.520 could get yourself something really cool  <br>00:01:17.280 and support Linux learning at the same  <br>00:01:19.240 time so it's a win-win thank you so much  <br>00:01:21.799 for supporting learn Linux TV I really  <br>00:01:23.880 appreciate it now at this point what  <br>00:01:25.840 we're going to do is play back the  <br>00:01:27.720 interview that I had with Brett but I  <br>00:01:29.520 want you to be prepared to subscribe to  <br>00:01:32.320 his channel you're going to want to if  <br>00:01:34.000 you haven't already done so anyway let's  <br>00:01:36.119 check out the  <br>00:01:39.680 interview all right so I'm here with  <br>00:01:41.680 Brett from the YouTube channel raid owl  <br>00:01:44.079 how you doing I'm doing good and it's  <br>00:01:46.880 Brett not Brent I want to be clear on  <br>00:01:48.520 that it's Brett not Brent not Brad I've  <br>00:01:51.799 gotten quite a few ones but yeah Brett  <br>00:01:53.719 Brad seems kind of hard to get out of  <br>00:01:55.159 that I don't know how I can't excuse  <br>00:01:56.719 that it's it's I guess it's my accent  <br>00:01:59.320 something with with Southern Accents  <br>00:02:01.520 make it really hard for people to  <br>00:02:02.880 understand Brett like it's it's usually  <br>00:02:04.240 a 50/50 for people to get my name right  <br>00:02:06.240 which is impressive but so we're here at  <br>00:02:09.720 45 drives HQ in Nova Scotia Canada  <br>00:02:13.760 Sydney um and it's been several days  <br>00:02:17.400 like I'm losing track of time like I  <br>00:02:18.760 always do but we've had uh a number of  <br>00:02:21.280 discussions we're brought in for a very  <br>00:02:23.440 specific P purpose um what I was  <br>00:02:25.720 thinking we could do is kind of talk a  <br>00:02:27.760 little bit about your presentation  <br>00:02:30.400 um and then maybe some of the experience  <br>00:02:33.000 that we had here at 45 drives okay yeah  <br>00:02:36.319 so my presentation and and all 45 drives  <br>00:02:40.280 brought us creators in to discuss uh D  <br>00:02:44.959 microsof ification that was the theme of  <br>00:02:47.879 yeah they made sure to make sure you say  <br>00:02:49.959 that right yes it's basically about how  <br>00:02:51.840 do we get from Windows dominating  <br>00:02:54.840 everything to having a more open source  <br>00:02:59.680 uh Community I mean we have one but I  <br>00:03:02.200 mean like how do we get that in the end  <br>00:03:03.519 users hands how do we adjust from being  <br>00:03:05.280 so relying on Windows to right open  <br>00:03:07.959 source so we all did presentations and  <br>00:03:12.080 um mine was on my 30 days of Linux  <br>00:03:17.159 challenge in which I failed uh I have a  <br>00:03:20.040 video on it it was an attempt to use  <br>00:03:23.799 Linux only for 30 days now I'm a I'm a  <br>00:03:26.159 Mac person I use a Macbook for Mac OS  <br>00:03:29.879 obviously and my main workstation is  <br>00:03:32.239 Windows machine and I was like I will  <br>00:03:35.599 put Linux Mint on a Dell xps15 and I  <br>00:03:39.560 will use that for 30 days and I will  <br>00:03:41.760 document my experience um I am not a  <br>00:03:44.400 Linux expert you are a Linux expert um I  <br>00:03:48.720 ran into issues I failed if you watch  <br>00:03:50.959 the video it's in the title everything I  <br>00:03:52.920 I I failed at 22 days um for various  <br>00:03:56.560 reasons and I talked about that and we  <br>00:03:58.040 had a lively discussion about why may be  <br>00:04:01.319 um and yeah it was it was just a good  <br>00:04:03.599 discussion if you want me to go into  <br>00:04:04.920 like some of the specifics yeah I think  <br>00:04:06.480 we will I just wanted to say that um I  <br>00:04:09.000 don't think you failed because you don't  <br>00:04:11.519 fail when you try and I think failure is  <br>00:04:14.319 not even even trying in the first place  <br>00:04:16.680 because I see a lot of times where  <br>00:04:18.160 people will barely try you know they'll  <br>00:04:20.040 try a live CD for an hour right and  <br>00:04:23.040 that's it and then they're done um but  <br>00:04:25.240 that was a serious attempt and I feel  <br>00:04:27.160 like you never know what's at the end of  <br>00:04:28.800 that you could be oh this is the best  <br>00:04:30.520 thing ever I've switched everything or I  <br>00:04:32.240 got to switch back because it didn't  <br>00:04:33.720 work out but um my understanding from  <br>00:04:36.479 your presentation was very reasonable  <br>00:04:38.360 you you ran into some very valid  <br>00:04:40.080 problems that need to be you know kind  <br>00:04:41.960 of looked at I think yeah and it's and  <br>00:04:43.639 it's hard like from a a Linux novice now  <br>00:04:47.000 if you watch my channel like yeah I do  <br>00:04:49.440 uh home labbing stuff and I I am way  <br>00:04:52.600 more um comfortable with using Linux and  <br>00:04:56.960 the Enterprise level as a server  <br>00:04:59.199 obviously where it dominates the market  <br>00:05:01.120 but everyone knows the meme this is the  <br>00:05:03.240 year of the Linux desktop so that's a  <br>00:05:05.199 whole different ball game so yeah I went  <br>00:05:07.560 into it with that in mind and uh the  <br>00:05:11.039 biggest pain points I had were from uh  <br>00:05:15.240 hardware issues whether that be my insta  <br>00:05:18.280 360 webcam deciding to go in earthquake  <br>00:05:21.639 mode in the middle of a live stream wow  <br>00:05:24.400 um sounds like a feature but I don't I  <br>00:05:25.960 don't think it sounds useful it was cool  <br>00:05:28.120 but not what I wanted at the time but  <br>00:05:30.759 yeah I was on Tom Lawrence's stream and  <br>00:05:32.360 it just decided to do that and it's that  <br>00:05:35.880 was a frustrating thing and also because  <br>00:05:37.919 the insta 360 software to control that  <br>00:05:41.360 webcam doesn't exist in Linux it's just  <br>00:05:44.120 you can't get it um that was one issue  <br>00:05:47.600 that was kind of annoying another one  <br>00:05:49.240 was I was having issues with my  <br>00:05:51.720 Thunderbolt dock I would just sometimes  <br>00:05:54.600 decide that yeah we're not going to  <br>00:05:56.120 detect monitors and it's hard to narrow  <br>00:06:00.120 down what is specifically a Linux  <br>00:06:03.039 problem versus what is a Dell problem  <br>00:06:06.280 versus what is a combination of Linux  <br>00:06:08.680 with Dell with uh Thunderbolt with the  <br>00:06:11.120 specific dock type thing and I know in  <br>00:06:14.599 your presentation you you talked about  <br>00:06:16.560 testing hardware and that's probably  <br>00:06:18.120 something I should have uh looked at  <br>00:06:20.479 before doing this and I think that's a  <br>00:06:21.880 valid point because I think I was  <br>00:06:23.520 telling you I when I started this I  <br>00:06:26.039 wanted a laptop and I almost went with a  <br>00:06:28.000 system 76 one which is famously known  <br>00:06:31.280 for you run window or you run Linux on  <br>00:06:33.919 those I was like ah you know for the  <br>00:06:36.039 price I can get a used D  <br>00:06:38.560 xps15 um with you know better specs and  <br>00:06:42.240 so I got that and you know I read a  <br>00:06:43.639 couple of forum posts that it was it  <br>00:06:45.120 worked well with Linux and it was just  <br>00:06:47.360 so many issues and then the second one  <br>00:06:49.199 came down to software like I am heavily  <br>00:06:52.960 reliant on Photoshop and Lightroom  <br>00:06:56.160 Lightroom is one of the main ones that I  <br>00:06:57.639 won't budge on and and when I needed  <br>00:07:00.800 access to some of those pictures that  <br>00:07:03.400 were edited in Lightroom right I did not  <br>00:07:06.440 have them so these are just like a  <br>00:07:09.840 couple of things that just just kept  <br>00:07:12.240 eating at me until you know you got to  <br>00:07:15.680 get work done yeah and so you have to  <br>00:07:17.440 get stuff done and it just boiled over  <br>00:07:20.919 yeah I think so so one of my opinions  <br>00:07:23.840 and and less so with your presentation  <br>00:07:26.039 cuz I think for you it was like  <br>00:07:27.840 switching your workflow over and  <br>00:07:29.039 everything which is  <br>00:07:30.039 kind of how it goes but sometimes when  <br>00:07:33.280 you when people compare the situation  <br>00:07:34.879 with Linux and windows I don't always  <br>00:07:36.240 think it's quite the same comparison for  <br>00:07:38.240 example if you bought an HP laptop that  <br>00:07:41.280 runs windows then in their R&D lab they  <br>00:07:44.520 have made sure that each and every  <br>00:07:46.319 component works and I did Windows  <br>00:07:48.599 Administration for a long time uh one of  <br>00:07:50.639 the things I like to do back then was I  <br>00:07:52.800 would just wipe the manufacturer image  <br>00:07:54.560 from the drive cuz they'd have all this  <br>00:07:55.919 bloatware like you know inkjet ads or  <br>00:07:59.039 whatever it is that are on there so I  <br>00:08:00.720 just put put on the Microsoft image and  <br>00:08:03.879 when I do this I have like five or 10  <br>00:08:07.039 drivers to find but that wasn't that's  <br>00:08:09.319 not a problem because that's just the  <br>00:08:10.919 industry that okay fine I just install  <br>00:08:12.639 the drivers and it's good but when you  <br>00:08:14.919 have HP doing that they put the drivers  <br>00:08:17.680 on and they tested the audio card they  <br>00:08:20.400 tested the Wi-Fi card for Windows and  <br>00:08:24.159 one issue is when we come behind them  <br>00:08:27.440 and then we put Linux on it we become  <br>00:08:30.599 the R&D for Linux at that point because  <br>00:08:33.159 HP decided not to do that and sure they  <br>00:08:35.479 did have a Linux laptop recently that  <br>00:08:37.159 was a really good one but um I think  <br>00:08:40.719 sometimes the experiment can be  <br>00:08:42.320 different if you you know have a Windows  <br>00:08:46.360 laptop that's shipped with Windows and  <br>00:08:48.240 you have a laptop that's shipped with  <br>00:08:49.720 Linux now you're not guaranteed to have  <br>00:08:51.600 a perfect experience cuz if the  <br>00:08:53.080 manufacturer did a poor job you're still  <br>00:08:55.279 run into the same problem but it it's  <br>00:08:58.399 kind of like I feel like Linux is  <br>00:09:00.920 marketed as the everything OS too much  <br>00:09:03.360 where people say oh it runs on  <br>00:09:04.640 everything you should install it and  <br>00:09:06.120 they brag it up and I love it but I feel  <br>00:09:08.399 like they're bragging it too much and  <br>00:09:09.920 they're kind of setting people up for  <br>00:09:11.360 this expectation that may not align to  <br>00:09:13.440 reality yeah um one thing uh I I found  <br>00:09:18.360 out when doing this and I'd be curious  <br>00:09:21.560 to know how true you think this is is  <br>00:09:24.360 that I found when asking for help or  <br>00:09:27.440 trying to get general advice on some the  <br>00:09:29.560 issues I was having um whether they'd be  <br>00:09:33.200 like simple things like U mounting  <br>00:09:35.600 Network shares like I I just want to do  <br>00:09:37.600 that in the gooey like I can do in  <br>00:09:38.839 Windows and it's almost like overly  <br>00:09:41.480 complicated to do it and when I asked  <br>00:09:44.640 for that I was almost like made fun of  <br>00:09:46.920 because I wanted it in the goey and it  <br>00:09:48.880 was like the Linux I want to say the  <br>00:09:51.120 Linux Community cuz that's such a  <br>00:09:52.839 stereotype but certain users in the  <br>00:09:55.040 Linux Community almost fetishize making  <br>00:09:58.839 things different  <br>00:10:00.240 like they take pride in how difficult  <br>00:10:02.519 something is to do and if you want to  <br>00:10:03.920 make it easier it's almost like oh  <br>00:10:06.519 you're not built for Linux then buddy  <br>00:10:08.360 you better go back to to Windows do you  <br>00:10:11.680 see that I do there's so much toxicity  <br>00:10:15.160 in the Linux community and I don't want  <br>00:10:16.720 to make it out to be that every  <br>00:10:18.040 community that serves a Linux  <br>00:10:19.800 distribution is bad I don't want to say  <br>00:10:21.480 that at all but there are some out there  <br>00:10:23.360 I won't disparage them and name them but  <br>00:10:25.760 what I find is that you have helpful  <br>00:10:28.279 communities you have have toxic  <br>00:10:29.920 communities and for an example in my  <br>00:10:32.880 forums an rtfm response is a banable  <br>00:10:37.200 that's banable you are not allowed to  <br>00:10:38.880 say that on my forums because my mindset  <br>00:10:41.360 is either answer the person's question  <br>00:10:43.839 or don't right you know CU I get upset  <br>00:10:46.800 when someone gets you know rtfm like you  <br>00:10:48.959 didn't have to respond because number  <br>00:10:51.839 one you're going to trigger their  <br>00:10:53.920 opposition which is not going to get  <br>00:10:55.800 them to comply they are not going to  <br>00:10:57.680 search like you're telling them to  <br>00:10:59.320 they're not going to check the manual  <br>00:11:00.760 like you're telling them to you've  <br>00:11:02.519 pissed them off that's the only thing  <br>00:11:04.079 that you've you've done and we need to  <br>00:11:05.800 and I understand that it sometimes is so  <br>00:11:08.680 annoying to answer the same questions  <br>00:11:10.480 over and over and over again but that's  <br>00:11:12.279 what we have to do and we have to do it  <br>00:11:14.839 with a smile on her face and anything  <br>00:11:16.959 else is doing a disservice say like why  <br>00:11:19.000 are you on a forum then if you're not  <br>00:11:20.360 there to answer questions like it's yeah  <br>00:11:23.040 it's like it's like this and and the  <br>00:11:24.760 thing is if you want to help out in a  <br>00:11:26.160 community answering questions in the  <br>00:11:28.120 Forum is not the only thing you can do  <br>00:11:29.839 so if that's something that's rubbing  <br>00:11:31.040 you the wrong way maybe you feel like  <br>00:11:32.360 it's aggravating you or something and  <br>00:11:34.160 you might give a response like that you  <br>00:11:35.880 could maybe take a break from it and go  <br>00:11:37.480 help somewhere else behind closed doors  <br>00:11:39.519 maybe documentation if you're a coder  <br>00:11:41.320 maybe you could do that so I just don't  <br>00:11:43.480 get why people are are snarky like that  <br>00:11:46.519 when why are you there yeah and it's  <br>00:11:48.959 it's I I've seen it before and I've been  <br>00:11:50.839 on both sides and and I get it that's  <br>00:11:53.639 some questions are frustrating to answer  <br>00:11:56.000 over and over and some may seem you know  <br>00:11:58.720 really simple but from the other  <br>00:12:00.680 person's perspective you don't know how  <br>00:12:02.279 much courage it took them to walk into  <br>00:12:04.920 that forum and know that they are going  <br>00:12:06.399 to sound dumb asking a basic question  <br>00:12:09.519 right and I know some people some people  <br>00:12:11.120 are just annoying some people come in  <br>00:12:12.600 and refuse to get the help that they  <br>00:12:14.880 need and it's just at some point you  <br>00:12:16.920 know if you have to walk away and say  <br>00:12:18.720 sorry I can't help like that's fine like  <br>00:12:21.800 some people are just like that we get  <br>00:12:23.600 that but yeah saying read read the  <br>00:12:26.600 manual like that that's frust in and  <br>00:12:30.000 very discouraging and you only get one  <br>00:12:32.000 opportunity to make a first impression  <br>00:12:34.000 true so if someone's coming in here and  <br>00:12:35.440 trying Linux for the first time or  <br>00:12:36.760 you're distro for the first time and  <br>00:12:38.160 that's the response they get you think  <br>00:12:40.480 they're ever going to come back and no  <br>00:12:42.240 and and we are the marketing firm for  <br>00:12:44.519 Linux I need everyone to understand this  <br>00:12:46.480 like there's no one company yes there's  <br>00:12:48.880 big companies behind distributions but  <br>00:12:51.560 there's no Microsoft that owns  <br>00:12:54.040 everything and makes all the rules it's  <br>00:12:55.680 a community project we celebrate the  <br>00:12:58.560 fact that there's all this all these  <br>00:13:00.079 different um different you know  <br>00:13:01.600 distributions we celebrate the choice  <br>00:13:03.760 but then we flame people for using the  <br>00:13:06.920 choice like we say oh Linux is great  <br>00:13:08.839 because we have a bunch of distributions  <br>00:13:10.959 but then when they go to post a message  <br>00:13:12.360 why are you using that distribution  <br>00:13:13.800 you're stupid you should be using that  <br>00:13:15.040 distribution so at one point we're we're  <br>00:13:17.040 bragging about all the choice with Linux  <br>00:13:21.240 and when people exercise that choice  <br>00:13:23.440 then you know some people kind of don't  <br>00:13:25.120 don't seem to like that very much yeah  <br>00:13:26.959 and I one comment I got a lot on my  <br>00:13:28.880 video video  <br>00:13:30.560 was uh the Dr chose it doesn't matter  <br>00:13:33.120 what you chose the dro doesn't matter  <br>00:13:35.320 and I feel like to an extent that's kind  <br>00:13:37.639 of true but also not true it it's going  <br>00:13:41.360 to a point where the distribution won't  <br>00:13:42.959 matter at some point in the future we're  <br>00:13:44.920 not there yet it it's possible that the  <br>00:13:47.000 distribution doesn't matter for a  <br>00:13:48.360 particular person for example if their  <br>00:13:51.279 apps all just so happen to be within  <br>00:13:53.440 flathub they're good right they it  <br>00:13:55.920 doesn't matter what distribution they're  <br>00:13:57.199 on at that point they can install their  <br>00:13:58.720 favorite applications but if one of  <br>00:14:00.199 their favorite applications is not there  <br>00:14:02.560 then they have to go get it a different  <br>00:14:04.040 way so we have the Frameworks and we  <br>00:14:05.800 have flat pack we have wh and all these  <br>00:14:07.519 different things that are really going  <br>00:14:09.120 to make things better but they're not  <br>00:14:12.079 being developed fast enough and I'm not  <br>00:14:14.680 going to disparage the programmers here  <br>00:14:16.800 because I don't really think it's their  <br>00:14:18.040 fault what I feel like is you have  <br>00:14:19.759 system D Wayland flat pack snap insert  <br>00:14:23.839 name of thing here you know people are  <br>00:14:26.079 really passionate about developing this  <br>00:14:28.480 and they think that they're doing a  <br>00:14:29.639 great thing I think they're doing a  <br>00:14:30.800 great thing and then when they release  <br>00:14:32.440 it people are like I hate snaps I hate  <br>00:14:34.959 flat packs I hate system D I hate  <br>00:14:36.920 Wayland And that's think about it like  <br>00:14:38.759 this you get a a developer that's  <br>00:14:40.639 excited and their spirits and they're  <br>00:14:42.720 going to get discouraged so here we are  <br>00:14:44.480 expecting these Technologies to grow  <br>00:14:47.279 faster so it can get us there but what  <br>00:14:49.440 we're doing is we're just slamming the  <br>00:14:52.680 Developers for their decisions to a  <br>00:14:54.480 toxic level there I mean some have  <br>00:14:56.839 received death threats in the past I  <br>00:14:58.560 mean it gets to be a point where if I  <br>00:15:01.079 don't know if it were me and I was one  <br>00:15:02.959 of those developers I don't think I  <br>00:15:04.839 would write code as fast because I  <br>00:15:07.000 wouldn't be as excited to do it knowing  <br>00:15:09.079 that once I'm finished people are still  <br>00:15:11.440 going to be upset with me and I feel  <br>00:15:13.000 like that really slows things down a lot  <br>00:15:15.279 yeah it's that and it's also I think we  <br>00:15:17.279 discussed it in in one of our meetings  <br>00:15:19.440 um we might discussed it multiple times  <br>00:15:21.320 was um releasing things before they're  <br>00:15:24.880 ready because it goes back to you only  <br>00:15:27.000 get one first impression like right want  <br>00:15:29.160 this feature uh okay uh let's develop it  <br>00:15:32.519 crank it out there oh wait it doesn't  <br>00:15:34.639 actually work that well and now that  <br>00:15:37.240 feature is just known as being buggy and  <br>00:15:40.440 crap reputation is everything reputation  <br>00:15:42.959 especially when you have all these  <br>00:15:44.959 different dros in  <br>00:15:47.519 Windows you can get a bad reputation for  <br>00:15:49.920 a certain feature but it doesn't matter  <br>00:15:51.639 because you're still going to use  <br>00:15:52.560 Windows like that's that's what happens  <br>00:15:55.680 if you use Windows and you're used to it  <br>00:15:57.319 you're used to having these things  <br>00:15:58.560 happen but it doesn't matter cuz what  <br>00:16:00.000 else are you going to do in lenux if a  <br>00:16:03.480 drro that is promising that is making  <br>00:16:06.199 advances  <br>00:16:07.319 but they just for some reason or another  <br>00:16:09.920 whether that's self-inflicted or from  <br>00:16:11.600 some other means gets a negative  <br>00:16:13.639 reputation right people are just going  <br>00:16:15.600 to hop to a different one and that  <br>00:16:17.440 that's right I mean we look at a long  <br>00:16:19.639 time ago I mean I was a fan of KD for  <br>00:16:21.560 for a long time I still am even though  <br>00:16:23.160 it's not my daily driver I still like it  <br>00:16:24.480 a lot um but there was a point where I  <br>00:16:26.360 was using it full-time and I remember  <br>00:16:28.199 when KD for 4.0 came out it was  <br>00:16:30.839 extremely buggy you could barely keep it  <br>00:16:33.000 running um almost nothing worked well  <br>00:16:36.000 and then you know it's a 4.0 release  <br>00:16:38.399 it's considered stable and then the KD  <br>00:16:41.319 is like well you're not supposed to use  <br>00:16:42.759 it yet wait till like I forgot what  <br>00:16:44.600 version I'm like well you released it as  <br>00:16:47.160 stable so I'm I don't care if you're not  <br>00:16:49.240 feature complete but if you're crashing  <br>00:16:51.319 I have a problem and this is everyone's  <br>00:16:53.920 workflow now obviously I feel like KDE  <br>00:16:56.399 is great now I mean I'm sure they  <br>00:16:57.839 learned their lesson I have heard very  <br>00:16:59.319 many complaints lately but there's still  <br>00:17:01.399 people out there that might still feel  <br>00:17:03.279 that's the case there's people that  <br>00:17:04.520 think Ubuntu still has the Amazon icon  <br>00:17:08.520 and that that it's spying on them which  <br>00:17:10.280 wasn't true but they took that away a  <br>00:17:11.720 long time ago but people would swear  <br>00:17:13.679 it's still there it's like the once a  <br>00:17:15.720 software project in the Linux Community  <br>00:17:17.480 gets a bad reputation it's extremely  <br>00:17:20.000 hard for them to get rid of that and you  <br>00:17:22.359 see that with butter FS when they  <br>00:17:24.439 released 1.0 which was not feature  <br>00:17:27.160 complete now butter s probably won't  <br>00:17:30.000 have a single chance of taking over ZFS  <br>00:17:32.200 I think it's a great technology I'm not  <br>00:17:33.559 saying it's bad but but yeah it's it's  <br>00:17:35.960 wonderful but now that we called it 1.0  <br>00:17:38.760 it's got this reputation of the ZFS file  <br>00:17:41.320 system that barely works when all they  <br>00:17:44.559 did was call it 1.0 and I feel like once  <br>00:17:47.200 that happened development of butter FS  <br>00:17:49.600 slows down and the only thing I could  <br>00:17:51.760 think of is that it discourages people  <br>00:17:53.480 to hear all that backlash so one example  <br>00:17:55.880 I have right now is not specifically a  <br>00:17:57.240 Linux drro but that conversation  <br>00:17:59.320 reminded me of um I don't know who  <br>00:18:02.159 watching is um familiar with uh ice ice  <br>00:18:06.799 whale the zema board zema blade um zma  <br>00:18:10.240 Cube those zema products um wow yeah I'm  <br>00:18:12.960 not but I want to be at some point  <br>00:18:14.799 they're uh they're little like um sbcs  <br>00:18:18.240 or x86 they make a Zemo board and a zema  <br>00:18:20.760 blade they're like these little x86 like  <br>00:18:22.960 a Raspberry Pi that can boot from a flat  <br>00:18:24.720 from a USB key basically yeah it's just  <br>00:18:26.600 a little x86 N1 100 board and now they  <br>00:18:29.640 have a  <br>00:18:30.760 um they have a zma cube and it's a big  <br>00:18:33.480 nest it's like your sonology or qap it's  <br>00:18:37.039 just a and they developed their own uh  <br>00:18:39.600 little operating system for it called  <br>00:18:41.200 zma OS and they've been developing it  <br>00:18:44.159 for over a year but they've never  <br>00:18:46.760 released it as a 1.0 and I'm in the  <br>00:18:50.640 middle of reviewing one right now and it  <br>00:18:54.679 has a lot of issues but it's also not  <br>00:18:57.480 right a 1.0 so can't sit here and say  <br>00:19:00.080 you know this is bad like I mean I can  <br>00:19:02.600 say I can point out all the flaws  <br>00:19:04.240 definitely point but I can't say like  <br>00:19:06.520 guys this isn't a released product when  <br>00:19:08.640 it's released then I can give my final  <br>00:19:11.440 judgment on it as a whole and I feel  <br>00:19:13.919 like if more dros did that or with their  <br>00:19:16.280 features at least like this is ready  <br>00:19:18.520 this is stable we marked it as stable if  <br>00:19:20.640 you want another feature look at our  <br>00:19:22.400 road map we are working on it but I feel  <br>00:19:25.200 like that's not the case I think we need  <br>00:19:27.240 to have more people from a drro agnostic  <br>00:19:31.720 perspective catalog the hardware and the  <br>00:19:34.559 compatibility to have a drro agnostic  <br>00:19:37.000 compatibility database I'm not saying  <br>00:19:39.080 that that doesn't exist already I'm  <br>00:19:40.679 pretty sure that it does but we need  <br>00:19:43.559 something that is you know paid  <br>00:19:46.159 attention to that's being developed that  <br>00:19:48.679 is you know moving forward if we just  <br>00:19:50.919 had the one place that people could  <br>00:19:52.240 check then you know maybe you'll type in  <br>00:19:54.679 your Nvidia card and it might say works  <br>00:19:56.640 with a vuntu 2404 doesn't work with  <br>00:19:59.120 20204 and then it has that but one issue  <br>00:20:03.000 is we have all these distributions  <br>00:20:04.520 developing separately and that's not  <br>00:20:05.880 really a problem because they should be  <br>00:20:07.200 able to do that the whole point is to  <br>00:20:08.320 have a distribution of your own but  <br>00:20:10.280 they're also solving problems  <br>00:20:12.480 independently that they could help other  <br>00:20:14.440 distribution solve things that you know  <br>00:20:16.880 if if you're going through an issue with  <br>00:20:18.360 your dock on your  <br>00:20:20.480 distribution um if your distribution  <br>00:20:22.440 fixes it maybe they'll let another  <br>00:20:23.840 distribution know what they had to do to  <br>00:20:25.200 get that done and then the next thing  <br>00:20:26.480 you know if they Upstream it if it's a  <br>00:20:27.919 Linux kernel ISS you then it goes there  <br>00:20:29.400 everyone benefits but who's doing this  <br>00:20:32.960 you know like like we need we need  <br>00:20:34.440 someone like obviously we're expecting  <br>00:20:36.159 users to do it but they're not doing it  <br>00:20:38.039 yeah I think it's like a double-edged  <br>00:20:39.559 sword with Linux being so customizable  <br>00:20:43.320 and the fact that there's so many to  <br>00:20:44.440 choose from that's a good thing but on  <br>00:20:46.960 the other side you're splitting your  <br>00:20:50.840 developers and your talent into all  <br>00:20:54.600 these different pieces when imagine if  <br>00:20:56.679 you I know this isn't going to happen  <br>00:20:58.240 cuz it's not the nature of Linux or or  <br>00:21:01.159 open source but imagine if you just took  <br>00:21:02.799 those people and had a standardize one  <br>00:21:04.159 drro we're going to work together on  <br>00:21:05.919 just this one and we're going to make  <br>00:21:07.480 Linux yeah good for this one drro in a  <br>00:21:12.039 perfect world yeah that'd be great but  <br>00:21:14.039 that's not going to happen because the  <br>00:21:16.440 the reason people get into Linux is  <br>00:21:17.919 because they don't want to be forced  <br>00:21:19.279 into right a bucket they want that that  <br>00:21:22.159 freedom and and that was a big part of  <br>00:21:24.360 the you know the conversation here at 45  <br>00:21:26.520 drives we we talk about things like even  <br>00:21:28.919 during one of the meetings um PowerPoint  <br>00:21:31.840 froze for someone multiple times they  <br>00:21:35.039 we've had a update didn't we have an  <br>00:21:36.799 update window come up I could have sworn  <br>00:21:38.120 we did we had some kind of message come  <br>00:21:39.400 up a few different times and it was  <br>00:21:41.840 funny we were talking about how Windows  <br>00:21:45.120 is disruptive often to the users while  <br>00:21:48.159 it was actually showing disruption  <br>00:21:50.080 toward us while we were talking but  <br>00:21:52.919 that's kind of the main point that we  <br>00:21:54.240 get to when we say d Microsoft and  <br>00:21:56.480 personally my opinion is everyone should  <br>00:21:58.799 use the operating system that that works  <br>00:22:00.760 for them I want a future where someone  <br>00:22:04.360 goes to Best Buy and they see a Windows  <br>00:22:07.080 laptop they see a Macbook and they see a  <br>00:22:09.679 Linux laptop I want them to have a hard  <br>00:22:12.120 choice I want them to be there for a  <br>00:22:13.679 while and really have a hard decision  <br>00:22:15.720 because all three are just that good but  <br>00:22:18.320 the reality is um sometimes it's just  <br>00:22:22.000 hard to push something forward when  <br>00:22:25.240 other distrib all the distributions are  <br>00:22:27.080 each going their own Direction I feel  <br>00:22:28.600 that makes it tougher a lot yeah and  <br>00:22:30.640 it's I think we discussed this that was  <br>00:22:34.679 like we're it I think we were kind of  <br>00:22:37.240 split on this one where um feeling about  <br>00:22:41.080 the end user how much are they actually  <br>00:22:43.799 tied to Windows and we were like I don't  <br>00:22:46.320 think the end user really cares too much  <br>00:22:48.760 about the operating system as long as  <br>00:22:50.200 they're guaranteed that it'll work and  <br>00:22:52.520 and Linux hasn't proven that it'll just  <br>00:22:55.279 work because the connotation behind it  <br>00:22:57.720 is that it's weird because it's it's  <br>00:23:00.400 both it'll work on everything which I  <br>00:23:02.559 know isn't true but it has that kind of  <br>00:23:04.720 people say that people say that but and  <br>00:23:07.880 it doesn't work so it's got both this  <br>00:23:10.279 it'll work on everything but it doesn't  <br>00:23:12.240 work and it's it's so confusing that the  <br>00:23:15.200 average person they're never going to  <br>00:23:17.640 they're never going to use that over Mac  <br>00:23:20.320 or Windows if if that is the perception  <br>00:23:23.679 so and it wasn't a very popular opinion  <br>00:23:26.960 but I still stand by it that people  <br>00:23:29.000 don't like change you know if someone  <br>00:23:31.760 switches to Linux or even for just a  <br>00:23:34.279 little while because you maybe because  <br>00:23:35.760 you recommended it there's a very good  <br>00:23:38.159 chance that they're doing it because  <br>00:23:39.240 they love you they're doing it because  <br>00:23:40.559 they're supporting you they're they're  <br>00:23:42.200 helping you they're being a team player  <br>00:23:44.320 but changing an operating system is just  <br>00:23:47.480 not a mindset anyone has when they go to  <br>00:23:50.159 an appliance store they buy a fridge  <br>00:23:51.919 they don't care what's inside the fridge  <br>00:23:55.080 they just want their soda to be cold  <br>00:23:56.760 that's all they care about right so  <br>00:23:59.120 imagine if we go up to somebody and say  <br>00:24:01.120 Hey I want to change the operating  <br>00:24:02.480 system on your fridge it's going to cool  <br>00:24:04.039 your food better what um and I know  <br>00:24:06.440 that's a stupid example but if you think  <br>00:24:08.120 about it when you have a person they buy  <br>00:24:10.400 a computer it's an appliance they think  <br>00:24:12.279 of it like they're buying a stove a  <br>00:24:14.480 refrigerator a dishwasher they're buying  <br>00:24:16.360 a thing that does a thing and and that's  <br>00:24:18.960 all it is to them we come in change the  <br>00:24:21.320 operating system many of these people  <br>00:24:22.799 didn't even know that was something that  <br>00:24:24.000 you could do in the first place and  <br>00:24:26.520 they're going to feel anxiety when you  <br>00:24:28.440 recommend this because what you're  <br>00:24:29.960 telling them is I would love for an  <br>00:24:32.440 opportunity you know an opportunity to  <br>00:24:34.440 change the way you do everything  <br>00:24:35.919 wouldn't that be so cool yeah and then  <br>00:24:38.480 and then they don't want to get on board  <br>00:24:39.720 with it but um my opinion on Linux is  <br>00:24:43.240 that Linux on the desktop will only take  <br>00:24:45.919 off when a flagship desktop not marketed  <br>00:24:49.880 as a Linux desktop but does have Linux  <br>00:24:52.559 installed takes off then that would be  <br>00:24:55.720 something that could happen but it's  <br>00:24:57.799 just I mean look at Chrome OS like right  <br>00:25:00.880 Linux bace it doesn't say Android yeah  <br>00:25:03.600 yeah it's not Linux Android it's not  <br>00:25:06.039 Linux Chrome OS but it is popular people  <br>00:25:10.240 like it I wonder how how many people you  <br>00:25:12.279 think actually know that when they're  <br>00:25:14.000 using their Chromebook or their Android  <br>00:25:15.880 that it's based on Linux what percentage  <br>00:25:17.880 of people I mean I leg don't know I mean  <br>00:25:20.640 I really don't know but I I can't  <br>00:25:22.399 imagine that many people know or even  <br>00:25:24.039 care to know yeah so imagine yeah like  <br>00:25:25.840 you said if there's this third operating  <br>00:25:27.480 system that comes out out that looks as  <br>00:25:30.480 good as Mac OS and it has the  <br>00:25:32.600 compatibility of things with  <br>00:25:34.919 Windows people would be like okay I mean  <br>00:25:37.960 not overnight well I disagree I mean I I  <br>00:25:40.640 see your point but I feel like people  <br>00:25:43.039 will never switch to Windows I mean to  <br>00:25:45.320 Linux because they they're people are  <br>00:25:47.880 that averse to change it's really hard  <br>00:25:49.240 for us to understand this because we get  <br>00:25:51.880 excited when new technology comes out  <br>00:25:53.559 because there's new features there new  <br>00:25:54.919 technologies and things to learn but  <br>00:25:56.840 they don't get excited about those  <br>00:25:58.080 things things and I just feel like we're  <br>00:26:01.039 pitching something to a market see apple  <br>00:26:04.480 ships everything as you know I hate to  <br>00:26:06.120 use them as as an example but they  <br>00:26:08.279 they're very good at selling things  <br>00:26:10.080 they're extremely good at this and in  <br>00:26:11.840 marketing um how many times have you  <br>00:26:13.919 seen them Market oh check out our new  <br>00:26:16.039 version of  <br>00:26:17.399 BSD so many times right it's every  <br>00:26:20.200 commercial oh BSD o right no it's Mac OS  <br>00:26:23.480 they're selling a Mac computer with Mac  <br>00:26:26.559 OS and it it does well because they're  <br>00:26:29.360 selling a product meanwhile I feel like  <br>00:26:32.080 we're trying to sell an idea to people  <br>00:26:34.679 we should be selling a product yeah and  <br>00:26:36.679 I think it it's going to boil down to  <br>00:26:38.679 and this is getting further in yeah into  <br>00:26:40.960 the discussion but like you're used to  <br>00:26:44.720 like I said you're not you don't want to  <br>00:26:45.720 change so you're going to use what  <br>00:26:46.840 you're used to so how do we get the  <br>00:26:48.880 younger generation more used to using  <br>00:26:51.919 Linux if that's what we want to succeed  <br>00:26:54.840 moving forward if that's how we want  <br>00:26:56.600 Linux to gain more users but I feel like  <br>00:26:59.960 what's popular these days is you know  <br>00:27:03.279 this what you have in your pocket this  <br>00:27:04.760 is what people use as their main device  <br>00:27:08.600 so Y which I don't know is if that hurts  <br>00:27:11.880 or helps because I feel like when I was  <br>00:27:14.760 growing up we didn't have this if you  <br>00:27:17.360 wanted technology you got on the  <br>00:27:18.799 computer or went to the library cuz you  <br>00:27:20.799 couldn't afford it yeah and now it's  <br>00:27:22.640 like there's this distinct separation  <br>00:27:24.919 between my computer and my phone I may  <br>00:27:27.679 do more stuff on my phone but when I  <br>00:27:29.000 want to do something I get on the  <br>00:27:30.480 computer and now it's like well you know  <br>00:27:32.760 this is my phone and that's my computer  <br>00:27:34.399 if that's a Linux one then sure but I do  <br>00:27:36.840 most of my stuff here so I think one  <br>00:27:40.320 it's going to be a weird Next Generation  <br>00:27:43.679 10 20 years that's for sure I I can  <br>00:27:46.880 Envision someday the desktop completely  <br>00:27:49.799 dying and laptops being the only thing  <br>00:27:51.799 now now when I say this I want to be  <br>00:27:53.039 clear I do not see gaming PCs dying okay  <br>00:27:55.919 when I'm talking about desktops dying I  <br>00:27:57.640 mean for the people that don't game like  <br>00:27:59.279 the people that you know are are working  <br>00:28:00.880 in an office or you know their computers  <br>00:28:03.240 in Appliance they don't care people will  <br>00:28:04.559 still be building computers and buying  <br>00:28:05.919 video cards but I I do feel like at a  <br>00:28:07.720 certain point other than that the  <br>00:28:10.480 desktop is going to die and then as the  <br>00:28:12.760 portable devices which run Linux easier  <br>00:28:15.320 There's an opportunity there for Linux  <br>00:28:17.120 to come up with another device the  <br>00:28:18.679 desktop has already been one for so long  <br>00:28:20.559 it's really hard to to go back  <br>00:28:22.440 retroactively and win it this time but  <br>00:28:24.120 if you know we saw with netbooks Linux  <br>00:28:26.120 was there at the beginning and at that  <br>00:28:27.720 point a lot of people don't realize this  <br>00:28:29.320 a lot of people had a Linux laptop what  <br>00:28:32.559 happened tablets tablets came out  <br>00:28:35.640 everyone thought netbooks were going to  <br>00:28:36.919 be the thing it looked like Linux was  <br>00:28:38.880 actually taking off and next thing you  <br>00:28:40.840 know you know we have Android tablets  <br>00:28:42.720 that just we switched to that we  <br>00:28:44.240 switched to the the iPad and netbooks  <br>00:28:46.600 Fade Into Obscurity but what we saw was  <br>00:28:49.120 a new device form factor coming up Linux  <br>00:28:52.240 being there first and gaining from that  <br>00:28:54.640 popularity I think that's what we need  <br>00:28:56.559 this time yeah good example that we're  <br>00:28:58.240 seeing right now is the steam deck M  <br>00:29:01.039 valve gave the customers a feature and a  <br>00:29:06.080 reason to buy a product and the  <br>00:29:08.480 operating system was secondary you're  <br>00:29:10.519 buying this to game you don't care how  <br>00:29:14.880 it does it but it's running Linux so you  <br>00:29:18.919 know everyone's seen that spike in the  <br>00:29:21.320 amount of users using Linux just through  <br>00:29:23.480 Steam deck sales because of how popular  <br>00:29:25.440 it's gotten and I think if you can  <br>00:29:29.080 do that in a  <br>00:29:30.799 more I don't even know I don't want to  <br>00:29:32.600 say corporate world but more just like  <br>00:29:34.600 gener generic end user world like this  <br>00:29:37.960 thing it's super easy to watch YouTube  <br>00:29:40.480 and browse your mail and that's  <br>00:29:42.320 something I guess you see with Chrome OS  <br>00:29:43.960 I guess that's the appeal to it and they  <br>00:29:45.360 don't care what it is like you you give  <br>00:29:48.159 someone something they don't care that's  <br>00:29:49.399 Chrome OS they don't care that's Mac OS  <br>00:29:51.320 it it works so until L Linux  <br>00:29:55.240 distribution can get there right that  <br>00:29:58.640 is that easy for the average user on  <br>00:30:02.640 various different hardware and is  <br>00:30:04.960 compatible right with different  <br>00:30:07.600 hardware and I  <br>00:30:09.720 mean I I don't know I think he hit the  <br>00:30:12.840 na on the head and you know I feel like  <br>00:30:15.240 it's so Val valuable for me to hear  <br>00:30:16.919 about these things because you know I've  <br>00:30:19.279 been using Linux for 22 years right so I  <br>00:30:22.000 want to hear what people are going  <br>00:30:23.840 through today I know what people were  <br>00:30:26.679 going through when I first learned about  <br>00:30:28.559 it I know what people are going through  <br>00:30:30.320 as I read the news and study the  <br>00:30:31.640 communities and look at what people are  <br>00:30:33.480 saying but that's never the same as  <br>00:30:35.399 hearing it straight from someone's mouth  <br>00:30:37.000 what was their personal experience it's  <br>00:30:40.159 their personal workflow they decided to  <br>00:30:42.799 give this a shot and then they have  <br>00:30:44.559 something to say about it and that  <br>00:30:45.799 feedback is valuable yeah I mean a lot  <br>00:30:47.679 of people don't want to because a lot of  <br>00:30:49.320 the  <br>00:30:50.080 times if you Tred links and you failed  <br>00:30:53.159 you don't want to admit cuz you know you  <br>00:30:54.840 seem dumb like it's it's almost like oh  <br>00:30:57.000 I failed this thing I must have done  <br>00:30:58.200 something wrong I don't want to go share  <br>00:31:00.039 that with a bunch of people and some  <br>00:31:01.159 people do obviously there's people out  <br>00:31:02.600 there that are saying oh you know I had  <br>00:31:04.440 this issue you know why did I fail but a  <br>00:31:06.559 lot of people don't like they just like  <br>00:31:08.799 you said put in a live CD mess around  <br>00:31:11.799 with it it didn't work for me or  <br>00:31:13.440 something broke unplug it never try  <br>00:31:15.399 again never tell anybody like it just  <br>00:31:16.880 sucks if someone asks you oh did you  <br>00:31:19.000 ever try Linux yeah I tried it once it  <br>00:31:20.200 was terrible like that's but we also  <br>00:31:22.799 have to keep in mind too that sometimes  <br>00:31:25.240 the whole thing changes and is reversed  <br>00:31:27.559 when  <br>00:31:28.639 someone starts with a different  <br>00:31:30.399 operating system like like I knew  <br>00:31:32.200 somebody know somebody that started with  <br>00:31:35.200 Linux like you know when she's young she  <br>00:31:37.320 wants a computer whatever I have spare  <br>00:31:39.320 parts put it together put Linux on it um  <br>00:31:42.279 gave it to her seemed to like it a lot  <br>00:31:44.519 there was no problems because that's  <br>00:31:45.840 what she started with she never really  <br>00:31:47.200 had any issues she was not a computer  <br>00:31:48.919 person either like like she just learned  <br>00:31:50.720 how to do it and and that was that but  <br>00:31:53.159 she got frustrated one day when her  <br>00:31:55.480 friend asked her to help her uh put MP3  <br>00:31:58.240 is and an MP3 player it wasn't an iPod  <br>00:32:00.000 it wasn't Zoom it wasn't anything crazy  <br>00:32:01.679 it's just one of those that's a flash  <br>00:32:03.120 drive and it works on every operating  <br>00:32:05.080 system so it did work on Linux and  <br>00:32:07.320 windows so her friend has Windows and  <br>00:32:09.679 and I'm trying to walk her through it  <br>00:32:10.679 I'm like okay here's what you do you  <br>00:32:11.720 click on the start button you go to my  <br>00:32:13.559 computer and when you're inside there  <br>00:32:15.200 you should see like some kind of icon  <br>00:32:16.760 that represents your um your music  <br>00:32:18.840 player and and that's exactly what it  <br>00:32:20.799 was but she gets irate and she's like  <br>00:32:23.360 why did I have to click three times to  <br>00:32:27.159 go to my MP3 player this design is  <br>00:32:29.600 stupid and then she starts like making  <br>00:32:32.320 fun of my computer like who thought  <br>00:32:34.120 that's like I don't know but that's just  <br>00:32:36.039 the way it is and that's just and I  <br>00:32:37.880 don't really have an opinion here but  <br>00:32:39.919 what the reason I remembered this so  <br>00:32:41.399 well is because what I saw was somebody  <br>00:32:44.480 who didn't start with Windows or Mac and  <br>00:32:46.519 I got a chance to see what their what  <br>00:32:48.840 their world is like it when that's the  <br>00:32:50.760 only thing they have experienced with  <br>00:32:53.000 and and you get to see what their issues  <br>00:32:54.880 are with Windows um and I'm not going to  <br>00:32:58.440 say that's a very standard thing but I  <br>00:33:01.039 do feel too that the operating system  <br>00:33:04.080 you start with colors your mindset of  <br>00:33:06.720 computing to a point where it's really  <br>00:33:08.120 hard to change that later yeah that's  <br>00:33:09.720 hard cuz how often do you get the  <br>00:33:11.039 opportunity to talk to somebody whose  <br>00:33:12.880 first operating system was Linux not  <br>00:33:15.279 very often wasn't so yeah not like many  <br>00:33:18.919 people's was but I will say I guess if I  <br>00:33:21.559 had to offer two pieces two the two most  <br>00:33:25.760 important things I think are barriers  <br>00:33:28.519 for a lot of people getting into Linux  <br>00:33:30.519 and this is both from personal  <br>00:33:31.600 experience and from talking to people in  <br>00:33:33.000 my community is one is Hardware  <br>00:33:37.200 compatibility and I don't know how you  <br>00:33:39.760 solve that if there's some uh  <br>00:33:42.519 centralized database that has all these  <br>00:33:45.120 different combinations or if there's  <br>00:33:46.760 some type of Hardware compatibility  <br>00:33:49.200 check that you can there are yeah there  <br>00:33:50.880 there are already it's just that you  <br>00:33:52.360 know there's at least a few of these but  <br>00:33:53.960 they last I checked they they they  <br>00:33:55.519 didn't have the information I was  <br>00:33:56.639 looking for I feel like you know we need  <br>00:33:59.399 something new that that that's you know  <br>00:34:01.960 with some excitement around it some  <br>00:34:03.679 people that really want to help this out  <br>00:34:05.440 they are willing to have someone you  <br>00:34:07.519 know send in hardware for them to play  <br>00:34:09.599 with and then report back you get enough  <br>00:34:11.839 volunteers all over the world that are  <br>00:34:14.040 willing to do this and not just say it  <br>00:34:17.000 works and that's it no we don't want  <br>00:34:19.040 that we want like some details if it's a  <br>00:34:21.239 GPU did you try multiple screens what  <br>00:34:23.760 refresh rate did you get what what  <br>00:34:25.760 monitor you know what what resolution  <br>00:34:27.839 did you get and was that the native  <br>00:34:29.480 resolution of your display I mean  <br>00:34:31.359 there's other kind of things that we  <br>00:34:32.760 really do need to know and we need a we  <br>00:34:35.679 need something that's going to provide  <br>00:34:38.560 that to users that's third party has no  <br>00:34:40.960 distribution interest and it's just  <br>00:34:43.879 there for that um and that's just one  <br>00:34:45.800 way but I feel like we will solve this I  <br>00:34:49.520 I also feel like part of the reason why  <br>00:34:50.918 it's so challenging right now is Linux  <br>00:34:52.719 is in a state of transition in many  <br>00:34:55.079 different ways simultaneously the system  <br>00:34:58.720 the display manager Universal apps are  <br>00:35:01.960 being introduced along with  <br>00:35:03.640 containerization and immutable  <br>00:35:05.400 distributions this is all being  <br>00:35:07.400 introduced right now okay it's going to  <br>00:35:10.920 be a little there's going to be some  <br>00:35:12.520 some dirt in the room and some dust you  <br>00:35:14.280 know I think for a little while yeah and  <br>00:35:16.160 the the second thing I think is um just  <br>00:35:18.760 package management like it's when I go  <br>00:35:21.680 into a drro I shouldn't have to worry  <br>00:35:24.560 about if it's using snap or flat pack or  <br>00:35:27.880 if I need to go find the Deb on their  <br>00:35:30.400 website or if I have to load in the  <br>00:35:32.320 specific repository and use app to get  <br>00:35:34.640 it like there's so many different I  <br>00:35:36.680 don't know if you standardize it or if  <br>00:35:38.359 you make a proper UI for a package  <br>00:35:41.839 manager that isn't terrible like it's  <br>00:35:44.880 just so frustrating because in Windows  <br>00:35:46.599 it's pretty standard and Mac is pretty  <br>00:35:48.480 standard you download the app you run it  <br>00:35:50.800 it's installed here it's like even in  <br>00:35:53.599 you even when you do have stores and you  <br>00:35:57.640 search for something and even in in  <br>00:35:59.720 repos it's like wait which version why  <br>00:36:01.880 do I have I want to install Plex Media  <br>00:36:04.440 Server to run on my Debian um desktop  <br>00:36:08.200 just to try it out whatever I I I type  <br>00:36:11.000 in Plex there's like four different  <br>00:36:12.400 versions I'm like that's a that's a  <br>00:36:14.640 legit problem absolutely and I'm so glad  <br>00:36:17.040 you mentioned that that's that's  <br>00:36:18.200 absolutely true that's I think those are  <br>00:36:19.760 the two big ones that if you can solve  <br>00:36:22.160 those that is the two biggest hurdles I  <br>00:36:26.280 think a lot of new people to Linux face  <br>00:36:29.079 including myself because those are the  <br>00:36:31.920 main things you interact with your  <br>00:36:33.160 hardware and your software and if either  <br>00:36:36.079 one of those you have issues with it  <br>00:36:39.200 you're going to give up and that's what  <br>00:36:40.640 happened to me so have you by chance  <br>00:36:43.000 tried app Images along the way or has  <br>00:36:44.839 that crossed your radar I I I have I  <br>00:36:48.280 think that when I was running  <br>00:36:50.119 aontu is it used in it's used it's  <br>00:36:53.200 another so it's another there's three  <br>00:36:54.880 primary Universal package formats that  <br>00:36:57.000 are buying pred dominance we have flat  <br>00:36:58.880 pack snap and app Images app Images  <br>00:37:01.880 being a distant third but what I the  <br>00:37:03.319 reason I bring them up is because you  <br>00:37:05.560 know my opinion is mixed about them but  <br>00:37:07.040 what I do like about them is it's like  <br>00:37:09.760 the app or excuse me the Mac App  <br>00:37:12.760 mentality on Linux you download like on  <br>00:37:15.000 Linux you or Mac you download a app  <br>00:37:17.400 right you double click on it you can run  <br>00:37:18.920 it you can put it in any folder you want  <br>00:37:20.319 it doesn't matter double click on it you  <br>00:37:21.440 run it so an app image you it's aapp  <br>00:37:24.000 image file you double click on it it  <br>00:37:25.680 runs it has everything it needs you put  <br>00:37:27.319 it in any folder you want and you just  <br>00:37:29.119 run it from that folder and then you  <br>00:37:30.440 could do you know for example you could  <br>00:37:32.359 have your syncing solution like sync  <br>00:37:34.680 things sync your you know apps folder  <br>00:37:36.920 with all your flat pack or app Images  <br>00:37:39.000 update one and then your you know Google  <br>00:37:41.359 drive or whatever it is will get all the  <br>00:37:42.920 others updated but I like that solution  <br>00:37:46.319 because you know it does give you the  <br>00:37:48.319 ability to just download something and  <br>00:37:50.040 run it you don't worry about it um the  <br>00:37:52.800 problem is not everything's available  <br>00:37:54.319 that way and then there's no like then  <br>00:37:57.119 you got to go in and update them all mhm  <br>00:37:59.160 and then you run into the Mac situation  <br>00:38:00.880 that Mac users run into where you have  <br>00:38:02.599 to download something like mac updater  <br>00:38:04.400 because you have um on Mac you have the  <br>00:38:06.440 App Store there's updates in there  <br>00:38:08.319 system settings you have your your Mac  <br>00:38:10.000 OS updates in there individual apps will  <br>00:38:12.680 update themselves or maybe they won't  <br>00:38:14.560 but you're supposed to go in and find  <br>00:38:15.720 out if they didn't or not some so in in  <br>00:38:19.000 Mac you have a lot of issues but they're  <br>00:38:21.040 not nearly as bad as the Linux issues  <br>00:38:23.440 but even with Mac it's really cool that  <br>00:38:25.599 you have aapp file you run it you're  <br>00:38:27.720 fine and with app Images which I'll have  <br>00:38:30.079 a video out shortly we'll explain how to  <br>00:38:32.400 use them but I bring that up because  <br>00:38:34.960 people are trying to come up with  <br>00:38:36.359 Solutions but you know we're going to  <br>00:38:38.319 have to decide in the community you know  <br>00:38:40.160 which way are we going yeah and that's  <br>00:38:41.599 the hard part and I think like everyone  <br>00:38:44.400 loves like repos like it's so great in  <br>00:38:47.760 Linux like oh you want a software app  <br>00:38:49.680 install this boom you're done it's funny  <br>00:38:52.800 I hate repos it's an nonp popular  <br>00:38:54.560 opinion because when I first started  <br>00:38:56.480 Linux I I'll never forget this it was  <br>00:38:58.640 like the very first version of auntu  <br>00:39:01.839 ever and I was using um open Office on  <br>00:39:04.680 that and then you know I'm liking it so  <br>00:39:07.119 I go online and I I find the news that a  <br>00:39:09.359 new version of open office has just come  <br>00:39:11.000 out and I'm like well that's really cool  <br>00:39:12.520 because I want to check that out I  <br>00:39:13.760 really like that so I ask in the  <br>00:39:16.160 communities how do I get that how can I  <br>00:39:18.040 install that like it's available now  <br>00:39:19.680 like just wait for the next version of a  <br>00:39:21.240 BTU I'm like wait a minute you're  <br>00:39:23.560 telling me I have to wait for the next  <br>00:39:25.760 version M of my entire operating system  <br>00:39:29.359 to have the courtesy of upgrading open  <br>00:39:31.960 Office when Mac and windows users are  <br>00:39:35.480 able to go to the website and download  <br>00:39:37.240 it and and you know Libre office  <br>00:39:39.480 nowadays I mean and even back then they  <br>00:39:41.200 might have had another repository but  <br>00:39:42.599 that's not even the point the point is  <br>00:39:44.760 you're being provided a package in the  <br>00:39:46.520 repositories that may or may not have a  <br>00:39:48.800 third party P repository that's so up to  <br>00:39:50.760 date but the issue you run into like  <br>00:39:53.599 like Linux users I don't think we can  <br>00:39:55.720 tell Mac or Windows users they have to  <br>00:39:57.880 wait for the next version of their  <br>00:39:59.079 operating system for the next version of  <br>00:40:00.720 their software the straight phas and  <br>00:40:03.280 that's why I've always hated that my  <br>00:40:04.720 mentality has been your Linux kernel  <br>00:40:07.800 display drivers critical operating  <br>00:40:11.200 system components can be apt packages  <br>00:40:13.599 they could be RPMs and distribution  <br>00:40:15.400 repos all day long but once you get to  <br>00:40:17.160 the user layer we need user space apps  <br>00:40:20.119 out of the package management completely  <br>00:40:23.200 we should not have Apache in the same  <br>00:40:26.760 reposit atory as our Linux kernel we  <br>00:40:29.000 should be able to install Apache  <br>00:40:32.000 separately via Universal package that is  <br>00:40:35.079 independent of the package system and  <br>00:40:37.640 this is why we run into problems where  <br>00:40:39.160 someone pip installs something and then  <br>00:40:40.839 it blows away their package database and  <br>00:40:43.280 and then they want to continue to say  <br>00:40:44.760 that repositories are great I'm sorry I  <br>00:40:46.960 know a lot of people in my audience are  <br>00:40:48.520 going to disagree with me on this  <br>00:40:50.480 software repositories are not good in  <br>00:40:52.720 the way that they're being run today in  <br>00:40:54.440 my opinion yeah and that's inside that  <br>00:40:56.680 you know as a novice I have no I like  <br>00:40:59.280 that that's not something that crosses  <br>00:41:01.200 my mind I'm the end user that when I am  <br>00:41:04.480 so used to app install of this and then  <br>00:41:07.920 it's it is confusing cuz you know as the  <br>00:41:11.280 new person comes in you're like wait  <br>00:41:12.839 everyone's telling me to use app install  <br>00:41:14.520 to get this but there's a a package  <br>00:41:17.200 there's a store shouldn't I use that to  <br>00:41:19.520 install it right it's like no like but  <br>00:41:22.119 wait yes but what do I do it's it's very  <br>00:41:24.520 confusing so usually what I tell people  <br>00:41:26.240 going forward for now at least to try to  <br>00:41:27.839 make sense of this craziness is when you  <br>00:41:29.880 go into your app store or whatever you  <br>00:41:32.640 want to call it and you want to download  <br>00:41:34.920 something sometimes or at least a lot of  <br>00:41:36.960 times there's a drop- down it'll say Deb  <br>00:41:38.920 version flat pack version RPM version  <br>00:41:41.319 flat pack version whatever the case may  <br>00:41:42.800 be what I'll tell people now until we  <br>00:41:45.000 figure this out is just download the  <br>00:41:48.400 distribution package for now unless you  <br>00:41:52.280 need the newer version now one trick one  <br>00:41:55.160 tip I give everyone about Linux is you  <br>00:41:57.319 should never ever ever ever consider  <br>00:41:59.920 using the distribution version of Libre  <br>00:42:02.560 office that should be the first thing  <br>00:42:04.520 you install you should never open it you  <br>00:42:06.359 should never consider opening it you  <br>00:42:07.880 need to delete it and then after you do  <br>00:42:09.680 that you could get Libre office as a  <br>00:42:11.800 flat pack that is fully up to date now  <br>00:42:13.839 why am I asking you to remove this now  <br>00:42:15.760 here's the problem Libre office gets  <br>00:42:17.560 stigma people will say it's not as good  <br>00:42:19.720 as Microsoft Office and the reason why  <br>00:42:21.559 they say this I think at least in part  <br>00:42:24.359 is they have a very old version in their  <br>00:42:27.599 distributions repository that they have  <br>00:42:30.119 installed and since then lib office has  <br>00:42:32.520 been you know as they do they look for  <br>00:42:35.520 ways to reverse engineer what Microsoft  <br>00:42:37.440 is doing they fix things as they're  <br>00:42:39.079 broken they keep updating it and you  <br>00:42:41.559 need to be using a newer version of libr  <br>00:42:43.720 office to benefit from the continual  <br>00:42:45.680 fixes that they put into this but now  <br>00:42:48.240 because distributions are shipping this  <br>00:42:51.400 and they're shipping old versions I mean  <br>00:42:52.880 what version do we have in in Debian  <br>00:42:54.400 stable right now probably two major  <br>00:42:56.200 versions old I'm just guessing but my  <br>00:42:57.880 point is they open this up they get a  <br>00:43:00.880 Microsoft Word file from a coworker for  <br>00:43:03.680 example they get formatting issues and  <br>00:43:05.960 it doesn't look right and tables are  <br>00:43:07.880 broken and everything looks a mess I get  <br>00:43:10.480 the same file in the lib office version  <br>00:43:12.400 that's newer and it's fine but you know  <br>00:43:15.119 sometimes I think distributions have to  <br>00:43:16.640 realize that they themselves are you  <br>00:43:19.200 know making things harder for people  <br>00:43:21.079 yeah it's totally true so I don't know  <br>00:43:23.960 if we solved any issues today but hope  <br>00:43:25.680 we did hope we that's what I saying like  <br>00:43:27.960 throughout this whole week is like  <br>00:43:29.720 you're not going to solve all these  <br>00:43:31.079 issues in a day but it definitely takes  <br>00:43:33.240 you got to start somewhere and you got  <br>00:43:34.400 to have the conversations CU if you  <br>00:43:36.240 don't it's just going to keep going how  <br>00:43:38.480 it is and we've seen how it's going and  <br>00:43:40.480 obviously with linux's 6% desktop share  <br>00:43:44.319 if we want that to increase you're going  <br>00:43:46.240 to have to have conversations people are  <br>00:43:47.680 going to have to make tough decisions  <br>00:43:49.160 that some people don't like but you get  <br>00:43:51.800 some somebody's got to start making some  <br>00:43:53.359 decisions well we are the again we are  <br>00:43:55.839 the marketing for Linux we are the  <br>00:43:58.240 marketing the Linux Community Linux  <br>00:44:00.319 users we're we and especially YouTubers  <br>00:44:03.160 like ourselves we are the marketing you  <br>00:44:05.559 will not at least not now see a Linux  <br>00:44:07.960 related commercial on TV I haven't seen  <br>00:44:10.119 one personally maybe in some other  <br>00:44:11.359 countries where you know sus is more  <br>00:44:12.960 popular for example maybe that happens I  <br>00:44:14.520 don't know but we are the marketing  <br>00:44:16.920 which is why I put so much work into  <br>00:44:18.200 special effects in this channel because  <br>00:44:20.040 I want to position Linux in the best  <br>00:44:21.800 light possible because we all need to do  <br>00:44:24.599 that because if if we just need to do  <br>00:44:27.359 the best we can and and sometimes that  <br>00:44:29.000 could mean someone sees a problem and  <br>00:44:31.119 they want to step up and come up with a  <br>00:44:33.559 solution I encourage anybody in the  <br>00:44:36.280 audience share some ideas if you think  <br>00:44:37.960 you know a solution to this or even if  <br>00:44:40.359 it's in the form of new software you  <br>00:44:41.880 want to develop or or something that you  <br>00:44:44.119 want to not develop because you're not a  <br>00:44:45.839 developer but draw out on paper for all  <br>00:44:48.240 I care um if you have an idea I think we  <br>00:44:51.079 need to get those ideas to the people  <br>00:44:53.160 that can make that happen if that person  <br>00:44:55.079 isn't you and you know you know to  <br>00:44:58.319 actually put feet on the ground on these  <br>00:45:00.960 problems and get this solved and I I  <br>00:45:02.760 hope people in my community anybody  <br>00:45:05.480 that's complaining about something a  <br>00:45:07.160 valid complaint that's not something's  <br>00:45:08.800 not working do you have the time to do  <br>00:45:11.000 something about it do you have the  <br>00:45:12.599 expertise to do something about it if  <br>00:45:14.160 you don't do you know somebody that does  <br>00:45:15.920 do you know somewhere where this  <br>00:45:17.680 conversation can get started and that's  <br>00:45:20.000 what we need to do and I feel like we  <br>00:45:22.440 can we can get there but the Linux  <br>00:45:24.520 Community will be who decides that yeah  <br>00:45:27.079 100% and maybe we're back next year and  <br>00:45:30.000 things are different I hope so it'd be  <br>00:45:31.880 fun it' be fun to do a sequel to this is  <br>00:45:34.680 it better yet yeah that would be  <br>00:45:36.599 entertaining but yeah this was awesome  <br>00:45:38.800 it's good to sit down you know a lot of  <br>00:45:40.920 people their first impression of of  <br>00:45:42.720 Linux is bad and they get discouraged  <br>00:45:44.520 because they go to the forums and get  <br>00:45:46.280 that feedback but it's good to you know  <br>00:45:47.920 sit down and have a conversation about  <br>00:45:49.720 what your issues are without you know  <br>00:45:51.920 and and and talk about actual Solutions  <br>00:45:53.720 instead of just a bunch of angry  <br>00:45:56.520 comments and people screaming things  <br>00:45:59.960 that just don't help anybody so yeah  <br>00:46:02.800 like Jay said in the comments like if  <br>00:46:04.559 you know anybody if you have the  <br>00:46:05.680 expertise to make things better I'm all  <br>00:46:07.599 here for it I know I I had a Linux video  <br>00:46:10.800 where I failed but I legitimately am  <br>00:46:14.079 still using Linux I have the the laptop  <br>00:46:16.680 I brought it with me here it's what I've  <br>00:46:18.040 been using I'm still using Linux he's  <br>00:46:19.920 still trying it like like he's try he's  <br>00:46:21.640 he's he has he's doing a presentation  <br>00:46:23.520 about it meanwhile he's actively still  <br>00:46:26.599 right now I saw him just trying some  <br>00:46:28.200 stuff on Linux Mint with with your GPU  <br>00:46:30.480 issue so we'll be back next year to see  <br>00:46:33.760 where we're at but yes was this was  <br>00:46:35.720 awesome

Mariusz Pudzianowski)  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/SIhwxl5lK-M](https://www.youtube.com/watch/SIhwxl5lK-M)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.040 Eddie Hall Brian Shaw Thor they are all  <br>00:00:02.800 world's strongest men winners but they  <br>00:00:04.279 all take second place to the true  <br>00:00:06.000 all-time greatest World's Strongest Man  <br>00:00:08.320 Marius panowski  <br>00:00:13.000 his career was not without  <br>00:00:15.720 controversy Mario from po 25 years old 1  <br>00:00:20.320 M 186 130 kg So today we're going to be  <br>00:00:25.199 going through not only one of his  <br>00:00:26.960 classic gym routines but also his  <br>00:00:29.000 strongman routine as well well we're  <br>00:00:30.400 going to learn a lot of information  <br>00:00:31.800 about Marius and we're going to see if  <br>00:00:33.200 we can survive this psychotic dominating  <br>00:00:36.440 man's workout  <br>00:00:38.120 routine oh man I don't know only  <br>00:00:41.600 training very good Training flip and r  <br>00:00:45.000 no problem Marius did a lot of warming  <br>00:00:47.559 up whether it was jump rope whether it  <br>00:00:49.480 was Mobility like lateral squats he also  <br>00:00:52.199 did a lot of warming up in preparation  <br>00:00:55.359 for exercises such as the squats he did  <br>00:00:57.840 up to eight warm-up sets before we  <br>00:01:00.120 moving on to his working set so as  <br>00:01:02.039 Brandon is warming up I would like to  <br>00:01:04.159 introduce someone that's going to help  <br>00:01:06.320 us out through this workout someone  <br>00:01:07.960 native to the country of Poland my wife  <br>00:01:10.799 agneska and she's going to be a little  <br>00:01:13.479 bit of our judge referee and she's also  <br>00:01:16.520 going to reward us with this um very  <br>00:01:20.240 comfortable polish Banner as you can see  <br>00:01:22.560 here when she really feels that were  <br>00:01:24.720 worthy of the  <br>00:01:28.920 colors  <br>00:01:30.280 [Music]  <br>00:01:40.180 [Music]  <br>00:01:57.439 for Polish sty  <br>00:02:04.920 yeah I feel proud of  <br>00:02:07.160 myself po  <br>00:02:10.000 sc one bit of controversy during  <br>00:02:12.400 marius's Reign is the fact that there  <br>00:02:14.319 was a couple different organizations the  <br>00:02:17.040 ifsa and also the WSC so you had  <br>00:02:20.160 athletes in both of those which kind of  <br>00:02:22.120 split the competition a bit and some  <br>00:02:23.680 people feel maybe that diluted the  <br>00:02:25.640 competitive field there was also of  <br>00:02:27.680 course the Arnold Classic where when  <br>00:02:29.959 Marius did compete in he never plays any  <br>00:02:32.400 greater than fourth maybe you could have  <br>00:02:34.200 done  <br>00:02:36.000 more so that's where some critics may  <br>00:02:38.640 say he didn't face the best of the best  <br>00:02:40.879 but regardless his time in the ifsa he  <br>00:02:43.800 did win the five titles and the ifsa to  <br>00:02:46.840 this day is still the premier  <br>00:02:48.879 organization yes I'm very happy squats  <br>00:02:52.680 are out of the way we're moving on to  <br>00:02:53.720 pull-ups this one we feel a little bit  <br>00:02:55.239 more confident with this is kind of  <br>00:02:57.080 constantly a staple although squats were  <br>00:02:58.920 too it's just is we're not used to the  <br>00:03:00.760 weight of that capacity so we've got six  <br>00:03:03.360 sets 15 reps a lot of Endurance on this  <br>00:03:06.640 one some critics argue that many events  <br>00:03:08.720 in marius's years lean more towards  <br>00:03:10.720 endurance and stamina playing to his  <br>00:03:12.920 strengths including events like Farmers  <br>00:03:14.959 walks Atlas stones and some truck pulls  <br>00:03:17.360 drags that required more of that  <br>00:03:19.280 cardiovascular fitness than pure  <br>00:03:20.959 strength and he really excelled in these  <br>00:03:23.519 type of events there was also less  <br>00:03:25.599 emphasis on static strength events like  <br>00:03:27.760 the max deadlift squat or overhead press  <br>00:03:29.959 which test absolute strength were  <br>00:03:32.560 arguably less common or emphasized  <br>00:03:35.040 during this period and finally pu  <br>00:03:37.080 janowski's athletic background he had  <br>00:03:40.080 experience in sports like boxing and  <br>00:03:41.840 rugby which really contributed to his  <br>00:03:44.239 Superior endurance compared to some  <br>00:03:46.159 competitors who Focus solely on strength  <br>00:03:49.599 training  <br>00:03:51.560 oh I think I'm going to spend my next  <br>00:03:53.760 set doing this this feels way better  <br>00:03:55.799 than the pull-ups we're on to set five  <br>00:03:58.040 I'm going to need a little bit of that  <br>00:03:59.079 polish spirit we're going into  <br>00:04:01.599 overtime keep me going give me that oh  <br>00:04:06.560 SC give me that here we go here we go  <br>00:04:09.640 okay that's now we have the Polish um  <br>00:04:13.000 the Polish cloak on of invincibility  <br>00:04:16.079 this is like Harry Potter right  <br>00:04:17.320 here strong man style okay the Polish  <br>00:04:19.560 cloak of strength nobility and fortitude  <br>00:04:49.639 wow that was the Polish Groot squeeze of  <br>00:04:54.120 activation and Truth  <br>00:04:59.960 M Jin yes you'll notice in this that is  <br>00:05:02.800 a combination of legs and  <br>00:05:04.759 shoulders that's why you can do so much  <br>00:05:07.960 more weight it's not just a push press  <br>00:05:11.960 it's kind of like a push like in your in  <br>00:05:14.880 your dipping under the bars you push as  <br>00:05:17.039 it's F floating up and you catch it and  <br>00:05:19.880 then squat the rest of the way there a  <br>00:05:22.000 lot of legs in this and you'll see maros  <br>00:05:24.440 he does a ton of weight on that  <br>00:05:27.759 particularly because it's not just all  <br>00:05:29.120 on the shoulders although he obviously  <br>00:05:30.560 had very strong shoulders but it's it's  <br>00:05:32.919 a lot of driving the legs and the hips  <br>00:05:35.479 that's really important in this and they  <br>00:05:36.720 do a lot of that in strong man that's  <br>00:05:37.880 why he's turning that way in there too  <br>00:05:39.759 oh oh  <br>00:05:43.000 btoa duja Maz  <br>00:05:46.000 chesna bless you exactly yeah I have  <br>00:05:51.280 been blessed Super  <br>00:05:53.639 mazna S Superman I can die now but don't  <br>00:05:58.039 die during this workout I might that's  <br>00:06:00.000 why I could say I can die now we will  <br>00:06:02.000 bury you in this growing up to me there  <br>00:06:04.400 was nothing more exciting than sitting  <br>00:06:06.880 down on a Sunday morning booting up ESPN  <br>00:06:09.039 2 seeing there's a world's strongest man  <br>00:06:11.199 cuz they kind of came on sporadically  <br>00:06:12.599 back then and seeing Marius just Crush  <br>00:06:14.800 those events man cuz when you knew he  <br>00:06:17.000 got to the endurance ones whether he was  <br>00:06:18.639 like pulling something really heavy or  <br>00:06:20.720 running holding something like an anvil  <br>00:06:23.240 that guy just crushed it I mean no one  <br>00:06:26.039 else stood a chance you know he' pick up  <br>00:06:28.520 the heavyweight bring them up the stairs  <br>00:06:30.599 and you'd see the other guys you could  <br>00:06:31.680 actually see it in their eyes look at  <br>00:06:33.400 him and go how does this guy do it and  <br>00:06:36.080 what's really crazy is in one of Brian  <br>00:06:37.960 Shaw's first competitions he actually  <br>00:06:39.599 went up against Marius and it was a  <br>00:06:41.599 really tight race but in the end Marius  <br>00:06:44.120 just pulled ahead enough to win so it's  <br>00:06:46.560 a little exciting bit of almost like  <br>00:06:48.199 passing the torch in a way onto the next  <br>00:06:50.120 generation of strongman and that is why  <br>00:06:52.319 it was so cool to see those guys compete  <br>00:06:53.919 just once which Brian Shaw is on record  <br>00:06:56.080 saying he was just really so blown away  <br>00:06:58.080 by marius's work ethic he would practice  <br>00:07:00.800 the full World's Strongest Man days  <br>00:07:03.680 before the event itself to prepare  <br>00:07:05.520 himself and if there was a certain  <br>00:07:06.759 exercise he didn't quite understand such  <br>00:07:08.560 as like the circus dumbbell he would  <br>00:07:10.360 just learn it over and over and Brian  <br>00:07:12.360 Shaw would be watching him do that in  <br>00:07:14.800 awe going wow so this is how you become  <br>00:07:16.639 a champion and later Brian Shaw become a  <br>00:07:18.759 champion  <br>00:07:22.720 himself you got it  <br>00:07:25.919 nice yeah it's really cool seeing  <br>00:07:27.720 marius's tram because he not only did  <br>00:07:29.520 did all those big compound movements  <br>00:07:31.240 that he used to train for the strong man  <br>00:07:33.319 competitions but he also implemented a  <br>00:07:35.680 lot of isolation work a lot of  <br>00:07:37.280 bodybuilding style movements like flies  <br>00:07:40.199 tricep extensions bicep curls crucifix  <br>00:07:42.759 curls it's really cool seeing that and  <br>00:07:44.159 obviously it paid off cuz he had an  <br>00:07:45.680 amazing physique and a physique that  <br>00:07:47.400 rivaled some of the top bodybuilders  <br>00:07:49.599 even today so naturally we're going to  <br>00:07:53.120 end it off with doing some flies oh yeah  <br>00:07:56.479 cuz a lot of times it's all about the p  <br>00:08:01.580 [Music]  <br>00:08:11.159 man come at me bro which is you know  <br>00:08:13.840 this Segways perfectly into the fact  <br>00:08:16.879 that when Marius retired from strongman  <br>00:08:18.720 he actually entered mixed martial arts  <br>00:08:22.360 competition and that's true that's  <br>00:08:24.840 actually true so um I can actually see  <br>00:08:27.120 this was maybe the Genesis of Mario just  <br>00:08:29.080 getting so at the weights all the time  <br>00:08:30.240 he's like and he's like Bingo fighting  <br>00:08:32.958 career um we actually need our polish  <br>00:08:36.279 judge referee historian because she's  <br>00:08:39.159 going to tell us when Marius entered his  <br>00:08:41.399 first mixed martial arts  <br>00:08:43.039 competition it was a really big event in  <br>00:08:45.839 Poland Poland is a nation of 40 million  <br>00:08:47.800 people a lot of people of course know  <br>00:08:49.440 who Marius is tell us a little bit about  <br>00:08:51.680 marius's first mixed martial arts about  <br>00:08:54.680 um yeah I remember the whole family was  <br>00:08:56.600 watching and uh I was a kid so you know  <br>00:08:59.160 I don't I didn't know much about the  <br>00:09:00.880 sport at the time but um I do remember  <br>00:09:03.880 it being very quick and very surprising  <br>00:09:07.360 I think what I remember was just him  <br>00:09:09.519 getting onto the ring and just ramming  <br>00:09:11.880 into the other guy and that was it so  <br>00:09:15.079 that was definitely shocking and you  <br>00:09:16.720 know interesting and we were cheering  <br>00:09:18.560 but I was a little confused as a child  <br>00:09:20.680 cuz I was like is that how it's supposed  <br>00:09:22.399 to look like that is not how it's  <br>00:09:23.880 supposed to look yeah it wasn't so much  <br>00:09:25.480 technique it was just Brute Force he was  <br>00:09:27.480 just a big muscly back ing Ram they  <br>00:09:30.160 could have used him in ancient Europe to  <br>00:09:31.640 storm castles they just would have run  <br>00:09:33.680 head first into it that's basically how  <br>00:09:36.360 it looked we're on to the evening  <br>00:09:38.320 portion of marius's lifts and now it's  <br>00:09:40.279 time for the strong man I'm still  <br>00:09:41.720 recovering from what we just did in the  <br>00:09:42.959 gym but now we got more to go I mean  <br>00:09:45.279 this is more the event style lifts this  <br>00:09:47.279 is that training specificity he went all  <br>00:09:50.040 out and we're not going to be hitting  <br>00:09:52.000 marius's records anytime soon but what  <br>00:09:53.839 we are going to be doing is circuit  <br>00:09:55.839 style training brother vers brother who  <br>00:09:58.200 can get the fastest time oh  <br>00:10:01.920 yeah I one 10  <br>00:10:05.680 oh so this is what we're going to be  <br>00:10:07.560 doing we're going to be starting with  <br>00:10:08.720 the clean press right here we're going  <br>00:10:10.760 to be doing five repetitions immediately  <br>00:10:12.640 going on to the farmer carry over here  <br>00:10:15.200 we're going to be doing two laps with it  <br>00:10:18.720 once we're done with that we're going to  <br>00:10:19.839 go over here to the kettle  <br>00:10:22.160 bell and do 10 repetitions of lift this  <br>00:10:25.959 heavy sucker up here taking it down

why well  <br>00:00:04.880 I've been stuck in the past failing to  <br>00:00:06.759 see how easily notion Ai and some other  <br>00:00:09.240 quick shortcut features can massively  <br>00:00:11.480 Save Us hours and optimize our workflow  <br>00:00:14.480 now like me you might have been dubious  <br>00:00:16.520 as to how usable AI actually was in  <br>00:00:18.920 notion after hours of experimenting  <br>00:00:21.279 these are the best ways to use it that  <br>00:00:23.519 actually work saving you time and  <br>00:00:25.720 improving the quality of your work in  <br>00:00:28.000

second brain both easier to use  <br>00:00:41.360 and more powerful I mean these days it  <br>00:00:43.559 can even talk to you stick around for  <br>00:00:45.640 that and thank you to short form my  <br>00:00:47.840 other secret productivity tool for  <br>00:00:50.079 sponsoring this video this first one is  <br>00:00:53.039 a very exciting Discovery for me the new  <br>00:00:55.640 AI database properties are great and can  <br>00:00:58.199 help you a huge amount but often feel a  <br>00:01:00.440 bit generic and meaningless when used as  <br>00:01:03.039 a simple summary unless you Embrace how  <br>00:01:05.640 to customize them let me show you then  <br>00:01:07.720 some amazing examples that have been big  <br>00:01:09.880 news for me with how I've been using  <br>00:01:12.400 notion AI to manage my YouTube video  <br>00:01:14.920 creation from scripting through to  <br>00:01:16.680 managing projects with collaborators so  <br>00:01:19.000 if we click to my content manager you'll  <br>00:01:21.360 see all of my current videos including  <br>00:01:23.280 the one we're working on and this is  <br>00:01:24.720 where I run my channel now at the moment  <br>00:01:26.720 I'm working on creating a help Bop for  <br>00:01:29.479 my life OS template users to assist them  <br>00:01:32.200 something that can direct people to the  <br>00:01:33.960 relevant notion videos in my library  <br>00:01:36.439 which is here that link to specific  <br>00:01:38.399 templates I mentioned for example right  <br>00:01:40.560 down here I have all of my published  <br>00:01:43.119 videos with the links notion AI has  <br>00:01:45.680 helped this massively in the content  <br>00:01:47.799 manager so if we click on my simplified  <br>00:01:50.159 notion life OS tour you'll see that I  <br>00:01:52.159 have here a AI content summary tool this  <br>00:01:56.360 was generated by AI it is summarizing  <br>00:01:59.280 the title of the video it's putting the  <br>00:02:00.880 URL an intro to what happens talking  <br>00:02:03.399 about what I cover and saying why people  <br>00:02:05.600 should watch if I click in here and we  <br>00:02:07.880 edit the property we have an AI autofill  <br>00:02:11.200 and within this I can list a custom  <br>00:02:13.720 autofill so please do the following  <br>00:02:16.000 write the video title and URL then  <br>00:02:18.000 summarize the content of the following  <br>00:02:19.720 sections and then finally a subheading  <br>00:02:21.840 of why to watch and share some  <br>00:02:23.440 information on why people might enjoy  <br>00:02:25.080 watching it so what that's actually  <br>00:02:26.480 doing is down here we have in scripting  <br>00:02:29.680 we have the hook and setup here that I  <br>00:02:32.120 wrote as a script and we have a list of  <br>00:02:34.480 everything that I cover in the video  <br>00:02:36.440 planned out when I did my tour of this  <br>00:02:38.959 simplified life OS that I made and it  <br>00:02:41.200 summarized all of those details I've  <br>00:02:43.480 also created a property which is a  <br>00:02:45.879 custom auto and I've listed in here what  <br>00:02:48.959 to generate you're an expert in SEO  <br>00:02:50.959 create a YouTube description for the  <br>00:02:53.640 video and it can actually generate  <br>00:02:55.720 things as well let's give it a go you'll  <br>00:02:57.360 see it is writing out the video title  <br>00:03:00.519 it's suggested some sections and it's  <br>00:03:02.680 given me some keywords that is a huge  <br>00:03:04.560 amount of work for me normally which I  <br>00:03:06.239 can now work from in that video and I'm  <br>00:03:09.040 ready to rock so if you wanted to do  <br>00:03:11.040 this you would simply create whatever  <br>00:03:13.280 database that you want you would select  <br>00:03:15.480 a new property and you have these  <br>00:03:17.280 options up here for AI keywords  <br>00:03:19.440 translation custom autofill and AI  <br>00:03:21.560 summary I think this one is really  <br>00:03:23.440 powerful so if in my content manager I  <br>00:03:25.519 wanted to add a new one let's say I  <br>00:03:27.120 wanted keywords for each I could select  <br>00:03:29.159 the AI keywords option can see more  <br>00:03:31.680 details about it what to  <br>00:03:33.599 generate let's try  <br>00:03:35.640 it and you can see in here we now have  <br>00:03:38.680 if I wrap the column a list of keywords  <br>00:03:41.879 so this could be great in a larger  <br>00:03:43.560 system maybe you'd want to use it in a  <br>00:03:45.120 journal and you could add in keywords  <br>00:03:47.519 into the system and do it all  <br>00:03:49.040 automatically but even more remarkable  <br>00:03:50.959 for a while I found that notion AI could  <br>00:03:53.280 actually go further than this so if I  <br>00:03:55.040 open up this iPad accessories video  <br>00:03:57.200 there's my content summary as we've set  <br>00:03:59.519 but below it I've got this a final video  <br>00:04:02.480 description and it seemed strangely that  <br>00:04:05.159 it would reach outside the system it has  <br>00:04:07.400 since weirdly stopped working so this is  <br>00:04:09.480 an unconfirmed bit of info and in fact  <br>00:04:11.920 occasionally notion AI has raised an  <br>00:04:13.560 error saying it couldn't look at  <br>00:04:15.200 external URLs but take a look at this  <br>00:04:17.358 example what I've done with this if we  <br>00:04:19.399 look at the property final video  <br>00:04:21.079 description it says using the URL  <br>00:04:23.479 property link please find the video  <br>00:04:25.280 description for that link on YouTube and  <br>00:04:27.600 share the text from that video descript  <br>00:04:29.680 description in this property and it's  <br>00:04:31.600 genuinely done that this is the  <br>00:04:33.720 description for my video listing  <br>00:04:36.440 everything into it including all of my  <br>00:04:38.360 links to the products if I now jump to  <br>00:04:40.759 the YouTube page there it all is there  <br>00:04:43.720 is all the information that we listed in  <br>00:04:46.639 it so leave me a comment below if you  <br>00:04:48.440 found any other unexpected use cases and  <br>00:04:51.240 do give this a go and let me know if it  <br>00:04:52.880 works for you I've also used the key  <br>00:04:54.960 info option to list key topics on my  <br>00:04:57.280 clippings and notes pages and love the  <br>00:04:59.800 summary feature for journaling templates  <br>00:05:02.479 to Summarize each entry in a gallery  <br>00:05:04.960 view so I've been using this in my  <br>00:05:07.039 notion Essentials template so I've got  <br>00:05:09.160 all these different templates you can  <br>00:05:10.720 put the template in fill it out and then  <br>00:05:13.160 you will see the summary of what you've  <br>00:05:14.560 written in here but for example maybe  <br>00:05:16.680 you wanted to create a AI categories  <br>00:05:18.639 thing we could add a property here new  <br>00:05:20.840 property and we'll do AI keywords multi  <br>00:05:25.680 select and let's call this AI category  <br>00:05:30.680 something like that save the changes try  <br>00:05:34.080 on this page and if we now show it in  <br>00:05:36.639 here there you go it's coming up and you  <br>00:05:38.800 can add really quickly AI keyword  <br>00:05:41.680 summaries into the system you can check  <br>00:05:43.840 out my notion Essentials templates via  <br>00:05:45.960 the link below if you want to try any of  <br>00:05:47.840 these out now use case number two for  <br>00:05:49.639 you life OS and second brain users is  <br>00:05:51.880 that these summary properties get even  <br>00:05:53.840 cooler if we use AI from notion  <br>00:05:57.759 alongside save to notion to summarize  <br>00:06:00.400 clipping so if we jump to a web page you  <br>00:06:04.000 can download the Chrome extension for  <br>00:06:05.600 save to notion and you can create these  <br>00:06:07.360 forms right which are rather good and  <br>00:06:09.400 it'll link things in and include stuff  <br>00:06:11.440 in so what I want to do is I'm going to  <br>00:06:13.000 add a new property to that database add  <br>00:06:15.800 a new property and we'll make that a  <br>00:06:18.680 simple AI  <br>00:06:20.840 summary how about this summarize in  <br>00:06:23.800 bullet points the key information and  <br>00:06:25.720 lessons from the page material and  <br>00:06:27.840 reference any other possible page pages  <br>00:06:29.840 in my workspace that could be relevant  <br>00:06:31.520 to it so I'm going to save that there  <br>00:06:34.120 and what we'll do is we'll jump to here  <br>00:06:37.639 back to our page and our save to notion  <br>00:06:40.199 option I'm going to add a new field in  <br>00:06:42.240 here and I'm going to find the AI  <br>00:06:44.759 summary option there it is and we want  <br>00:06:47.280 to put all of the  <br>00:06:48.800 content web page content is going to go  <br>00:06:51.120 in and I'm going to save it so it's web  <br>00:06:53.120 page content it's all ready to go and  <br>00:06:55.479 maybe I will give this a status of on  <br>00:06:58.160 reading list so I can up up date it all  <br>00:07:00.039 in there then you save it to your  <br>00:07:02.879 workspace and now if we jump back there  <br>00:07:05.000 it is so there's all the information if  <br>00:07:06.800 we then get that to do its thing it  <br>00:07:09.240 summarizes everything within that page  <br>00:07:11.759 this is a brilliant use of AI to clean  <br>00:07:14.680 up the way you look at your information  <br>00:07:17.120 so notion AI is $10 for the add-on but  <br>00:07:20.680 if you see the value that is an amazing  <br>00:07:22.879 deal okay so that's cool but we can go  <br>00:07:25.800 further and actually talk to your  <br>00:07:27.879 workspaces to explore all the knowledge  <br>00:07:30.479 within them more on that later in the  <br>00:07:32.560 video but first let's look at a few of  <br>00:07:35.120 the latest quick and simple tricks that  <br>00:07:37.240 I've found that can also speed up how  <br>00:07:40.080 you use notion not just AI so my  <br>00:07:43.240 favorite new feature has got to be this  <br>00:07:45.599 if I go into my sidebar and I want to  <br>00:07:48.319 open something in a new tab press  <br>00:07:50.080 command and then click it and it opens  <br>00:07:53.039 it in a new tab that is super brilliant  <br>00:07:56.479 and on that note if I want to reference  <br>00:07:58.280 a page ever or get the link for it  <br>00:08:00.319 command L will copy it to your clipboard  <br>00:08:03.440 so that means if I go back into here  <br>00:08:05.479 command V mention the page you can very  <br>00:08:07.879 quickly create yourself a little menu  <br>00:08:10.159 using at mentions or this is just a  <br>00:08:12.440 great way to share pages with people  <br>00:08:14.319 that you're working with and finally on  <br>00:08:15.919 this list is number three AI tables and  <br>00:08:18.639 databases this one up here was created  <br>00:08:21.759 by creating a simple table and then  <br>00:08:24.639 turning it into a database so to  <br>00:08:27.199 shortcut that first part of the building  <br>00:08:29.560 process when you want to get a new  <br>00:08:31.319 bespoke nation database created this is  <br>00:08:33.880 a fantastic trick the quickest way to  <br>00:08:35.760 get into AI is just to press space and I  <br>00:08:38.320 can write what I want so I might say  <br>00:08:40.360 create a table of the top classic  <br>00:08:45.360 motorcycles from the UK and  <br>00:08:49.200 Europe let's see what that does there it  <br>00:08:52.080 goes year release best features  <br>00:08:53.519 reference URL it's creating the table  <br>00:08:56.080 and filling it out of course you would  <br>00:08:58.000 want to probably do a little bit more  <br>00:09:00.079 work on this yourself but look how fast  <br>00:09:02.440 it's creating this let's say it's done  <br>00:09:05.000 I'm then going to click on the side  <br>00:09:06.240 panel here click turn into database and  <br>00:09:08.920 just copy these into the  <br>00:09:12.200 columns and this one we will edit the  <br>00:09:15.480 property and turn it into a URL and we  <br>00:09:18.680 will delete this so it's a bit flawed  <br>00:09:20.800 but you get the idea another great tip  <br>00:09:22.839 with AI here is create yourself a  <br>00:09:25.120 database template edit the template and  <br>00:09:28.320 create yourself in here a custom AI  <br>00:09:31.160 block and then that will generate what  <br>00:09:33.160 you need into the page let us know what  <br>00:09:35.560 your favorite notion shortcuts are in  <br>00:09:37.480 the comments so we can all learn from  <br>00:09:38.800 each other and while you're there give  <br>00:09:40.360 me a thumbs up so that's got you saving  <br>00:09:42.519 some time in notion but it doesn't mean  <br>00:09:44.920 much unless the work you get done is  <br>00:09:46.800 actually meaningful so next we'll look  <br>00:09:48.760 at some notion AI features that can  <br>00:09:50.800 improve the quality of your work before  <br>00:09:52.920 that though I want to show you another  <br>00:09:54.360 app I've used for years alongside notion  <br>00:09:56.680 to improve my learning and knowledge  <br>00:09:58.519 short form and it's got its own AI  <br>00:10:00.680 features that have supercharged it even  <br>00:10:02.720 further now if you don't know by now  <br>00:10:04.560 short form is my favorite solution for  <br>00:10:06.800 recapping and discovering the key ideas  <br>00:10:09.440 in non-fiction books in advance of  <br>00:10:11.760 reading them of course and they cover a  <br>00:10:13.880 range of subjects like productivity  <br>00:10:16.320 creativity and Entrepreneurship it's  <br>00:10:18.480 more than a summary tool though and  <br>00:10:19.959 that's what's particularly cool it  <br>00:10:21.839 offers additional insights interactive  <br>00:10:24.120 exercises offering further perspectives  <br>00:10:26.279 on what you read I've recently finished  <br>00:10:28.000 reading the procrastination Cure by  <br>00:10:30.440 Daman zaharis a super useful book on  <br>00:10:33.399 understanding why we procrastinate and  <br>00:10:35.160 waste time another way to make sure you  <br>00:10:36.800 can get more done with less alongside  <br>00:10:38.440 these tricks but short form has an AI  <br>00:10:40.760 Chrome browser extension of its own and  <br>00:10:43.279 it's particularly accurate compared to  <br>00:10:45.120 others that I've tried now I'm finding  <br>00:10:47.079 it genuinely useful as a research tool  <br>00:10:49.320 to improve the quality of the content  <br>00:10:51.399 that I create it has fundamental  <br>00:10:53.040 features many AI extensions like they  <br>00:10:55.160 should generating high quality summaries  <br>00:10:57.120 for anything on the internet from emails  <br>00:10:59.320 to videos listing the key ideas and  <br>00:11:01.680 simplifying long and complicated topics  <br>00:11:04.200 but what I really like about the short  <br>00:11:06.079 form AI is the fact that it also offers  <br>00:11:08.519 additional sources that are linked to  <br>00:11:10.560 give an opportunity to learn further and  <br>00:11:12.880 gain well-rounded understandings on the  <br>00:11:14.959 subjects access to the AI extension is  <br>00:11:17.120 free but with limited accessibility and  <br>00:11:19.120 full capabilities are available with the  <br>00:11:21.120 premium subscription to short form new  <br>00:11:22.920 and existing paid premium users gain  <br>00:11:25.000 full access to the extension and short  <br>00:11:27.279 forms high quality nonf book guides so  <br>00:11:31.240 give it a try you can actually get a 20%  <br>00:11:33.760 discount to a short form premium  <br>00:11:35.320 subscription which includes that  <br>00:11:37.079 unlimited access to the AI via my link  <br>00:11:39.519 short [form.com](http://form.com/)  <br>00:11:40.880 creating so thank you very much to  <br>00:11:42.880 shortform for sponsoring this part of  <br>00:11:44.519 the video right back to notion and these  <br>00:11:47.000 next sections are about improving the  <br>00:11:49.600 quality of your work better  <br>00:11:51.519 collaboration this is another way that  <br>00:11:53.639 I've been using notion wrong not  <br>00:11:55.639 embracing the collaboration tools even  <br>00:11:58.600 in a personal workspace first remember  <br>00:12:01.519 that you can invite guests by clicking  <br>00:12:04.920 share up here and you can do it for free  <br>00:12:07.839 so when you jump up here you can find  <br>00:12:10.800 someone's email so let's say I wanted to  <br>00:12:12.680 invite Tom here if I click add and  <br>00:12:15.880 invite Tom it will also ask you if you  <br>00:12:18.040 want to add him to your workspace don't  <br>00:12:20.279 do that because you will end up paying  <br>00:12:22.079 for them as a member always skip that  <br>00:12:24.519 but you can still give them full access  <br>00:12:26.600 to the page which is rather good the joy  <br>00:12:29.360 that is that you can share pages and  <br>00:12:32.120 then anything within those pages those  <br>00:12:34.240 people can see as well so for example if  <br>00:12:36.720 you were using say my life OS and you  <br>00:12:39.199 shared the life OS with a person they  <br>00:12:42.800 would be able to access all of the  <br>00:12:44.680 databases within that template and you  <br>00:12:47.120 could start using it as a shared  <br>00:12:49.000 workspace for free in notion as long as  <br>00:12:51.880 you don't add them as a member recently  <br>00:12:53.560 I've been doing a complete audit of my  <br>00:12:55.800 company my work my channel and so on and  <br>00:12:58.040 so forth with an in company called the  <br>00:13:00.079 generalist Co we're doing a huge amount  <br>00:13:02.199 of work but what's really cool is that  <br>00:13:04.440 we're actually doing some commentary on  <br>00:13:06.839 things I really think you should start  <br>00:13:08.480 embracing the use of comments with  <br>00:13:10.160 people the best way to do this is to for  <br>00:13:12.519 example highlight a subject and then  <br>00:13:15.000 just click comment by using a at mention  <br>00:13:18.240 I can find my colleague Debs and I can  <br>00:13:20.680 say just showing the audience how to use  <br>00:13:24.199 comments in notion and send it and then  <br>00:13:27.839 people can reply underneath and once  <br>00:13:30.639 it's completed you can resolve it and it  <br>00:13:34.040 will disappear I've always avoided it  <br>00:13:35.760 but it's actually an excellent way to  <br>00:13:37.560 work with a guest collaborator did you  <br>00:13:39.320 know that you can use AI to generate  <br>00:13:42.440 visual data here's a little example I've  <br>00:13:44.839 created this prompt create a pie chart  <br>00:13:47.760 using mermaid which is a chart creation  <br>00:13:50.519 system you have to name the type of  <br>00:13:52.199 chart you want so I'm going to copy that  <br>00:13:54.000 paste it into Ai and press enter and  <br>00:13:56.320 watch this it will create the pie chart  <br>00:14:01.000 using Mermaid so if you can find a way  <br>00:14:03.120 to insert data and update that yourself  <br>00:14:06.519 this is a great quick way into learning  <br>00:14:08.600 to use mermaid and have data  <br>00:14:10.399 visualization in your workspace give it  <br>00:14:12.680 a go and finally chatting with your  <br>00:14:14.800 notion workspace now a lot of people  <br>00:14:17.440 down here might see this little button  <br>00:14:19.320 or you might see a sign up to the  <br>00:14:21.320 waiting list I recommend doing it  <br>00:14:23.240 because you can try this on a free  <br>00:14:24.639 account so this is the AI system so look  <br>00:14:28.079 it says hi Simon ask me about anything  <br>00:14:30.079 in better creating I'll find the answer  <br>00:14:32.639 and be able to help you do things I've  <br>00:14:34.600 only just realized the power of this  <br>00:14:36.560 it's like having a personal researcher  <br>00:14:39.079 within your workspace that can help you  <br>00:14:41.240 find things and do a lot of stuff what  <br>00:14:43.720 makes this special and different to  <br>00:14:45.279 something like chat GPT is that Q&A  <br>00:14:48.600 bases all its answers on the information  <br>00:14:51.120 in your workspace rather than the wider  <br>00:14:53.360 web this is a super powerful use case  <br>00:14:56.079 for it because it will only look for  <br>00:14:58.199 things you've got and not go wider so  <br>00:15:00.720 number one you could search your  <br>00:15:02.320 knowledge base or project back catalog  <br>00:15:04.560 so what should we say about what do I  <br>00:15:07.519 know about the par method first of all  <br>00:15:13.440 what it's doing is finding the  <br>00:15:15.480 references and then it will actually  <br>00:15:18.000 give me some direct answers now if you  <br>00:15:20.399 don't know about par it's a system to  <br>00:15:22.560 manage your projects areas resources and  <br>00:15:25.360 archives within something like a second  <br>00:15:27.440 brain now you can see that it's found a  <br>00:15:30.360 number of different sources here and you  <br>00:15:32.160 can see it is showing me also the link  <br>00:15:36.319 to the file so I can jump to it and go  <br>00:15:39.639 back to that same file where all the  <br>00:15:41.360 information was this is super powerful  <br>00:15:43.880 this combination of citation and  <br>00:15:46.279 answering but what we could also say is  <br>00:15:48.720 what videos have I created on the  <br>00:15:52.680 subject check the content database now  <br>00:15:55.279 it's not as accurate as finding  <br>00:15:57.440 something within a database yet and it  <br>00:15:59.199 also can't recognize if you say current  <br>00:16:01.360 page whilst in beta but it has done a  <br>00:16:04.040 little bit of work here look my notion  <br>00:16:06.040 life OS second brain uh and a beginner's  <br>00:16:08.880 guide and it will show me some of those  <br>00:16:10.519 things not bad now what's really nice  <br>00:16:12.600 about this window is that it will stay  <br>00:16:14.560 with you as you navigate so if I go to  <br>00:16:17.959 other pages I can continue to look at  <br>00:16:20.360 this meaning that it kind of has a  <br>00:16:21.880 memory and I can work with it as I move  <br>00:16:24.839 through my system which I think is  <br>00:16:26.839 really powerful but the great thing  <br>00:16:28.279 about this is it also works within a  <br>00:16:30.360 page using ask AI so if we look at my  <br>00:16:32.800 script and find save to notion in here  <br>00:16:34.880 we were talking about earlier I can ask  <br>00:16:37.040 AI what do I know about this and I can  <br>00:16:41.560 say look you can see where I've  <br>00:16:43.600 mentioned it in a document in fact it's  <br>00:16:46.680 in this one and I can also see that I've  <br>00:16:49.399 talked about it in various different  <br>00:16:50.800 places if I jump to my knowledge and  <br>00:16:52.639 clippings I can see my books here if we  <br>00:16:55.199 jump into say the 4-Hour Work week we  <br>00:16:58.040 can find some very ious quotes that I've  <br>00:17:00.120 taken from readwise and my Kindle to  <br>00:17:02.800 drop it in there now let's say that I  <br>00:17:04.520 wanted to take a look at an idea within  <br>00:17:06.679 this something like money I can ask AI  <br>00:17:10.119 what materials do I have on this subject  <br>00:17:11.839 for a lot of the time this is really  <br>00:17:13.760 super powerful you've got to be precise  <br>00:17:15.480 about how you use it and to be honest  <br>00:17:16.959 whilst this is a great answer it's got  <br>00:17:18.679 stuck on the current page so I'm  <br>00:17:20.119 actually going to give it a thumbs  <br>00:17:22.319 down there you go and I fed back to  <br>00:17:24.559 notion the next example for using Q&A in  <br>00:17:27.079 this is about creating proposals for  <br>00:17:29.400 projects or outlines based on your wider  <br>00:17:31.960 knowledge based so I can ask the Q&A  <br>00:17:34.360 system to draw on my existing content to  <br>00:17:36.919 create an informed outline for  <br>00:17:39.559 example I'm going to try this you're an  <br>00:17:41.960 expert in online education and social  <br>00:17:43.600 media create proposal based on my recent  <br>00:17:45.480 video scripts and YouTube projects to  <br>00:17:48.039 propose an outline for a video course  <br>00:17:51.720 called part-time productivity 101 let's  <br>00:17:54.280 try  <br>00:17:56.880 it so what's really interesting about  <br>00:17:59.520 this is this has referenced a number of  <br>00:18:01.880 things now I think this is a brilliant  <br>00:18:03.679 example of how far you can take this  <br>00:18:06.960 it's given me a introduction brain dump  <br>00:18:10.039 time management habits and getting  <br>00:18:11.600 things done minimalist productivity blah  <br>00:18:14.039 blah blah and it's referencing a number  <br>00:18:16.799 of things that I've created so I've got  <br>00:18:18.480 my skillshare course that I'm planning  <br>00:18:20.440 it's also looked at a video where I  <br>00:18:22.480 talked about this it's also found future  <br>00:18:26.480 projects that I was planning how to stop  <br>00:18:28.480 proc procastinating an old video and  <br>00:18:30.520 it's got a complete notion productivity  <br>00:18:32.679 in 60 seconds so it's referencing all of  <br>00:18:34.960 those kind of Key Systems that I've used  <br>00:18:37.159 and bits of writing and turned it into  <br>00:18:39.360 that I'm going to be using that to  <br>00:18:41.039 create myself a skillshare course and  <br>00:18:43.720 work into it so if you already have paid  <br>00:18:45.760 for the notion AI add-on you should have  <br>00:18:48.000

example it has impact on visceral fat  <br>00:00:07.839 and that belly fat yeah it's the fat  <br>00:00:09.440 that's really bad for  <br>00:00:10.840 you yeah you're not supposed to do that  <br>00:00:13.799 Stephen oh gosh the glucose goddess is  <br>00:00:17.119 back Jesse enpay is a biochemist and  <br>00:00:19.640 best-selling author with a focus on  <br>00:00:21.359 nutrition and glucose management she  <br>00:00:23.080 provides simple science-backed tips to  <br>00:00:25.119 improve our health 80% of the population  <br>00:00:27.560 have glucose spikes every single day and  <br>00:00:29.640 that's when problems start happening  <br>00:00:30.920 from mental health to acne to faster  <br>00:00:32.558 aging infertility and PCOS which is one  <br>00:00:35.000 of the leading causes of infertility in  <br>00:00:36.760 women and the problem is we're in a  <br>00:00:38.280 situation where the food landscape is so  <br>00:00:40.000 toxic and most of us just eat sugar and  <br>00:00:42.160 starches but they're literally made up  <br>00:00:43.800 of glucose molecules is there any such  <br>00:00:45.520 thing as good sugar no so even all the  <br>00:00:48.079 fruit that we find today in supermarkets  <br>00:00:49.879 is not natural some people believe that  <br>00:00:51.600 if the sugar is coming from a fruit for  <br>00:00:53.320 example in a fruit smoothie that's good  <br>00:00:55.559 sugar but that's a total lie and your  <br>00:00:57.559 body doesn't differentiate but the sugar  <br>00:00:59.280 isn't a fruit smoothie or the sugars in  <br>00:01:00.600 a chocolate cake are there any foods  <br>00:01:02.160 that have surprised you when you tested  <br>00:01:03.680 them yes I think the biggest ones are  <br>00:01:07.119 wow this begs the question then is there  <br>00:01:09.040 a healthy way to consume sugar so these  <br>00:01:11.000 are four hacks that people can Implement  <br>00:01:13.159 in their lives and you're able to reduce  <br>00:01:14.720 your glucose spikes while still eating  <br>00:01:16.240 what you love and you took these hacks  <br>00:01:17.920 and did an experiment yes and 90% of  <br>00:01:20.360 people reduce their Cravings really  <br>00:01:22.000 significant impacts on sleep hormones  <br>00:01:24.560 mood on diabetes and it says roughly 40%  <br>00:01:27.119 of people who wanted to lose weight did  <br>00:01:28.520 in fact lose weight yep so what are the  <br>00:01:30.640 hacks the first one  <br>00:01:34.200 is this is a sentence I never thought  <br>00:01:36.880 I'd say in my life um we've just hit 7  <br>00:01:39.200 million subscribers on YouTube and I  <br>00:01:40.759 want to say a huge thank you to all of  <br>00:01:42.360 you that show up here every Monday and  <br>00:01:44.520

<br>00:02:27.200 conversation Jesse in chasby the glucose  <br>00:02:30.800 goddess we spoke two years ago and in  <br>00:02:34.599 that time I feel like there's been a  <br>00:02:36.360 real glucose Revolution much of which  <br>00:02:38.879 has been led by you your books have sold  <br>00:02:40.720 millions and millions and millions of  <br>00:02:41.920 copies around the world your  <br>00:02:43.560 conversations online have millions and  <br>00:02:44.920 millions and millions and millions of  <br>00:02:45.920 views more than I could possibly  <br>00:02:47.879 count what's going on with glucose the  <br>00:02:51.360 thing is glucose has always been  <br>00:02:53.599 incredibly important to our health but  <br>00:02:56.200 it's been going on behind the scenes but  <br>00:02:59.599 now now but with the technology that we  <br>00:03:01.080 have glucose monitors new science we're  <br>00:03:03.440 actually able to get a real good handle  <br>00:03:05.040 on it and understand our diet through  <br>00:03:07.599 that lens so most of us Stephen have  <br>00:03:11.920 unhealthy glucose levels to give you an  <br>00:03:14.000 example one billion people in the world  <br>00:03:15.959 have either type two diabetes or  <br>00:03:17.959 pre-diabetes one billion and that number  <br>00:03:20.680 is increasing every single day and then  <br>00:03:22.840 in people who don't have any health  <br>00:03:24.400 issues up to 80% of the population still  <br>00:03:27.360 has glucose spikes every single day and  <br>00:03:30.319 this leads to lots of symptoms from  <br>00:03:31.959 mental health problems to fertility to  <br>00:03:33.760 acne to faster aging glucose is really  <br>00:03:36.400 important and I'm really happy that  <br>00:03:37.599 we're talking about it more what have  <br>00:03:39.319 you have you been surprised by how much  <br>00:03:41.239 people have woken up to glucose sugar  <br>00:03:44.120 yeah definitely I think even the word  <br>00:03:46.159 glucose people used to know blood sugar  <br>00:03:47.879 but now the fact that people know what  <br>00:03:49.080 glucose is makes me quite happy that's  <br>00:03:51.159 the scientific way to refer to blood  <br>00:03:53.640 sugar it's surprising but the thing is  <br>00:03:55.799 like I'm on the inside I'm working every  <br>00:03:57.599 single day to make sure people know what  <br>00:03:58.959 glucose is so it's like you know when  <br>00:04:01.079 you put the frog in the water and then  <br>00:04:02.560 you slowly boil the water you know that  <br>00:04:04.120 image and the Frog doesn't notice the  <br>00:04:05.560 water is boiling that's how I feel  <br>00:04:07.120 because I've been doing this for five  <br>00:04:08.720 years now so I can tell now if I compare  <br>00:04:11.720 today to five years ago there's been a  <br>00:04:13.200 huge shift but I've been looking at it  <br>00:04:15.319 every single day day by day and the  <br>00:04:17.798 increase has been very gradual how do  <br>00:04:20.600 you define yourself there's this sort of  <br>00:04:23.840 name you go under the glucose goddess  <br>00:04:26.080 but professionally if someone says what  <br>00:04:28.840 you do H how do you define that I say  <br>00:04:31.039 I'm a biochemist I'm a biochemist  <br>00:04:34.039 passionate about sharing science in a  <br>00:04:36.320 fun accessible sexy way that's what I  <br>00:04:38.080 like to do these cgms continuous glucose  <br>00:04:41.400 monitors that everybody seems to be  <br>00:04:43.240 wearing these days they're much of the  <br>00:04:46.720 the reason people I guess know you  <br>00:04:51.759 because you post these incredible graphs  <br>00:04:53.520 on your Instagram showing the impact  <br>00:04:55.479 that of the things we on our glucose  <br>00:04:58.479 levels yeah I want to start there when I  <br>00:05:01.520 eat something sweet and full of sugar  <br>00:05:04.199 there's a spike in my CGM so my  <br>00:05:06.880 continuous glucose monitor does does the  <br>00:05:09.520 spike mean that something bad is going  <br>00:05:12.360 on in my body kind of yeah so I'll go  <br>00:05:16.919 just one step back there's lots of  <br>00:05:19.319 different categories of foods but there  <br>00:05:20.960 are two that impact our blood sugar  <br>00:05:23.039 levels it's starches so that's bread  <br>00:05:26.479 rice pasta potatoes oats and sugars so  <br>00:05:30.479 anything sweet from an apple pie turn  <br>00:05:32.960 orange juice these two categories of  <br>00:05:35.120 foods they're literally made up of  <br>00:05:36.919 glucose molecules so when you eat them  <br>00:05:39.280 they break down into individual glucose  <br>00:05:41.039 molecules and the glucose molecules  <br>00:05:42.639 arrive into your blood if you eat a lot  <br>00:05:44.840 of starches and sugars at once a lot of  <br>00:05:46.919 glucose molecules are arriving into your  <br>00:05:48.600 blood and that's what you see that's the  <br>00:05:50.680 spike you see on your glucose monitor  <br>00:05:53.800 now these Spikes have a few different  <br>00:05:56.880 consequences you know having a few  <br>00:05:58.800 spikes here and there is not not a big  <br>00:06:00.000 deal but if you have really big spikes  <br>00:06:01.919 which I think most of us are discovering  <br>00:06:03.319 we have even if we don't have diabetes  <br>00:06:05.360 that's when problems start happening  <br>00:06:06.919 there's basically three processes that  <br>00:06:08.440 take place in your body when you spike  <br>00:06:10.639 it's chronic fatigue of your  <br>00:06:12.520 mitochondria aging glycation and then  <br>00:06:15.720 insulin release and I can go into detail  <br>00:06:18.000 into these but these are what underpin  <br>00:06:20.319 all the negative consequences of glucose  <br>00:06:22.400 spikes so start with that first one okay  <br>00:06:24.599 the mitochondria so there's these little  <br>00:06:26.800 factories in your cells that are in  <br>00:06:28.280 charge of making energy you must have  <br>00:06:29.800 learned this at school you know the  <br>00:06:30.919 mitochondria is the factory of the cell  <br>00:06:34.000 these little mitochondria are constantly  <br>00:06:36.160 trying to make energy for your body and  <br>00:06:38.919 they turn glucose into energy so you  <br>00:06:41.680 give them glucose through food they turn  <br>00:06:43.199 it into energy and then your brain uses  <br>00:06:45.479 the energy your heart to pump your ears  <br>00:06:47.680 to listen your eyes to see your whole  <br>00:06:50.080 body uses this energy and so you might  <br>00:06:52.440 think okay I want lots of energy so I  <br>00:06:54.479 should give my mitochondria lots of  <br>00:06:55.800 glucose That's The Logical conclusion  <br>00:06:57.960 you might come to but that where it  <br>00:06:59.919 completely collapses see biology is a  <br>00:07:01.639 bit weird take the example of a plant do  <br>00:07:04.319 you have any plants at home I do yeah  <br>00:07:05.919 okay are you able to keep them alive um  <br>00:07:08.319 my cleaning does a great job of keeping  <br>00:07:09.639 all them alive I have a super hard time  <br>00:07:12.560 but the reason I'm bringing up plants is  <br>00:07:14.440 because you know that plants need some  <br>00:07:15.919 water to live but if you give them too  <br>00:07:18.360 much water they drown and they die the  <br>00:07:21.240 human body is kind of the same some  <br>00:07:23.520 glucose amazing steady energy too much  <br>00:07:26.520 glucose and your little mitochondria  <br>00:07:28.680 start freaking out out they get  <br>00:07:30.960 overwhelmed by too much glucose Reviving  <br>00:07:33.240 their way they kind of go on strike and  <br>00:07:35.319 I'm French so I know but they sort of go  <br>00:07:37.560 on strike and they get overwhelmed and  <br>00:07:39.280 stressed out and they're not able to  <br>00:07:40.800 make energy effectively anymore because  <br>00:07:42.599 we're overloading them with too much  <br>00:07:44.960 glucose to process and as a human what  <br>00:07:47.960 do you feel you feel chronic fatigue you  <br>00:07:50.879 wake up you're exhausted thinking of  <br>00:07:52.599 going to the grocery store or picking up  <br>00:07:54.039 your kids is super tiring there's this  <br>00:07:57.720 Energy System in your body is just kind  <br>00:07:59.360 of of broken but you keep eating carbs  <br>00:08:01.639 you know croissant some bread something  <br>00:08:03.960 sweet but you keep being more and more  <br>00:08:05.919 tired that's your mitochondria  <br>00:08:08.080 dysfunctioning so that's the first thing  <br>00:08:09.960 that happens when you spike you get  <br>00:08:11.960 tired your mitochondria gets stressed  <br>00:08:16.199 out and one thing that's interesting is  <br>00:08:19.120 that sometimes when we eat something  <br>00:08:20.520 sweet especially in the morning like an  <br>00:08:21.879 orange juice we kind of feel a sense of  <br>00:08:25.520 like a like a rush of energy you know  <br>00:08:27.120 you have a big glass of orange juice and  <br>00:08:28.639 you sort of perk up for a sec most  <br>00:08:30.639 people think that that is energy what's  <br>00:08:33.159 actually going on is that Sugar releases  <br>00:08:35.640 dopamine in the brain and it's the  <br>00:08:37.679 pleasure molecule it's the same molecule  <br>00:08:39.440 that gets released when you have sex  <br>00:08:41.159 when you play video games when you do  <br>00:08:43.159 illegal drugs sugar releases dopamine  <br>00:08:46.080 it's pleasure it makes you kind of feel  <br>00:08:48.279 awake just briefly but actually that's  <br>00:08:50.800 not energy because on the inside your  <br>00:08:52.519 mitochondria are being damaged so we're  <br>00:08:54.640 being tricked by sugary foods and when  <br>00:08:56.399 we're tired we often reach for something  <br>00:08:58.600 sugary to per us up but it doesn't work  <br>00:09:00.720 on the inside so that's the first thing  <br>00:09:03.040 your mitochondria gets stressed out and  <br>00:09:05.600 as your mitochondria gets stressed out  <br>00:09:07.040 they also release what's called free  <br>00:09:08.480 radicals which is something that  <br>00:09:10.040 increases inflammation in the body and  <br>00:09:11.680 inflammation is really nasty thing we'll  <br>00:09:14.120 get to it in a sec the second thing that  <br>00:09:16.160 happens when you spike has to do with a  <br>00:09:18.440 chicken cooking in the oven so if you  <br>00:09:21.079 put you're looking at me weird but let  <br>00:09:22.399 me explain if you put a chicken in the  <br>00:09:25.000 oven it goes from pink to brown right  <br>00:09:28.600 you've seen this it books this process  <br>00:09:31.120 of cooking is called glycation it's the  <br>00:09:34.399 process of Browning or of cooking same  <br>00:09:37.040 thing when you toast a piece of toast  <br>00:09:38.399 for  <br>00:09:39.200 example the interesting thing is a human  <br>00:09:42.360 being from the moment we're born we're  <br>00:09:44.720 slowly cooking in that same way on the  <br>00:09:48.240 inside we're slowly glycating we're  <br>00:09:50.920 slowly Browning and then when we're  <br>00:09:53.720 fully glycated when we're fully cooked  <br>00:09:57.079 we die that's why when you look at the  <br>00:09:59.800 cartilage of babies it's white and if  <br>00:10:02.040 you look at the cartilage of somebody  <br>00:10:03.320 who's 90 years old it's brown they've  <br>00:10:05.600 cooked on the inside and every glucose  <br>00:10:08.279 Spike increases you're looking at your  <br>00:10:10.160 skin yeah from the outside we'd have to  <br>00:10:13.600 like open you up and look at your  <br>00:10:14.800 cartilage color got about 10 minutes  <br>00:10:18.839 left and every glucose Spike increases  <br>00:10:21.320 his process of glycation so much so that  <br>00:10:23.600 glucose and glycation they kind of sound  <br>00:10:26.120 like a similar word glucose glyc a it's  <br>00:10:30.440 because it's glucose doing the glycating  <br>00:10:33.920 so every glucose Spike increases  <br>00:10:36.519 glycation increases cooking accelerates  <br>00:10:39.519 aging and this shows on your skin you  <br>00:10:42.639 get wrinkles faster if you glycate more  <br>00:10:44.880 and also on the inside your organs  <br>00:10:47.079 slowly get damaged so glucose spikes  <br>00:10:50.200 mitochondria get tired you age  <br>00:10:53.320 faster in response to this your body  <br>00:10:56.480 knows Stephen that a big glucose spike  <br>00:10:58.880 is not good for you your body knows that  <br>00:11:01.279 it has to do something to try to get  <br>00:11:03.000 that glucose level down so what it does  <br>00:11:05.880 it calls up your pancreas and it's like  <br>00:11:08.000 yo pancreas we got a glucose bike going  <br>00:11:09.880 on we need to get this glucose down in  <br>00:11:12.839 response your pancreas sends a hormone  <br>00:11:14.880 called insulin out in your body you've  <br>00:11:17.079 heard of insulin before right and  <br>00:11:19.320 insulin's job and we love her her job is  <br>00:11:21.680 to grab all these excess glucose  <br>00:11:24.079 molecules and to store them away so they  <br>00:11:27.480 don't damage your body anymore and  <br>00:11:29.760 Insulin stores glucose away into your  <br>00:11:32.560 liver into your muscles and then when  <br>00:11:35.600 those are full insulin stores glucose  <br>00:11:38.000 away into your fat cells and that's one  <br>00:11:41.120 of the ways that you gain fat on your  <br>00:11:43.680 body it's in response to the spikes and  <br>00:11:46.000 your body trying to protect you from the  <br>00:11:48.079 spikes the problem is insulin itself has  <br>00:11:51.680 consequences and is the driver of type  <br>00:11:54.160 two diabetes and insulin resistance so  <br>00:11:56.600 to answer your question yes when you see  <br>00:11:58.480 a big spike on your glucose monitor  <br>00:12:00.600 there's some of that going on and the  <br>00:12:02.320 more spikes you have the harder it is  <br>00:12:04.120 going to be for your body to manage your  <br>00:12:05.680 spikes so it kind of becomes a vicious  <br>00:12:07.600 cycle if you keep eating the same way  <br>00:12:09.519 your spice will get bigger and bigger  <br>00:12:11.120 and bigger and bigger over time with  <br>00:12:12.760 more and more damage on that last point  <br>00:12:14.880 about where insulin stores the excess  <br>00:12:17.720 glucose does that mean that if I have  <br>00:12:19.279 more muscle mass I'm better at eating  <br>00:12:23.680 sugary products yep and that's why if  <br>00:12:26.480 you really love cookies the best time to  <br>00:12:28.399 eat them is right after you work out  <br>00:12:30.199 right before you work out because your  <br>00:12:32.120 muscles are really hungry for glucose  <br>00:12:33.880 all the time and the bigger your muscles  <br>00:12:35.440 are the more you use them the more  <br>00:12:37.440 they're going to capture some of that  <br>00:12:38.880 glucose for energy okay so me and my  <br>00:12:41.639 partner we both go to the gym she is  <br>00:12:43.440 significantly smaller than me in every  <br>00:12:44.639 way she's she's short she's you know  <br>00:12:47.279 she's lean um I'm bigger than her I have  <br>00:12:50.399 I have more muscle mass that means that  <br>00:12:52.480 if I have one cookie and she has the  <br>00:12:54.199 exact same cookie then her glucose  <br>00:12:56.680 response is going to be potentially  <br>00:12:58.000 significantly different to mine  <br>00:12:59.959 yes potentially so if you just look at  <br>00:13:02.000 muscle mass since you have more muscle  <br>00:13:03.639 mass you'll be able to handle that  <br>00:13:04.920 cookie better but there's so many things  <br>00:13:07.079 that influence glucose response for  <br>00:13:08.800 example your level of hydration how  <br>00:13:11.240 stressed you are your microbiome your  <br>00:13:13.279 genetics what time of the month you're  <br>00:13:14.920 in when you're female how well you've  <br>00:13:17.240 slept last night I mean there's a few  <br>00:13:19.560 factors so if you were just to compare  <br>00:13:21.360 your Spike to hers you couldn't really  <br>00:13:23.399 draw any conclusions because there's so  <br>00:13:25.720 many confounding variables there's  <br>00:13:28.000 confounding variables give me a window  <br>00:13:29.839 into some of them and why they matter  <br>00:13:31.360 and how they have an impact on my  <br>00:13:32.440 glucose  <br>00:13:33.440 response so I think muscles is a really  <br>00:13:35.839 good example right if two people eat the  <br>00:13:37.680 same exact cookie the person with more  <br>00:13:39.680 muscle mass is going to potentially see  <br>00:13:41.680 a smaller glucose Spike because their  <br>00:13:43.800 muscles are going to absorb more of that  <br>00:13:45.480 glucose and faster if you look at  <br>00:13:48.120 genetics some people are better at  <br>00:13:50.560 growing their fat cells and at growing  <br>00:13:52.680 the number and the size of their fat  <br>00:13:54.440 cells so they have a bigger Reservoir to  <br>00:13:57.160 put glucose in people of South Asian  <br>00:13:59.399 descent for example they tend to have a  <br>00:14:01.399 harder time putting on fat cells and as  <br>00:14:04.240 a result their glucose spikes tend to be  <br>00:14:06.360 bigger because they don't have that  <br>00:14:07.839 storage unit that they can access and  <br>00:14:10.320 increase the size of does that make  <br>00:14:11.880 sense yeah yeah yeah are there any foods  <br>00:14:15.399 that you have been surprised at when  <br>00:14:17.920 you've tested them because this is one  <br>00:14:19.680 of the really shocking things that I  <br>00:14:22.240 discovered when I wore a continuous  <br>00:14:23.360 glucose monitor is I would eat some  <br>00:14:25.759 things that I've been eating for a long  <br>00:14:27.839 long time and they would cause a spike  <br>00:14:29.839 and I like what I thought that was  <br>00:14:31.199 healthy yeah um but what are those  <br>00:14:33.600 things I guess for the suris the  <br>00:14:35.240 surprising ones not just for you but for  <br>00:14:36.880 people that message you and go oh my God  <br>00:14:38.639 Jesse I've been lied to about my tomato  <br>00:14:40.839 ketchup or okay I think the biggest ones  <br>00:14:42.959 are honey and grapes okay so grapes  <br>00:14:46.680 first you think it's a fruit it's  <br>00:14:49.399 healthy it's natural it's good for me  <br>00:14:51.120 right well actually all the fruit that  <br>00:14:53.519 we find today in supermarkets is not  <br>00:14:55.440 natural it is the product of human  <br>00:14:58.320 breeding for thousands and thousands of  <br>00:15:00.160 years to make them extra sweet extra  <br>00:15:02.519 juicy in the same way that humans have  <br>00:15:04.600 been breeding dogs from the time of the  <br>00:15:06.720 gray wolves into Chihuahua and Golden  <br>00:15:09.199 Retrievers these are not natural types  <br>00:15:11.880 of dogs we've bred wolves into these  <br>00:15:14.240 dogs fruit is the same thing we've bred  <br>00:15:17.360 pces of fruit to make these beautiful  <br>00:15:19.759 grapes without any seeds and just this  <br>00:15:22.199 little pocket of sugar and so a grape  <br>00:15:24.199 when you look at it actually it's just a  <br>00:15:26.199 big dose of sugar it's in the fruit  <br>00:15:29.199 format so people think it's good for  <br>00:15:30.480 them but actually when it comes to your  <br>00:15:31.680 glucose levels it's just big glucose  <br>00:15:34.360 Spike so those are really surprising all  <br>00:15:37.399 fruits it varies right so for example  <br>00:15:40.639 berries are lower in Sugar so create a  <br>00:15:43.120 smaller Spike but any tropical fruit  <br>00:15:45.600 like bananas mangoes papayas and then  <br>00:15:48.440 grapes also those are really high in  <br>00:15:50.279 sugar yeah but the thing is you know  <br>00:15:51.880 piece of whole fruit is okay because it  <br>00:15:54.079 has fiber in it the real problem comes  <br>00:15:56.759 when you denature that piece of fruit  <br>00:15:58.360 and you turn it into a juice for example  <br>00:16:00.639 cuz then you're removing that protective  <br>00:16:02.279 fiber just extracting the water and the  <br>00:16:04.480 sugar yeah I've not drank a glass of  <br>00:16:06.440 juice since starting this podcast  <br>00:16:07.959 because so many people have spoken to  <br>00:16:09.240 have told me that it's just like  <br>00:16:10.199 drinking sugar water yeah it's just like  <br>00:16:11.959 drinking a can of Coke but people think  <br>00:16:13.360 well it comes from a piece of fruit so  <br>00:16:15.240 it's natural orange juice comes from  <br>00:16:16.959 oranges therefore it's good for you  <br>00:16:18.920 because it's natural what they don't  <br>00:16:20.319 realize is that the sugar in a can of  <br>00:16:22.600 soda is also natural it comes from sugar  <br>00:16:25.639 beets or canes so if you're you're  <br>00:16:29.079 really looking at the source of the  <br>00:16:30.279 sugar you realize it doesn't matter at  <br>00:16:31.759 all they all come from plants what  <br>00:16:33.319 matters is the concentration and the  <br>00:16:35.240 medium that the sugar is in I understand  <br>00:16:38.600 grapes causing a glucose Spike because  <br>00:16:40.720 when I taste it it tastes sweet but  <br>00:16:43.079 there's some things that I eat that  <br>00:16:44.519 don't taste sweet that cause a glucose  <br>00:16:46.480 Spike and those are the things that I  <br>00:16:48.120 think lie to me like bread like bread  <br>00:16:50.560 like rice yeah well the thing is glucose  <br>00:16:53.399 is actually not sweet what you're  <br>00:16:55.279 tasting in fruit is fructose so let me  <br>00:16:58.199 explain so starches like bread pasta  <br>00:17:02.040 rice potatoes  <br>00:17:04.119 oats those are starches those are  <br>00:17:06.679 literally millions of glucose molecules  <br>00:17:09.439 just attached hand to hand like this  <br>00:17:12.359 that's a starch it's just a long chain  <br>00:17:14.000 of glucose when you eat the starch poof  <br>00:17:16.480 it turns into individual glucose  <br>00:17:17.880 molecules raises your blood sugar even  <br>00:17:19.959 though it doesn't taste sweet in a piece  <br>00:17:22.199 of fruit or in Sugar you're not eating  <br>00:17:24.839 starch what you're eating is sucrose  <br>00:17:27.599 different kind of molecule which which  <br>00:17:28.960 is half glucose half  <br>00:17:32.160 fructose yeah so when it breaks down it  <br>00:17:34.679 gives you glucose and a spike but also  <br>00:17:36.880 fructose that tastes really sweet but  <br>00:17:39.559 doesn't raise your blood sugar levels  <br>00:17:41.080 that much so again on the other side of  <br>00:17:43.480 the queen then are there foods that  <br>00:17:45.360 taste sweet but don't have an impact on  <br>00:17:47.000 my glucose yes  <br>00:17:48.919 sweeteners Stevia aspartame things like  <br>00:17:51.960 that so you saying that I should put  <br>00:17:54.880 sweeters in my food as opposed to Sugar  <br>00:17:58.240 well I think people need to realize that  <br>00:18:00.120 even though sweeteners are not super  <br>00:18:01.440 good for us right of course it's better  <br>00:18:02.960 to drink water than a diet soda the diet  <br>00:18:05.720 soda is better for you than the regular  <br>00:18:07.760 can of soda with the 30 grams of real  <br>00:18:09.880 sugar in there I personally would never  <br>00:18:13.200 have a can of real soda I would always  <br>00:18:15.159 have the diet soda always always always  <br>00:18:17.760 because those sweeteners don't raise  <br>00:18:20.159 your blood sugar levels okay they don't  <br>00:18:22.159 create that big spike and that big  <br>00:18:23.559 insulin Spike and then the drop is there  <br>00:18:26.200 such a good thing as good sugar m  <br>00:18:29.960 is there any such thing as good  <br>00:18:31.919 sugar  <br>00:18:33.520 no people often believe that if the  <br>00:18:36.400 sugar is coming from a fruit and is is  <br>00:18:38.640 for example in a fruit smoothie that  <br>00:18:40.440 they might have in the morning that's  <br>00:18:41.960 good sugar but that Sugar that's in a  <br>00:18:43.520 cake is bad sugar so people tend to  <br>00:18:46.960 compare these two and say oh well I'm  <br>00:18:49.159 having a fruit smoothie that's good for  <br>00:18:50.520 me but oh that chocolate cake would be  <br>00:18:52.080 bad for me that's a total lie it's all  <br>00:18:54.600 the same molecules the molecules in that  <br>00:18:57.039 fruit smoothie and the molecules in that  <br>00:18:59.039 chocolate cake are the same it's sucrose  <br>00:19:01.360 it's the same stuff and your body  <br>00:19:02.960 doesn't differentiate whether the sugar  <br>00:19:05.280 is in a fruit smoothie or the sugar is  <br>00:19:06.760 in a chocolate cake so all sugar is the  <br>00:19:09.679 same even you know honey Agave maple  <br>00:19:12.919 syrup all these things that have these  <br>00:19:14.520 Health Halos because of marketing it's  <br>00:19:16.440 all the same molecules so I recommend  <br>00:19:19.240 that people just have the sugar that  <br>00:19:20.600 they like best don't think that one is  <br>00:19:22.880 going to be better for you than the  <br>00:19:24.039 other and have all sugar as dessert so  <br>00:19:26.960 that fruit smoothie that's also dessert  <br>00:19:28.720 dessert it's not super healthy because  <br>00:19:30.400 it comes from fruits it's just like the  <br>00:19:31.880 chocolate cake and are there is there  <br>00:19:34.080 such a thing as good sweetness and bad  <br>00:19:36.000 sweetness yeah so there's a few  <br>00:19:37.400 categories so the ones that seem to be  <br>00:19:39.320 really fine for us are Stevia monk fruit  <br>00:19:43.039 and allulose the ones that have been  <br>00:19:45.799 linked to quite a few health issues are  <br>00:19:48.960 aspartame ml sucralose so for example a  <br>00:19:53.440 Spartan you usually find it in soda  <br>00:19:55.679 whereas Stevia you might buy a little  <br>00:19:57.320 packet at home and put it in your tea  <br>00:19:59.880 that being said the spart tame is still  <br>00:20:02.799 better for you than the real can of coke  <br>00:20:04.840 with a 30 grams of real sugar so Stevia  <br>00:20:06.960 is something that I shouldn't be no  <br>00:20:08.760 Stevia is good yeah you shouldn't be too  <br>00:20:10.159 concern do you use Stevia I didn't put  <br>00:20:12.039 any Sweetness in anything I didn't put  <br>00:20:13.440 sugar in anything either so I'm trying  <br>00:20:15.240 to stay away have coffee it's just black  <br>00:20:17.000 coffee you don't even eat chocolate of  <br>00:20:19.080 course I chocolate maybe not so much  <br>00:20:21.320 maybe that's not my thing but what's  <br>00:20:23.400 your sweet thing carrot cake what's your  <br>00:20:26.240 sweet thing oh chocolate I love  <br>00:20:28.120 chocolate like my favorite is is like  <br>00:20:29.960 chocolate ice cream with a chocolate  <br>00:20:31.480 brownie and chocolate sauce and  <br>00:20:32.960 chocolate sprinkles anything chocolate  <br>00:20:35.039 that's not very glucose godess well  <br>00:20:37.159 here's where you're wrong Stephen I'm  <br>00:20:38.640 actually not anti- sugar what are you  <br>00:20:40.320 talking about no I love sugar I eat  <br>00:20:42.840 sugar I eat carbs all the time but I  <br>00:20:44.679 want people to know what I know which is  <br>00:20:47.440 how and when to eat those things that's  <br>00:20:49.159 the end of the podcast thank you so much  <br>00:20:51.600 really great to see you  <br>00:20:54.360 again seriously we need to learn how to  <br>00:20:57.480 eat these things cuz they're so  <br>00:20:58.679 delicious in a way that's less bad for  <br>00:21:00.200 our health it's not about cutting them  <br>00:21:01.559 out that would be a diet I don't I'm not  <br>00:21:03.320 I'm not pro diets I'm Pro knowledge and  <br>00:21:06.039 I want to make sure people are not  <br>00:21:06.960 having sugar and dessert for breakfast  <br>00:21:09.000 you know sweet cereal in the morning and  <br>00:21:10.799 orange juice that's dessert anyway I'm  <br>00:21:13.840 all about just trying to empower people  <br>00:21:15.159 with the information so they don't get  <br>00:21:16.840 trapped by these marketing lies are we  <br>00:21:20.120 meant to be eating the amounts of sugar  <br>00:21:22.400 that we eat though like are we meant to  <br>00:21:24.039 be eating any sugar is what does our  <br>00:21:26.080 sort of evolutionary history tell us  <br>00:21:27.600 about our relationship with glucose I  <br>00:21:29.559 think fruit is something we're meant to  <br>00:21:31.279 be eating but the fruit that used to  <br>00:21:32.840 exist was less sweet and harder to  <br>00:21:35.600 digest and more fibrous and then in  <br>00:21:37.440 terms of starches starches are totally  <br>00:21:39.200 fine to eat the problem is today most of  <br>00:21:41.200 us just eat sugar and starches we've  <br>00:21:43.480 completely lost touch with the nice  <br>00:21:46.000 proteins and the organ meats and the  <br>00:21:48.320 fiber and the healthy fats we're in a  <br>00:21:50.360 situation where the food landscape is so  <br>00:21:52.120 toxic and it's so just starches and  <br>00:21:54.400 sugars that people are getting sicker  <br>00:21:55.760 and sicker and sicker and it's addictive  <br>00:21:58.080 and it's cheap so we're in a very  <br>00:22:00.600 difficult situation and that's the  <br>00:22:02.080 situation that you know the gp1s are  <br>00:22:03.880 trying to solve we're in a pickle we are  <br>00:22:06.360 in a pickle are you optimistic about the  <br>00:22:08.960 pickle we're in as it relates to sugar  <br>00:22:10.679 and  <br>00:22:13.880 Creos I have to say yes because the  <br>00:22:16.400 amount of Transformations I see in my  <br>00:22:18.919 readers is really encouraging you know  <br>00:22:21.320 people are reclaiming their health  <br>00:22:22.679 getting power over it understanding food  <br>00:22:25.200 again but we've got a lot of work to do  <br>00:22:27.400 and I can do my work educating people  <br>00:22:29.400 from the ground up on these hacks but we  <br>00:22:31.159 also need like systemic change we need  <br>00:22:33.039 policy we need governments to get  <br>00:22:35.320 involved and we need to find ways to  <br>00:22:37.320 make healthier food because we're just  <br>00:22:38.799 killing the population right now it's  <br>00:22:40.279 really terrible so talking about some of  <br>00:22:42.960 the consequences of a high glucose diet  <br>00:22:47.679 one of them you mentioned earlier when  <br>00:22:48.919 we were talking about glycation is  <br>00:22:51.360 aging has anyone ever done any research  <br>00:22:54.000 to prove that a high glucose diet is  <br>00:22:57.279 associated with correlated with  <br>00:23:00.279 increased or accelerated aging I mean  <br>00:23:03.159 yes because we see that the people who  <br>00:23:04.720 eat the most sugar get the most diseases  <br>00:23:08.240 right so we see correlations but they're  <br>00:23:09.919 not they're not like a clinical trial  <br>00:23:11.600 you can't take two populations and say  <br>00:23:13.440 okay everybody's 30 years old we're  <br>00:23:15.279 going to give this half a healthy no  <br>00:23:17.679 glucose Spike diet and this half glucose  <br>00:23:19.919 spikes every single day and then we'll  <br>00:23:21.480 see when they're 80 you know which group  <br>00:23:23.279 has aged faster we can't do that that's  <br>00:23:25.200 unethical so we have to look at  <br>00:23:27.039 correlations and we see things like if  <br>00:23:29.600 you have really high glucose levels High  <br>00:23:31.440 insulin levels you're more likely to get  <br>00:23:33.080 heart disease dementia depression etc  <br>00:23:36.360 etc we have correlative studies and we  <br>00:23:39.600 understand the mechanism of the  <br>00:23:41.080 glycation what about the superficial  <br>00:23:43.120 signs of aging wrinkles like the  <br>00:23:45.200 wrinkles a lot of skincare products  <br>00:23:47.440 actually Target glycation from the  <br>00:23:48.880 outside in so they'll put like  <br>00:23:50.360 antioxidants on your skin to reduce  <br>00:23:52.760 glycation if you're in the skincare  <br>00:23:54.200 World you'll see glycation mentioned  <br>00:23:55.760 everywhere what they don't do is they  <br>00:23:57.720 don't look at at how to reduce glycation  <br>00:24:00.320 from the inside out which is what I  <br>00:24:02.720 think is more interesting and it's  <br>00:24:04.279 through food by reducing your glucose  <br>00:24:06.000 levels you reduce glycation it's just  <br>00:24:08.000 like a A to B it's very simple so if I  <br>00:24:11.440 want to Stave off wrinkles then I should  <br>00:24:14.400 keep my glucose levels down yes and you  <br>00:24:16.559 should also avoid smoking you know wear  <br>00:24:18.720 sunscreen Etc but in terms of your diet  <br>00:24:20.960 what you want to focus on is focus on  <br>00:24:22.600 reducing glucose spikes yeah absolutely  <br>00:24:24.799 what about things like acne and skin  <br>00:24:26.799 conditions so those are more  <br>00:24:28.480 inflammatory based diseases so eczema  <br>00:24:31.720 psoriasis acne rosacea those are  <br>00:24:35.200 expressions of inflammation going on  <br>00:24:38.159 within your body and I like to think of  <br>00:24:39.720 the skin as a mirror to what's going on  <br>00:24:42.799 within and so inflamation can happen to  <br>00:24:45.600 loads of different factors but one of  <br>00:24:47.120 the factors is glucose spikes so glucose  <br>00:24:49.520 spikes hurt our mitochondria that  <br>00:24:51.840 creates inflammation then glucose spikes  <br>00:24:54.279 lead to glycation which also leads to  <br>00:24:56.159 inflammation and Insulin release and a  <br>00:24:58.600 lot of insulin also increases  <br>00:25:00.279 inflammation so with every glucose Spike  <br>00:25:02.200 you're increasing inflammation within  <br>00:25:04.320 your body and if you're susceptible to  <br>00:25:06.279 any of these skin conditions you can  <br>00:25:07.679 have fups or increase their intensity  <br>00:25:09.679 very simply and does it also have an  <br>00:25:12.640 impact on my hormonal balance I am a lot  <br>00:25:15.640 of my friends I'm in that age range now  <br>00:25:17.039 where a lot of my friends are trying to  <br>00:25:18.320 have children yeah and there's so much  <br>00:25:21.120 talk around things like polycystic ovary  <br>00:25:23.960 syndrome and fertility and you know  <br>00:25:27.720 infertility in men with their sperm and  <br>00:25:29.440 all these kinds of things is there a  <br>00:25:30.760 link between glucose and hormones and  <br>00:25:34.039 fertility yes so we have studies that  <br>00:25:36.440 show that the more insulin resistant you  <br>00:25:38.919 are so insulin resistance is a  <br>00:25:40.559 consequence of just a lot of insulin in  <br>00:25:42.200 the body the more likely you are to be  <br>00:25:43.960 infertile and then we also know that  <br>00:25:47.279 PCOS so polycystic ovarian syndrome  <br>00:25:49.320 which is one of the leading causes of  <br>00:25:51.080 infertility in women we know that 60% of  <br>00:25:53.919 PCOS cases also are people who have  <br>00:25:57.840 insulin resistance there's a link there  <br>00:26:00.559 insulin resistance you're more likely to  <br>00:26:02.399 have PCOS and we also know that when  <br>00:26:04.799 there's a lot of insulin in a female  <br>00:26:06.520 body it tells your ovaries to produce  <br>00:26:09.840 more testosterone testosterone is the  <br>00:26:12.720 male sex hormone and if you have too  <br>00:26:14.880 much male sex hormone in the body that  <br>00:26:17.360 causes issues it can cause acne it can  <br>00:26:19.679 cause balding or hair growth on the face  <br>00:26:21.960 and it can stop your period now often  <br>00:26:24.919 when somebody has PCOS they're given the  <br>00:26:26.880 birth control pill  <br>00:26:28.760 which kind of makes sense on the surface  <br>00:26:30.480 but really doesn't solve anything what  <br>00:26:32.279 happens when you take the birth control  <br>00:26:33.480 pill is that you're just ingesting  <br>00:26:35.120 female hormones that's what the pill is  <br>00:26:37.240 it's female hormones so if you have high  <br>00:26:39.640 testosterone all of a sudden you're  <br>00:26:41.320 ingesting female hormones so the balance  <br>00:26:44.320 kind of comes back to an okay situation  <br>00:26:46.960 your symptoms of excess testosterone go  <br>00:26:50.039 away but as soon as you stop the pill  <br>00:26:53.000 the high testosterone is still there so  <br>00:26:55.320 a lot of people stop the pill trying to  <br>00:26:57.279 have a baby and they're like oh  <br>00:26:58.799 I don't have my period I have PCOS what  <br>00:27:01.919 do I do so one recommendation I have is  <br>00:27:04.559 if you have PCOS look at your glucose  <br>00:27:06.360 bikes first it's not the only reason  <br>00:27:08.480 this can happen but very often when you  <br>00:27:10.799 fix your glucose and insulin levels the  <br>00:27:12.919 symptoms of PCOS go away I was saw  <br>00:27:15.880 something on Twitter a couple of weeks  <br>00:27:16.919 ago that was trying to make the case  <br>00:27:19.159 that glucose and Insulin responses are  <br>00:27:23.760 the reason for PCOS yeah some people  <br>00:27:26.799 believe that totally you know it's a  <br>00:27:29.000 very politically charged topic some  <br>00:27:31.840 people believe you have PCOS it's  <br>00:27:34.200 genetic you can't do anything about it  <br>00:27:35.960 other people believe no no it's a  <br>00:27:37.279 metabolic disease it's a cluster of  <br>00:27:39.120 symptoms that come from high insulin I'm  <br>00:27:40.919 in that camp but you know there are some  <br>00:27:43.519 cases where somebody has PCOS and  <br>00:27:45.159 doesn't have high insulin levels so what  <br>00:27:47.480 category do they go into the thing with  <br>00:27:49.279 PCOS Stephen is that it's not a real  <br>00:27:51.720 Condition it's like a cluster of  <br>00:27:53.120 symptoms so some people could have PCOS  <br>00:27:55.559 and have cystic ovaries and balding  <br>00:27:57.840 somebody else could have PCOS and have  <br>00:27:59.840 you know missed periods and hair growth  <br>00:28:02.000 on their chin so it can take different  <br>00:28:04.559 forms so I think we're starting to  <br>00:28:06.399 understand there there variations of  <br>00:28:08.320 PCOS and some are in the insulin  <br>00:28:10.399 resistant category have you seen a woman  <br>00:28:13.120 res reverse have PCOS symptoms tons in  <br>00:28:16.039 my second book I ran a study three  <br>00:28:19.159 females who were in the program doing my  <br>00:28:21.200 hacks for just a month got their period  <br>00:28:24.200 back and were able to get pregnant in  <br>00:28:26.760 that month just with my hacks I see PCOS  <br>00:28:29.200 reversal all the  <br>00:28:31.279 time so these hacks that you you say  <br>00:28:34.039 those three women use to help reverse  <br>00:28:36.440 their their PCOS  <br>00:28:38.480 symptoms what are the hacks oh the hacks  <br>00:28:42.120 what are the ones that they did so the  <br>00:28:43.720 ones they did were Savory  <br>00:28:46.399 breakfast vinegar once a day veggie  <br>00:28:50.039 starters and moving after eating and  <br>00:28:53.360 these are four hacks that are the four  <br>00:28:56.399 most important ones of my 10 hacks that  <br>00:28:59.320 I've put together in the four-week  <br>00:29:00.760 method that second  <br>00:29:02.760 book and if you do these hacks you don't  <br>00:29:06.080 actually have to change anything else  <br>00:29:07.399 that you're eating you don't have to cut  <br>00:29:08.919 out anything you just add these in I  <br>00:29:11.200 like to see them like um little fairy  <br>00:29:13.840 godmothers that you have in your pocket  <br>00:29:15.200 and you just put throughout your day  <br>00:29:16.320 like this and you're able to reduce your  <br>00:29:17.960 glucose spikes while still eating what  <br>00:29:19.600 you love in a very low efforts kind of  <br>00:29:21.840 way and I believe these hacks should be  <br>00:29:23.880 seen like you would  <br>00:29:25.440 see brush your teeth wear sunscreen  <br>00:29:28.640 drink enough water have a Savory  <br>00:29:30.240 breakfast move after eating have a  <br>00:29:32.000 Savory breakfast so are you saying  <br>00:29:34.120 people shouldn't be eating sugar for  <br>00:29:35.399 breakfast correct so the concept of a  <br>00:29:37.600 savory breakfast comes from the simple  <br>00:29:40.080 realization that if you have a breakfast  <br>00:29:43.360 that creates a big glucose Spike you're  <br>00:29:45.720 affecting your body in many bad ways  <br>00:29:48.760 first of all you're leading to your  <br>00:29:50.480 brain not functioning too well during  <br>00:29:52.480 that day it's leading to brain fog it  <br>00:29:54.519 can make you a bit confused second it  <br>00:29:56.399 makes you tired it increases Cravings  <br>00:29:58.919 throughout the day and it also  <br>00:30:00.440 deregulates your glucose levels for the  <br>00:30:02.840 rest of the day your breakfast is very  <br>00:30:05.039 powerful if you have a glucose bike at  <br>00:30:07.120 breakfast your whole day is a glucose  <br>00:30:09.279 roller coaster so what you want to do  <br>00:30:11.080 Stephen is always have a Savory  <br>00:30:13.440 breakfast that keeps your glucose level  <br>00:30:15.080 steady a Savory breakfast is what it's  <br>00:30:17.360 based around  <br>00:30:18.600 protein eggs uh fish meat tofu nuts  <br>00:30:23.360 Dairy protein powder dinner leftovers  <br>00:30:25.640 okay protein it's really important to  <br>00:30:27.600 have protein in the morning then you add  <br>00:30:29.399 some healthy fats olive oil butter  <br>00:30:31.840 avocado and then if you want for taste  <br>00:30:34.960 you can add a bit of starch like a piece  <br>00:30:37.080 of bread for example or some potatoes  <br>00:30:39.960 importantly a Savory breakfast contains  <br>00:30:42.159 nothing sweet no cereal no muffins no  <br>00:30:44.880 orange juice no granola no fruit puree  <br>00:30:48.960 none of that it's really key sugar in my  <br>00:30:51.080 coffee no no no no if you want sugar  <br>00:30:54.720 have it as dessert after a meal after  <br>00:30:57.360 lunch or after after dinner because  <br>00:30:59.159 after your lunch and after your dinner  <br>00:31:00.760 you have lots of food already in the  <br>00:31:02.279 digestive system so any sugar you put in  <br>00:31:05.159 afterwards is going to impact your  <br>00:31:06.639 glucose levels less you said that if I  <br>00:31:09.840 have something sweet for my breakfast  <br>00:31:11.240 I'm then going to be on a glucose roller  <br>00:31:12.760 coaster yeah why because glucose Spike  <br>00:31:17.320 then insulin comes out and your glucose  <br>00:31:19.720 drop then your glucose are low here you  <br>00:31:23.360 get really hungry you have a lot of  <br>00:31:24.960 cravings when our glucose levels are  <br>00:31:26.799 dropping scientists have shown it  <br>00:31:28.600 increases the activity of the craving  <br>00:31:30.279 Center in our brain so it goes like  <br>00:31:32.519 Stephen eat some sugar and you can't  <br>00:31:35.399 control that so what you do you reach  <br>00:31:37.440 for more sugar bam another glucose Spike  <br>00:31:40.399 and then you just continue your whole  <br>00:31:42.080 day like that so you sort of put  <br>00:31:44.399 yourself into a corner if you start your  <br>00:31:46.159 day with a spike and it's really  <br>00:31:47.639 difficult to get off that roller coaster  <br>00:31:50.000 does that roller coaster last across  <br>00:31:52.960 days good question generally during the  <br>00:31:55.760 night is sort of resets and my glucose  <br>00:31:58.279 test I saw that when I go to sleep it  <br>00:31:59.760 kind of flattens out kind of goes quite  <br>00:32:01.120 low at night time  <br>00:32:03.960 however I've got this unscientific  <br>00:32:06.679 observation where if I start if I had a  <br>00:32:09.360 carrot cake now um there's a high  <br>00:32:11.880 probability that I'd probably want to  <br>00:32:13.159 have a carrot cake by dinner time  <br>00:32:14.360 tonight as well and then when I wake up  <br>00:32:16.639 the next day I probably I'm going to be  <br>00:32:19.000 more likely to go for the carrot cake  <br>00:32:20.279 again and I if I if I zoomed out on my  <br>00:32:22.720 life say the whole 12 months of a year  <br>00:32:25.880 there will be maybe like this little  <br>00:32:28.279 week or two in clusters where maybe  <br>00:32:31.200 there's a couple of months in between  <br>00:32:32.240 and then there's this two we [ __ ]  <br>00:32:33.919 Splurge again where I find it really  <br>00:32:36.080 hard not to reach for something across  <br>00:32:38.399 multiple days now I'm not sure if this  <br>00:32:40.039 is in my head I think there's a few  <br>00:32:41.760 things going on one The Taste is really  <br>00:32:43.639 addictive so you get addicted to getting  <br>00:32:45.720 that taste and getting the dopamine  <br>00:32:47.159 don't forget there's the dopamine rush  <br>00:32:48.600 in your brain second with every glucose  <br>00:32:50.960 Spike you're actually deregulating your  <br>00:32:52.559 hunger hormones so you get you have more  <br>00:32:54.919 Cravings you're hungrier and yes this  <br>00:32:56.440 can totally last for a few days and I  <br>00:32:58.440 think thirdly if you have the carrot  <br>00:32:59.840 cake at home for a few days maybe you're  <br>00:33:01.720 just more likely to reach for it because  <br>00:33:02.960 it's there you know but I feel I feel  <br>00:33:04.679 similarly to you I have these phases  <br>00:33:07.480 especially if I'm really busy and I  <br>00:33:08.679 can't do all the hacks all the time  <br>00:33:10.279 where I'm eating a bunch of sugar and  <br>00:33:12.000 then it lasts until I say okay stop back  <br>00:33:14.519 on the hacks and I do the hacks for two  <br>00:33:16.039 days and then I'm good again that's the  <br>00:33:17.960 same with me but also I find that if I  <br>00:33:19.799 do a really big workout yeah for me it  <br>00:33:22.080 helps to break that cycle so if I this  <br>00:33:24.799 weekend I did a re I was I think I was  <br>00:33:26.279 in that cycle of like I wasn't reaching  <br>00:33:28.840 for sugar as in like something sweet I  <br>00:33:30.880 was reaching for like I was having a lot  <br>00:33:32.120 of like toast with my breakfast or I was  <br>00:33:33.880 having like carbs and then I did a  <br>00:33:36.240 really big workout and the last thing I  <br>00:33:37.880 wanted was anything with carbs in or  <br>00:33:39.720 glucose I think it's also in the brain  <br>00:33:41.399 you know cuz you're rebalancing those  <br>00:33:43.840 hormones that dopamine you're getting  <br>00:33:45.399 endorphins from the workout so you're  <br>00:33:47.320 not seeking all that pleasure from just  <br>00:33:49.399 sugar okay I think if you're in a cycle  <br>00:33:51.279 where all you're just getting dopamine  <br>00:33:52.919 from sugar it just becomes addictive and  <br>00:33:54.399 you have to do stuff in your life that  <br>00:33:55.840 allows you to feel good in your brain  <br>00:33:57.279 without having that sugar so maybe I got  <br>00:33:59.399 the dopamine from the workout instead  <br>00:34:01.559 totally and so I kind of shifted yeah  <br>00:34:04.200 the source of dopamine so that was the  <br>00:34:06.080 first hack which is Theory breakfast  <br>00:34:08.719 Super Key by the way if you just do one  <br>00:34:10.918 hack do this one it is a complete  <br>00:34:13.199 GameChanger and a Savory breakfast  <br>00:34:15.440 should keep you satiated for 4 hours  <br>00:34:18.199 which is a long time most people get  <br>00:34:20.480 hungry again 2 hours after they have  <br>00:34:22.839 breakfast so make sure you're having  <br>00:34:24.599 enough protein in your breakfast to stay  <br>00:34:26.199 full for four hours  <br>00:34:28.239 okay on that what if I fast totally fine  <br>00:34:31.679 make sure the first meal of your day is  <br>00:34:33.399 also Savory so it can be at 8 a.m. it  <br>00:34:35.520 can be at 4 P.M I do not care as long as  <br>00:34:38.159 the first thing that you eat is  <br>00:34:39.520 something Savory because when you're  <br>00:34:41.280 fasted your digestive system is super  <br>00:34:43.760 empty and sensitive so whatever you give  <br>00:34:46.000 it whether it's in the morning after  <br>00:34:47.440 just sleeping or whether it's after a  <br>00:34:48.918 two week fast is going to go really  <br>00:34:50.960 quickly into your bloodstream so you  <br>00:34:52.399 have to be cautious and make sure you're  <br>00:34:54.599 not giving your body glucose otherwise  <br>00:34:57.200 big [ __ ] do you think fasting is good  <br>00:35:00.240 for you inent  <br>00:35:02.520 fasting I think it's nuanced I think  <br>00:35:05.040 what I've seen is that in men it just  <br>00:35:07.079 works way better in females it can kind  <br>00:35:10.440 of mess up your hormones you have to be  <br>00:35:12.000 a bit um judicious about when you fast  <br>00:35:15.359 and we also have to remember guys  <br>00:35:17.480 fasting is a stressor on the body it is  <br>00:35:20.440 a good stressor but it is a stressor so  <br>00:35:23.520 if you have an intense job kids to take  <br>00:35:26.680 care of you drink coffee you have you  <br>00:35:29.119 know three times a week you do hit  <br>00:35:31.200 cardio then you do a sauna then you do a  <br>00:35:33.359 cul lunch then you fast your body is  <br>00:35:35.240 going to freak the [ __ ] out you have to  <br>00:35:36.960 like dose these stressors in a way that  <br>00:35:39.920 is going to be manageable for your body  <br>00:35:41.599 I see lots of women who do all those  <br>00:35:43.560 things I just mentioned and then they're  <br>00:35:45.160 like and I don't have my perod and I  <br>00:35:46.560 don't understand I don't feel good I'm  <br>00:35:47.960 like your body is freaking out like  <br>00:35:50.560 relax you can't be putting all these  <br>00:35:52.640 stressors on yourself all the time so I  <br>00:35:55.200 fast when I'm on vacation and what kind  <br>00:35:57.839 of fasting do you do I like we'll skip a  <br>00:35:59.880 meal we'll skip dinner we'll skip  <br>00:36:01.480 breakfast and it just helps your body  <br>00:36:03.599 clean up its dead cells and it's really  <br>00:36:05.520 helpful but we have to remember that  <br>00:36:08.800 fasting is a stressor it has great  <br>00:36:10.920 benefits but you don't have to fast in  <br>00:36:13.280 order to be healthy it's very important  <br>00:36:15.240 to also look at what you're eating  <br>00:36:17.000 because if you're fasting 16 hours a day  <br>00:36:19.400 and then you're just eating junk food  <br>00:36:21.200 it's not going to be helpful to your  <br>00:36:22.480 body we have to do both in combination  <br>00:36:24.839 do you fast naturally yeah so I haven't  <br>00:36:28.440 eaten today what time are we we 1:00 um  <br>00:36:31.280 and I won't eat until you've had a  <br>00:36:33.480 coffee I've had a coffee this morning  <br>00:36:36.119 yeah but I won't eat until what 400 p.m.  <br>00:36:39.000 5:00 p.m. which will be probably you  <br>00:36:40.839 know after I get back to the office and  <br>00:36:42.400 stuff like that you feel good I feel  <br>00:36:43.880 fine so that's the thing right my  <br>00:36:45.760 recommendation is if you feel great Fab  <br>00:36:48.119 if you feel stressed out if you feel  <br>00:36:49.520 light-headed if it feels hard yeah then  <br>00:36:51.800 don't do it your body can't handle it  <br>00:36:53.000 just doesn't cross my mind to eat I  <br>00:36:54.319 don't know how people eat it's amazing  <br>00:36:56.040 yeah then go for it live your life Man  <br>00:36:58.560 live your life Stephen what about  <br>00:36:59.720 calorie restriction do you think much  <br>00:37:01.000 about that I mean it works right if you  <br>00:37:03.079 if few calories you're going to lose  <br>00:37:05.760 weight but this is one of my favorite  <br>00:37:08.079 stories do you know how calories were  <br>00:37:11.520 invented maybe okay they like put it in  <br>00:37:13.880 a box and burnt it they put yes I I told  <br>00:37:16.160 you that yes so back in the day to  <br>00:37:18.880 measure calories what do you want to  <br>00:37:20.079 measure the calorie of tell me something  <br>00:37:21.920 some my food car cake  <br>00:37:24.319 okay okay so if we were back in the day  <br>00:37:26.800 like 100 years ago and we wanted to  <br>00:37:28.040 measure the calories in your carrot cake  <br>00:37:29.680 here's what we would do we would take  <br>00:37:31.119 the carrot cake put it in a box then put  <br>00:37:33.760 this box in an aquarium filled with  <br>00:37:36.680 water so you have the aquarium and then  <br>00:37:39.520 inside you have the box with the carrot  <br>00:37:40.920 cake then we would light the carrot cake  <br>00:37:43.720 on fire inside the small box and measure  <br>00:37:47.160 by how many degrees the water in the  <br>00:37:49.520 aquarium increased in temperature so  <br>00:37:52.599 we're just measuring the heat that is  <br>00:37:56.079 created when we burn the carrot cake  <br>00:37:58.880 that is how we measure calories by how  <br>00:38:01.319 much heat is generated when you burn a  <br>00:38:03.319 food so if you were to put in that same  <br>00:38:05.480 box I don't know three avocados and you  <br>00:38:07.760 burnt them you might get the same  <br>00:38:10.000 temperature increase in the water so you  <br>00:38:11.440 might say oh this carrot cake and these  <br>00:38:12.920 three avocados have the same number of  <br>00:38:14.760 calories but the thing is with the  <br>00:38:16.280 calorie thing it's not actually telling  <br>00:38:18.119 you what's in the food it's just  <br>00:38:20.400 measuring energy that dissipated when  <br>00:38:22.839 you burnt it it's not telling you the  <br>00:38:25.079 carrot cake is going to lead to a big  <br>00:38:26.680 glucose Spike going to make you inflamed  <br>00:38:28.960 age faster release insulin whereas the  <br>00:38:31.079 three avocados will keep you steady and  <br>00:38:32.680 feeling better so two people can be  <br>00:38:35.160 eating 2,000 calories diets one person  <br>00:38:38.480 can be eating in a way that keeps their  <br>00:38:39.960 glucose nice and steady they feel good  <br>00:38:42.480 good energy F Cravings clear brain not  <br>00:38:45.599 super hungry all the time the other  <br>00:38:47.440 person can be eating just glucose  <br>00:38:49.000 spiking food and they're having a  <br>00:38:50.240 terrible time they're hungry constantly  <br>00:38:52.560 they have cravings brain fog insulin  <br>00:38:54.400 release so calories are interesting but  <br>00:38:57.160 they're not not everything we need to  <br>00:38:58.240 teach people about the molecules in  <br>00:38:59.760 their food I find that to be a much  <br>00:39:01.960 easier way to try to eat a bit less if  <br>00:39:04.000 you're trying to lose some fat is to  <br>00:39:06.160 just focus on your glucose levels  <br>00:39:07.440 because naturally your hunger hormones  <br>00:39:09.760 will rebalance you'll have few cravings  <br>00:39:11.359 and it's much easier to eat less is  <br>00:39:14.280 there a story that you've been sent or a  <br>00:39:16.240 case study from someone that's followed  <br>00:39:17.880 your work that's stuck with you someone  <br>00:39:20.040 that's understood their glucose and had  <br>00:39:21.760 a big shift in their life I imagine  <br>00:39:23.119 there's thousands but yeah there's many  <br>00:39:26.359 many I think for there's two things for  <br>00:39:28.720 me there's the the pregnancy stories  <br>00:39:30.839 because I think that's so touching  <br>00:39:31.920 because I've had many friends go through  <br>00:39:33.920 difficult fertility Journeys and to hear  <br>00:39:36.319 people who were about to embark on  <br>00:39:38.400 really intense fertility treatments and  <br>00:39:39.960 just tried this and then got pregnant I  <br>00:39:41.319 think that's really cool and then second  <br>00:39:43.400 I think it's the people  <br>00:39:45.040 whom there was this one guy he's had  <br>00:39:47.720 diabetes his whole life he's like in his  <br>00:39:49.400 50s um on lots of medication and just  <br>00:39:53.079 thought he would lose a leg and lose his  <br>00:39:55.040 vision that's what happens when you have  <br>00:39:56.240 type two for a very long time  <br>00:39:58.079 and the thing is his doctors had never  <br>00:39:59.720 explained to him why he had diabetes  <br>00:40:01.720 they had just told him you know take  <br>00:40:02.880 this pill and I take this insulin and he  <br>00:40:05.520 read my book and he understood why he  <br>00:40:07.720 got diabetes in the first place and he  <br>00:40:10.480 did the hacks he was able to reverse his  <br>00:40:12.640 type two diabetes in one year all his  <br>00:40:15.000 doctors were like how did you do it you  <br>00:40:16.960 know doctors don't often have this kind  <br>00:40:18.599 of information and then he sent me a  <br>00:40:20.520 long message saying now I'll be able to  <br>00:40:22.280 see my grandkid wedding and I really  <br>00:40:23.920 thank you for that it's so cute you know  <br>00:40:27.000 we're all we're all stuck in this  <br>00:40:29.960 vicious cycle of having this toxic food  <br>00:40:32.079 around us that's making us sick but not  <br>00:40:34.800 understanding how to get out of it and  <br>00:40:36.760 everybody wants to be healthy that man  <br>00:40:39.359 he was eating stuff that he thought  <br>00:40:41.119 would be good for him he was eating like  <br>00:40:43.119 the low calorie rice cakes and the fruit  <br>00:40:46.079 smoothies and the lowfat yogurts and all  <br>00:40:48.599 these things trying to be healthier but  <br>00:40:51.280 if you don't have the right information  <br>00:40:52.680 you can't actually make a change what  <br>00:40:55.640 would you say to parents it's it's  <br>00:40:57.680 really interesting cuz I I've had the  <br>00:40:59.520 experience of watching a lot of early  <br>00:41:01.000 parents over the last couple of months  <br>00:41:02.680 and um they care so much about their  <br>00:41:06.240 kids just eating it something that often  <br>00:41:08.839 they'll give them something that is high  <br>00:41:10.319 in glucose does it matter you know  <br>00:41:13.200 because sometimes people look at kids  <br>00:41:14.240 and go well they're a kid they they'll  <br>00:41:16.000 kind of it won't have an impact on them  <br>00:41:18.160 they'll kind of grow out of it yeah well  <br>00:41:20.240 we'll make sure that they eat healthy  <br>00:41:21.400 later we just need to make sure they eat  <br>00:41:22.839 something now listen we used to think  <br>00:41:25.520 type two diabetes was a disease is  <br>00:41:27.480 reserved for adults and now 5-year-olds  <br>00:41:29.240 get it it's very important to help your  <br>00:41:31.560 kids eat well so that they set up their  <br>00:41:33.720 body in a healthy way one thing that I  <br>00:41:35.640 hear is yeah Jesse I know I should be  <br>00:41:37.400 giving my kids eggs in the morning but  <br>00:41:40.040 they just keep begging for the cereal  <br>00:41:41.640 and I just I can't say no you know they  <br>00:41:43.760 they won't they won't let go I have to  <br>00:41:45.760 give it to them and I say what if they  <br>00:41:47.640 were begging you for  <br>00:41:49.280 cigarettes would you give them the  <br>00:41:51.359 cigarettes like you don't actually have  <br>00:41:53.800 to give your kids this food it's hard  <br>00:41:56.960 for for sure but if it's a priority for  <br>00:41:59.319 you you can totally do it absolutely and  <br>00:42:01.960 I think it's important to set an example  <br>00:42:04.839 actually because if you're having cereal  <br>00:42:06.440 and orange juice it's going to be really  <br>00:42:07.720 hard for your kids to take you seriously  <br>00:42:09.400 like come on dad like you know shut up  <br>00:42:12.200 what you think of giving kids orange  <br>00:42:13.440 juice oh my God it's terrible it's the  <br>00:42:15.240 worst it's it's it's just terrible it's  <br>00:42:17.960 big rush of sugar can affect it can  <br>00:42:20.319 affect Behavior you know tantrums and  <br>00:42:23.160 the sugar cravings and the sugar lows I  <br>00:42:26.400 mean no it's terrible it breaks my heart  <br>00:42:28.880 I'm like wow those little bodies are not  <br>00:42:31.200 happy right now you know there's so many  <br>00:42:33.920 parents that are listening right now  <br>00:42:35.800 like you don't [ __ ] get it you too  <br>00:42:38.400 childless better totally and that's why  <br>00:42:40.599 Stephen you know when I have kids I  <br>00:42:42.280 totally want to write a book about that  <br>00:42:43.559 because I think there's lots of stuff we  <br>00:42:44.559 can teach a parents about how to feed  <br>00:42:47.040 their kids it's too easy for me to say  <br>00:42:49.079 this stuff I don't have kids I don't  <br>00:42:50.119 know how it is but I can tell you one  <br>00:42:51.559 thing there will be no orange juice in  <br>00:42:53.960 my house no orange juice like my mom my  <br>00:42:57.319 mom was addicted to diet coke when she  <br>00:42:58.839 was younger so we never had soda in our  <br>00:43:00.680 house never and I hate I hate soda now I  <br>00:43:03.359 would never be able to drink any of that  <br>00:43:05.240 stuff because it was never I never  <br>00:43:06.839 learned to like it so don't be scared  <br>00:43:09.040 that your kid is going to binge if you  <br>00:43:11.040 restrict all the sugary stuff I think  <br>00:43:12.559 it's the opposite I think if you don't  <br>00:43:13.920 give them the Habit they just won't have  <br>00:43:15.240 the habit I do agree we we um we didn't  <br>00:43:17.880 have many sweet things or fizzy drinks  <br>00:43:20.960 or anything in in the house and I think  <br>00:43:22.400 as a kid I was resentful because you  <br>00:43:24.359 you'd go to school and you'd see those  <br>00:43:25.640 things you you'd lean towards them and  <br>00:43:27.319 you'd love them at school but frankly as  <br>00:43:29.079 I've grown older I'm completely cool  <br>00:43:30.920 with just drinking water all the time  <br>00:43:33.200 that's part partly because that's what  <br>00:43:34.480 we had in the house so my relationship  <br>00:43:36.160 with water is pretty strong I feel you  <br>00:43:38.280 but you know one thing that parents do  <br>00:43:39.599 tell me is that when they do their  <br>00:43:40.680 glucose hacks and they manage their  <br>00:43:42.280 glucose levels they're able to be more  <br>00:43:43.960 Zen around their kids and sort of you  <br>00:43:46.079 know stay a bit more um centered when  <br>00:43:49.040 their kids are freaking out or asking  <br>00:43:50.520 about something a lot their their mood  <br>00:43:52.400 is steadier so they can actually make  <br>00:43:53.920 better choices for the whole family and  <br>00:43:55.280 they have a bit more stamina and uh then  <br>00:43:57.960 their kids do the hacks and their kids  <br>00:44:01.079 get calmer and then the family is just  <br>00:44:02.880 having a better time generally but it  <br>00:44:05.079 can really  <br>00:44:06.319 impact even a marriage this a great  <br>00:44:08.520 study I have to tell you about that was  <br>00:44:10.680 looking at married couples so they  <br>00:44:12.559 recruited 300 married couples and bless  <br>00:44:15.160 these scientists they're just insane so  <br>00:44:17.400 they recruited 300 married couples they  <br>00:44:20.000 gave each person in the marriage a  <br>00:44:22.640 voodoo doll representing their spouse so  <br>00:44:26.680 if you're in a marriage you have a  <br>00:44:27.880 voodoo doll representing your husband or  <br>00:44:29.400 your wife scientists then asked the  <br>00:44:32.400 people to put a pin in the voodo doll  <br>00:44:36.440 representing their spouse every time  <br>00:44:38.319 their spouse annoyed them for six weeks  <br>00:44:42.400 at the end of the study they took all  <br>00:44:43.839 the voodoo dolls counted the pins they  <br>00:44:45.839 also measured the participants glucose  <br>00:44:48.520 levels what they found Stephen is that  <br>00:44:51.960 those who had more variable glucose  <br>00:44:54.400 levels specifically those who had more  <br>00:44:56.160 low glucose level events which happens  <br>00:44:58.440 after spikes had put more pins in the  <br>00:45:02.520 voodoo doll representing their spouse so  <br>00:45:05.359 their glucose levels seem to be linked  <br>00:45:07.240 to how irritated they were with their  <br>00:45:09.079 partner and then the scientists  <br>00:45:10.880 speculated that this had to do with a  <br>00:45:13.000 neurotransmitter called tyrosine and the  <br>00:45:15.280 more glucose roller coaster you have  <br>00:45:17.119 going on the lower your tyrosine levels  <br>00:45:19.440 and tyrosine balances our mood so the  <br>00:45:22.599 food you eat can impact your marriage  <br>00:45:25.480 can impact how you show up  <br>00:45:27.640 with others can impact how you feel  <br>00:45:30.160 about other people's behavior it goes  <br>00:45:32.079 really deep it's not just about diabetes  <br>00:45:34.559 it it impacts who you are as a person  <br>00:45:36.559 your personality so if I stop eating  <br>00:45:38.680 sugar it will save my marriage I mean  <br>00:45:41.200 you said  <br>00:45:43.079 it it's not it's really interesting I  <br>00:45:45.040 was thinking as you were talking as well  <br>00:45:46.240 about how glucose is linked to our sort  <br>00:45:51.240 of discipline more broadly you know you  <br>00:45:53.839 were talking earlier about parents and  <br>00:45:55.559 them being able to be more sort of  <br>00:45:56.599 disciplined and strict with and calm  <br>00:46:00.119 when they themselves get their glucose  <br>00:46:02.000 under control but you think about all of  <br>00:46:03.359 our lives our lives are shaped by the  <br>00:46:04.760 habits that we perform consistently and  <br>00:46:06.680 for us to have good um habits that are  <br>00:46:10.000 prod conducive with our health our  <br>00:46:12.480 happiness our success then we need to be  <br>00:46:15.240 focused and disciplined and be able to  <br>00:46:17.000 reach for the right things um whether  <br>00:46:19.240 it's a dumbbell or whether it's our  <br>00:46:21.160 laptop yeah so like do do you ever think  <br>00:46:23.599 much about the role that glucose plays  <br>00:46:25.200 with our sort of discipline to be who we  <br>00:46:27.079 want to be to sh up how we want to sh up  <br>00:46:28.680 completely because so many people are  <br>00:46:30.520 stuck in a cycle of being a victim to  <br>00:46:33.079 their Cravings being a victim to their  <br>00:46:34.599 fatigue and they can't show up as the  <br>00:46:36.440 person they want to be and if you switch  <br>00:46:39.599 your diet and use these hacks you can  <br>00:46:42.079 actually be more connected to the  <br>00:46:44.079 version of yourself that you want to be  <br>00:46:45.920 and even just a simple thing like a  <br>00:46:47.200 Savory breakfast it can deeply change  <br>00:46:49.960 how you show up throughout your day  <br>00:46:52.280 instead of being exhausted at 11:00 a.m.  <br>00:46:55.160 needing four coffees feeling this  <br>00:46:56.920 lethargic in your work meeting then at 3  <br>00:46:59.040 p.m. thinking oh I really want to have a  <br>00:47:00.640 nap I would have a nap on the floor  <br>00:47:02.000 right here if I could looking for sugar  <br>00:47:03.839 all the time you actually have a clearer  <br>00:47:05.680 brain like we know glucose spikes are  <br>00:47:07.440 linked to even just brain fog and brain  <br>00:47:09.680 fog is a debilitating symptom to have  <br>00:47:12.440 you can't show up as the person you want  <br>00:47:14.559 to be I would never be able to do the  <br>00:47:16.160 work that I do if I didn't have my  <br>00:47:17.960 glucose under control and I learned that  <br>00:47:19.800 from the very beginning that's why I got  <br>00:47:21.119 into this work in the first place but  <br>00:47:23.200 100% agree with you yeah so the first  <br>00:47:25.839 hack we talked about was the Savory  <br>00:47:27.839 breakfast there was the second one you  <br>00:47:29.040 talked about vinegar which we talked  <br>00:47:30.280 about last time which I remember I was  <br>00:47:31.440 really repulsed by but you count this as  <br>00:47:33.680 one of your most important hacks is to  <br>00:47:36.319 eat vinegar every day it's drink one  <br>00:47:38.480 tablespoon of vinegar in a big glass of  <br>00:47:40.319 water before your biggest meal of the  <br>00:47:42.440 day and the reason it's important  <br>00:47:43.599 Stephen is because it's easy and I'm all  <br>00:47:45.960 about easy hacks big bang for your bck  <br>00:47:48.720 so vinegar contains acetic acid which  <br>00:47:51.640 interacts with your digestive enzymes  <br>00:47:53.680 and cuts the glucose Spike of your meal  <br>00:47:55.440 by up to 30% with no effort so if you  <br>00:47:58.280 want a super low effort albeit not very  <br>00:48:01.040 delicious super low effort hack to try  <br>00:48:03.800 do that and see how you feel with a  <br>00:48:06.480 smaller Spike and a smaller crash few  <br>00:48:08.559 Cravings less fatigue what kind of  <br>00:48:10.440 vinegar any kind of vinegar it can be  <br>00:48:12.680 the vinegar you have at home literally  <br>00:48:14.079 tonight just grab the white vinegar in  <br>00:48:16.319 your kitchen and not the cleaning  <br>00:48:17.640 vinegar if it's next to the toilet paper  <br>00:48:19.079 it's not the right vinegar you want the  <br>00:48:20.800 kitchen vinegar one tablespoon in a big  <br>00:48:23.079 glass of water dilute it drink it 10  <br>00:48:25.079 minutes before having your dinner see  <br>00:48:26.440 how you feel what's what role is the  <br>00:48:28.079 water playing in this just dilution so  <br>00:48:30.520 that it doesn't hurt your teeth because  <br>00:48:32.280 your dentist won't be very happy if you  <br>00:48:34.240 take a shot of vinegar because it can  <br>00:48:35.520 hurt your teeth's enamel okay so that's  <br>00:48:38.240 hack number two and that's really to  <br>00:48:39.640 sort of line my stomach to so no that's  <br>00:48:42.800 to interact with your digestive enzymes  <br>00:48:44.960 the line stomach is the third hack which  <br>00:48:46.960 is Veggie starters so all around the  <br>00:48:49.640 world if you look at different cultures  <br>00:48:51.160 you see this habit this tradition of  <br>00:48:53.440 starting your meal with veggies in Italy  <br>00:48:56.160 aunti  <br>00:48:57.359 in France crud raw vegetables at the end  <br>00:49:00.359 of your at the beginning of your meal in  <br>00:49:02.200 the Middle East you start your meals  <br>00:49:04.119 with herbs by the bunch right why are we  <br>00:49:07.319 doing this veggies first thing well  <br>00:49:09.559 recently scientists have discovered why  <br>00:49:11.040 it's so powerful it's because veggies  <br>00:49:13.520 contain fiber we love fiber she's the  <br>00:49:16.760 best when you have fiber at the  <br>00:49:18.480 beginning of a meal what it does is that  <br>00:49:20.359 it coats your intestine it makes this  <br>00:49:22.440 sort of protective barrier this  <br>00:49:24.960 protective mesh kind of goo fibrous mesh  <br>00:49:28.720 and so any glucose you eat afterwards  <br>00:49:31.400 will not be able to go through your  <br>00:49:33.839 intestine into your bloodstream so  <br>00:49:35.680 quickly so it slows down the arrival of  <br>00:49:38.040 glucose into your blood and it slows  <br>00:49:40.079 down that Spike you can make the  <br>00:49:42.119 experiment if you're wearing a monitor  <br>00:49:44.359 just have a a small plate of you know  <br>00:49:47.240 carrots or spinach or broccoli or cherry  <br>00:49:49.280 tomatoes or whatever veggie you like  <br>00:49:51.160 before a meal and see how much smaller  <br>00:49:53.000 your glucose spike is you stay Fuller  <br>00:49:55.359 for longer have few crat and you're  <br>00:49:57.200 helping your body from within too and  <br>00:49:59.559 the fourth one you mentioned was moving  <br>00:50:01.440 after after eating yeah so after eating  <br>00:50:05.240 use your body and your muscles for 10  <br>00:50:07.200 minutes you can clean your apartment go  <br>00:50:10.319 for a walk with your dog dance to a few  <br>00:50:12.680 songs if you're at the office you can do  <br>00:50:15.240 calf raises under your desk like this so  <br>00:50:17.200 you just sort of push up onto the balls  <br>00:50:18.920 of your feet up and down for 10 minutes  <br>00:50:20.960 nobody will see and your calves contain  <br>00:50:23.559 a muscle called the Solus muscle which  <br>00:50:25.240 is really good at soaking up glucose but  <br>00:50:27.559 it's what we were talking about earlier  <br>00:50:28.839 Stephen your muscles are really  <br>00:50:31.000 effective glucose dumps and the more you  <br>00:50:33.119 use them to contract the more they're  <br>00:50:34.920 going to soak up glucose from your  <br>00:50:36.520 bloodstream to use for energy so that's  <br>00:50:39.400 the four hacks Savory breakfast vinegar  <br>00:50:42.119 once a day veggie starter once a day you  <br>00:50:44.319 can also combine those two and do like a  <br>00:50:46.599 vinegar dressing on a veggie starter and  <br>00:50:49.319 then moving after eating and then when  <br>00:50:51.200 you want to get Pro you go to all my  <br>00:50:52.480 other hacks people talk about being in a  <br>00:50:54.240 food comr after they've eaten yeah which  <br>00:50:56.640 which is I mean the antithesis of what  <br>00:50:58.040 you're you're saying absolutely food  <br>00:51:00.520 coma is like a combination of brain fog  <br>00:51:02.119 and fatigue right and what's going on  <br>00:51:04.200 there well I think there's a lot of  <br>00:51:06.000 things going on but one study that's  <br>00:51:07.520 really interesting shows us that in rats  <br>00:51:10.839 when you create lots of big glucose  <br>00:51:12.839 spikes and when you monitor the activity  <br>00:51:15.040 of their neurons in the rats scientists  <br>00:51:17.480 noticed that the more glucose spikes  <br>00:51:19.400 they had the slower the speed of the  <br>00:51:23.440 signal between their neurons so their  <br>00:51:25.799 brain was literally slowing down the  <br>00:51:28.960 information was going more slowly  <br>00:51:31.000 throughout the brain and they're the  <br>00:51:32.400 they theorized that in humans this could  <br>00:51:34.440 lead to brain fog so you have glucose  <br>00:51:36.799 spikes linked to brain fog and your  <br>00:51:39.079 mitochondria becoming exhausted from Big  <br>00:51:41.720 glucose spikes potentially making you  <br>00:51:43.839 really tired you know 90 minutes after  <br>00:51:45.640 eating with the hack food coma reduced  <br>00:51:49.079 significantly so you can actually do  <br>00:51:50.839 stuff after eating instead of just being  <br>00:51:53.119 lying down and not being able to get up  <br>00:51:55.960 and you took these hacks and you did an  <br>00:51:57.920 experiment right on page seven of your  <br>00:52:00.640 book the glucose goddess  <br>00:52:03.440 method you talk about this 2,700 person  <br>00:52:07.040 pilot experiment that you did in 2019  <br>00:52:10.599 yeah which of the hacks did you use for  <br>00:52:13.000 this experiment and what did you find so  <br>00:52:15.040 it was these four hacks so it was a  <br>00:52:16.720 four-week experiment week one you start  <br>00:52:19.480 your Savory breakfast every day you do  <br>00:52:21.559 that for the four weeks week two you add  <br>00:52:24.160 in vinegar once a day you continue for  <br>00:52:26.520 for the rest of the three weeks week  <br>00:52:28.240 three you add veggie starters and week  <br>00:52:30.079 four you add moving after eating you  <br>00:52:33.040 don't have to change anything else about  <br>00:52:34.799 what you're eating I'm not cutting out  <br>00:52:36.599 sugar I'm not telling you to not drink  <br>00:52:38.280 alcohol I'm not telling you to not drink  <br>00:52:39.559 pasta I'm just asking you to add these  <br>00:52:42.200 for hacks in and see what happens and  <br>00:52:45.440 these people were from 110 countries  <br>00:52:47.559 yeah I recruited I recruited them online  <br>00:52:49.760 on through Instagram between the ages of  <br>00:52:51.799 20 and 70 years old mhm and what  <br>00:52:55.160 happened listen the results were really  <br>00:52:57.520 stunning so 90% of people reduced their  <br>00:52:59.799 Cravings 90% of people had more energy  <br>00:53:02.160 you had really significant impacts on  <br>00:53:04.040 sleep on hormones on skin on mood on  <br>00:53:08.400 Diabetes I mean of course this is not a  <br>00:53:11.119 you know Placebo controlled randomized  <br>00:53:13.200 trial it's just an experiment I didn't  <br>00:53:15.079 have a control group but these numbers  <br>00:53:17.400 are pretty remarkable and that's what I  <br>00:53:19.359 see when I meet people when I see the  <br>00:53:21.400 testimonials from my readers so just  <br>00:53:23.520 very quick impact because glucose spikes  <br>00:53:26.240 imp act all parts of our system physical  <br>00:53:29.799 and mental and when you balance them  <br>00:53:31.400 Stephen you're creating a much better  <br>00:53:33.559 foundation for your body and your mind  <br>00:53:36.079 to be healthy and these are  <br>00:53:37.640 self-reported symptoms right totally  <br>00:53:39.240 yeah so we did a survey at the end of  <br>00:53:41.240 every of the four weeks and uh just  <br>00:53:43.599 measured the results and when you say  <br>00:53:46.200 there's no control group that means that  <br>00:53:48.440 there wasn't another group who weren't  <br>00:53:50.960 who were doing like a different kind of  <br>00:53:52.760 intervention or Placebo no okay so it  <br>00:53:54.960 was just 3,000 people doing the hacks  <br>00:53:57.240 and I was just asking them questions uh  <br>00:53:59.680 at the end and it says here 40% roughly  <br>00:54:02.000 40% of people who wanted to lose weight  <br>00:54:03.680 did in fact lose weight in those four  <br>00:54:05.040 weeks yeah with no calorie restriction  <br>00:54:07.680 no request to eat less and the reason  <br>00:54:11.400 this is interesting is that even though  <br>00:54:13.200 weight loss is not the primary objective  <br>00:54:15.359 of balancing your glucose levels what  <br>00:54:17.400 happens when you reduce your spikes is  <br>00:54:19.799 that you reduce Cravings because you're  <br>00:54:21.760 not activating that craving Center  <br>00:54:23.319 anymore you reduce hunger you have more  <br>00:54:25.799 energy to potentially move more and you  <br>00:54:28.839 lower your insulin levels now this is  <br>00:54:30.920 very important because when there's  <br>00:54:32.480 insulin present in your body you cannot  <br>00:54:34.799 burn fat insulin is storing fat and  <br>00:54:38.240 making more fat and when you lower  <br>00:54:40.520 insulin you can actually burn some of  <br>00:54:42.760 the fat that you stored and there's  <br>00:54:44.799 going to be people screaming because  <br>00:54:45.799 they want to know the other sort of six  <br>00:54:47.680 this 10 right yeah I can go through all  <br>00:54:49.400 of them if you want sit the other six AR  <br>00:54:51.839 of course of course of course so another  <br>00:54:54.359 hack is eating your food in the right  <br>00:54:56.799 now this is kind of similar to the  <br>00:54:58.440 veggie starter it's just a bit more  <br>00:55:00.280 complicated and it's really where the  <br>00:55:02.119 science it's really what the science  <br>00:55:03.960 shows us the science shows us that if  <br>00:55:06.400 you eat a meal in the right order  <br>00:55:08.280 meaning veggies first then proteins and  <br>00:55:11.559 fats then starches and sugars instead of  <br>00:55:14.480 the opposite you reduce the glucose  <br>00:55:16.400 Spike of the meal by up to  <br>00:55:18.559 75% you're eating the same meal the same  <br>00:55:22.440 quantity the same food just the order  <br>00:55:24.480 and using that fiber first mentality  <br>00:55:26.920 is going to reduce your Spike  <br>00:55:28.559 significantly just to be clear this  <br>00:55:29.680 doesn't mean that I'm going to gain less  <br>00:55:31.799 weight from that  <br>00:55:33.520 meal well no because it doesn't H you  <br>00:55:36.039 know weight loss doesn't happen within  <br>00:55:37.559 one specific meal but it does mean  <br>00:55:39.359 you'll have fewer Cravings a couple  <br>00:55:41.079 hours after that meal so maybe you won't  <br>00:55:42.680 reach for the donut okay that's how it  <br>00:55:44.680 would work so indirectly I might not  <br>00:55:46.520 game more away exactly exactly so eating  <br>00:55:49.520 your food in the right order okay having  <br>00:55:51.880 a Savory breakfast we talked about it  <br>00:55:54.000 veggies first we talked about it vinegar  <br>00:55:56.520 we talked about it moving after eating  <br>00:55:57.799 we talked about it and then there's  <br>00:55:58.920 clothes on  <br>00:56:00.119 carbs so that means anytime you eat  <br>00:56:03.119 starches or sugars which are the big  <br>00:56:05.280 category of carbs make sure you're never  <br>00:56:07.280 eating them naked or on their own  <br>00:56:10.960 because if you eat them on their own  <br>00:56:13.400 plof they just turn into glucose really  <br>00:56:15.200 really quickly so instead of having a  <br>00:56:16.480 slice of bread on its own have bread and  <br>00:56:19.039 some avocado add some fat to that that's  <br>00:56:21.640 a good clothing to add or add some  <br>00:56:23.440 protein or add some Fiber if you're  <br>00:56:25.119 having a carrot cake don't have it on  <br>00:56:27.280 its own have it with a Greek yogurt for  <br>00:56:29.480 example so that's clothes on carbs it's  <br>00:56:33.839 really easy to remember especially if  <br>00:56:36.599 you're going throughout your day and you  <br>00:56:37.839 can't really pick what you're eating  <br>00:56:39.440 because you don't have many options just  <br>00:56:40.760 think clothes on carbs then we have  <br>00:56:43.119 Savory  <br>00:56:44.240 snacks so during a day if you want to  <br>00:56:46.920 have a snack between meals when your  <br>00:56:49.039 stomach is empty try to have something  <br>00:56:51.280 Savory that won't increase your glucose  <br>00:56:53.440 spikes instead of having something sweet  <br>00:56:56.760 then another hack that we kind of  <br>00:56:57.920 touched on is if you want to eat  <br>00:57:00.119 something sweet have it as dessert  <br>00:57:02.400 instead of on an empty stomach so if I  <br>00:57:04.359 want a cookie or a carrot cake I will  <br>00:57:06.319 make sure to buy it in the morning if I  <br>00:57:07.880 know where I want to get it from and  <br>00:57:08.960 then have it as dessert after my lunch  <br>00:57:10.839 or after my dinner so I'm not removing  <br>00:57:13.880 any of the sugar from your life I'm just  <br>00:57:15.960 showing you how and when to eat it so it  <br>00:57:18.720 will reduce the glucose Spike and then  <br>00:57:21.000 we have always eat your fruit whole  <br>00:57:23.720 never Juiced never dried never smoothed  <br>00:57:26.920 only whole to have that protective fiber  <br>00:57:29.200 in there thinking about your Instagram  <br>00:57:32.079 you post these photos of glucose spikes  <br>00:57:33.920 with um in response to different foods  <br>00:57:35.920 how do you trial that is that oh great  <br>00:57:38.319 question are those your spikes yeah  <br>00:57:40.039 those are my spikes or the spikes from  <br>00:57:41.480 somebody on my team but it's really  <br>00:57:42.799 important to note that these spikes are  <br>00:57:46.119 just  <br>00:57:46.920 illustrating studies trials that have  <br>00:57:49.520 been done by scientists around the world  <br>00:57:51.000 so for example I'll find a clinical  <br>00:57:52.960 trial showing that vinegar before a meal  <br>00:57:55.079 reduces a glucose Spike it's been shown  <br>00:57:57.039 at scale with a placebo you know proper  <br>00:57:59.799 clinical study and I'll just make an  <br>00:58:02.000 example with my own data to illustrate  <br>00:58:04.799 that scientific study and that's why if  <br>00:58:06.599 you swipe on my post you'll see my graph  <br>00:58:08.799 and then the study that I mentioned or  <br>00:58:10.200 in the description of the post I don't  <br>00:58:12.280 draw any conclusions from my own glucose  <br>00:58:14.400 data I'm not like oh look today I had a  <br>00:58:16.880 green tea and that didn't cause a spike  <br>00:58:18.359 and yesterday I had a green tea and I  <br>00:58:19.760 also had a piece of I don't know  <br>00:58:21.119 whatever an almond and that caused a  <br>00:58:23.160 biggest [ __ ] so I should be telling  <br>00:58:25.160 everybody to not have elments like  <br>00:58:26.640 that's not how it works at all it's just  <br>00:58:28.720 an illustration of existing studies  <br>00:58:30.960 that's my role that's my job that's what  <br>00:58:32.319 I love to do to translate studies that  <br>00:58:34.440 are existing in a way that makes it  <br>00:58:37.440 easier for people to understand because  <br>00:58:39.240 you can't just give somebody a  <br>00:58:41.400 scientific paper you have to explain it  <br>00:58:44.039 in a visual way that they can  <br>00:58:45.839 immediately get it so of those visuals  <br>00:58:49.200 that you've made is there some in  <br>00:58:52.280 particular that were most surprising to  <br>00:58:53.920 you or most shocking to you because I'm  <br>00:58:55.200 going to put some of them on the screen  <br>00:58:56.720 so some of them that come to mind that  <br>00:58:58.280 would maybe had the biggest response  <br>00:59:01.000 from your audience for example yeah I  <br>00:59:03.480 think some of the ones that show  <br>00:59:04.960 traditional food combinations and how  <br>00:59:06.559 they're actually good for our glucose  <br>00:59:07.760 levels are fascinating for example  <br>00:59:09.720 grapes and cheese so I'm French and  <br>00:59:12.400 often when you eat like a big uh plateau  <br>00:59:15.119 of cheese you'll have some grapes there  <br>00:59:16.559 to have with and it you know the glucose  <br>00:59:19.039 response shows us that if we had the  <br>00:59:20.359 grape on its own it would be a bigger  <br>00:59:22.280 Spike than the grape with the cheese not  <br>00:59:24.319 only is it really delicious it's Al  <br>00:59:26.280 better for your glucose levels because  <br>00:59:27.480 you're putting clothing on that sugary  <br>00:59:29.799 carb that is the piece of fruit or ham  <br>00:59:33.880 and melon or rice and beans all these  <br>00:59:37.359 traditional combinations cause smaller  <br>00:59:40.039 spikes than you would expect from the  <br>00:59:41.799 individual ingredients that's really  <br>00:59:43.920 quite fascinating in terms of the most  <br>00:59:46.400 um shocking ones I think  <br>00:59:48.760 any glucose graph showing food order is  <br>00:59:52.559 really interesting so for example if you  <br>00:59:54.280 have salad and then then pasta which is  <br>00:59:57.640 much better for your glucose levels than  <br>00:59:59.359 having pasta and then the salad  <br>01:00:01.880 interesting yeah and that's the food  <br>01:00:03.240 order hack going on do you know off the  <br>01:00:06.440 top of your head what your most engaged  <br>01:00:08.960 post has been of all time the one that's  <br>01:00:10.920 been shared the most or commented on the  <br>01:00:12.359 most um actually it's one currently at  <br>01:00:15.640 least on YouTube it's one where I  <br>01:00:17.280 explain where I show an image of an  <br>01:00:19.440 ancestral banana what bananas used to  <br>01:00:21.960 actually look like in nature and what  <br>01:00:24.319 bananas look like today to illustrate  <br>01:00:26.000 that the fruit that you find today in  <br>01:00:27.160 the supermarket is not natural so that's  <br>01:00:30.160 a very very popular one and then I think  <br>01:00:32.280 it's the hacks um it's the glucose  <br>01:00:34.960 graphs and the videos where I explain  <br>01:00:36.280 food order people really love that it's  <br>01:00:38.480 so interesting to see that if you have  <br>01:00:41.839 your veggies at the beginning of a meal  <br>01:00:43.559 you have such a big impact on your  <br>01:00:45.520 glucose levels whereas we've all been  <br>01:00:47.160 taught that all your food mixes in your  <br>01:00:49.319 stomach and mixes like big smoothie and  <br>01:00:51.039 it doesn't matter well it does  <br>01:00:53.359 actually yeah that because that's really  <br>01:00:56.000 easy to change as well totally you don't  <br>01:00:57.799 have to change what you're eating how  <br>01:00:59.799 much you're eating just next time you're  <br>01:01:02.000 sat at a meal think oh I'm going to have  <br>01:01:04.280 the veggies on my plate first that's it  <br>01:01:07.559 so powerful these hacks are so easy  <br>01:01:10.640 Stephen I really want everybody to know  <br>01:01:12.160 them I want to become irrelevant I don't  <br>01:01:13.880 want to have any more work because  <br>01:01:15.359 everybody knows these hacks it's so  <br>01:01:17.200 important for our Public Health I think  <br>01:01:19.599 some uh vinegar has arrived for you to  <br>01:01:21.280 shot yeah no we can't shot it Stephen we  <br>01:01:23.559 have to dilute it I'm I'll dilute it as  <br>01:01:25.599 well let  <br>01:01:28.680 for yes so this is side of vinegar but  <br>01:01:32.160 any vinegar works you don't have to buy  <br>01:01:33.680 expensive vinegar it doesn't have to be  <br>01:01:35.240 organic unfiltered whatever just kitchen  <br>01:01:37.359 vinegar works no I try it straight I've  <br>01:01:40.119 actually never really drink okay but if  <br>01:01:41.599 you're dentist is upset it's not my  <br>01:01:42.839 fault okay  <br>01:01:45.920 well so Jesse told me to drink this  <br>01:01:48.839 straight no she's an expert she said  <br>01:01:51.200 she's a scientist  <br>01:01:57.599 oh  <br>01:01:59.880 gosh yeah you're not supposed to do that  <br>01:02:01.960 Stephen no I'm  <br>01:02:03.359 sorry no it's been really lovely getting  <br>01:02:05.599 to imagine if but it's not that bad but  <br>01:02:09.520 it's not something that I would do for  <br>01:02:11.079 fun yeah but also if you want to have  <br>01:02:12.760 vinegar straight you need to get higher  <br>01:02:14.160 quality vinegar there's some vinegars  <br>01:02:15.640 that taste really really good but in our  <br>01:02:17.799 case we're just trying to get the acetic  <br>01:02:19.559 acid and we don't need high quality  <br>01:02:21.039 expensive vinegar we can just do like  <br>01:02:22.400 really cheap  <br>01:02:23.359 vinegar and this is a we just put one  <br>01:02:25.480 tbspoon this is a good hack if you have  <br>01:02:27.240 a parent that has diabetes and they  <br>01:02:29.200 don't want to change anything about  <br>01:02:30.319 their lifestyle just get them to add  <br>01:02:32.160 this before their meals when they're  <br>01:02:33.160 eating carbs and you'll see a good  <br>01:02:34.319 impact on their glucos levels okay so  <br>01:02:36.119 I'm mixing it like this you didn't put  <br>01:02:37.880 much in there I put a tablespoon it's a  <br>01:02:41.839 tablespoon and even that small amount  <br>01:02:44.119 you L it looked like you you kind of  <br>01:02:45.520 filled the lid I fill the lid twice  <br>01:02:47.279 basically which is approximately one  <br>01:02:49.400 tablespoon I think cuz this is probably  <br>01:02:51.880 like yeah this is half a tablespoon I  <br>01:02:54.920 would say okay I've done this  <br>01:02:56.799 before and now you can't taste  <br>01:03:01.119 anything you're telling me that that  <br>01:03:03.039 will have an impact absolutely and the  <br>01:03:04.520 studies prove it I can't taste anything  <br>01:03:06.799 yeah maybe because I just had the big  <br>01:03:08.160 shot I think that's probably why but but  <br>01:03:11.400 totally Stephen I even meet people on  <br>01:03:13.520 the street or like my readers and stuff  <br>01:03:15.079 and they'll show me that in their purse  <br>01:03:16.440 they have a little um bottle of vinegar  <br>01:03:18.640 they take with them it's super easy and  <br>01:03:21.000 you know I was very skeptical and I  <br>01:03:22.279 think everybody was super skeptical  <br>01:03:23.680 about the vinegar thing until the  <br>01:03:25.799 studies were widely read it's it's an  <br>01:03:28.680 amazing ingredient that's been used for  <br>01:03:31.079 Millennia for its health benefits but  <br>01:03:33.279 now we understand how it works it has  <br>01:03:35.119 impact on visceral fat on cholesterol  <br>01:03:37.359 levels on glucose and on insulin levels  <br>01:03:39.319 it's a magical ingredient it's super  <br>01:03:41.039 cheap so have some vinegar but be very  <br>01:03:43.640 careful now a lot of big brands are  <br>01:03:45.559 jumping on this and are making vinegar  <br>01:03:47.039 drinks that have sugar in them so you  <br>01:03:48.960 want straight vinegar you don't want  <br>01:03:50.319 anything that has even a tiny bit of  <br>01:03:51.920 apple juice or sugar uhuhuh straight  <br>01:03:54.359 vinegar  <br>01:03:56.319 you said visceral fat yeah is that belly  <br>01:03:58.319 fat yeah it's the fat between your  <br>01:04:00.000 organs it's the fat that's really bad  <br>01:04:02.079 for you so you can have fat that is sort  <br>01:04:04.680 of on the outside of your body and you  <br>01:04:06.160 can you can grab it you know you can  <br>01:04:08.319 grab it and you can really pinch it  <br>01:04:09.920 speak for yourself no I totally have  <br>01:04:12.160 nice fat here that I can grab yeah yeah  <br>01:04:14.279 so this fat you know I can grab visceral  <br>01:04:17.160 fat is underneath my muscle layer and  <br>01:04:20.160 you would know if somebody has visceral  <br>01:04:21.799 fat if they have kind of a big hard  <br>01:04:24.200 belly have you ever seen that and they  <br>01:04:26.480 just kind of but if you touch it you  <br>01:04:28.039 can't make it into a roll that's  <br>01:04:30.039 visceral fat that's between your organs  <br>01:04:31.400 and that's really bad for you so vinegar  <br>01:04:33.000 helps of course this is not a magic  <br>01:04:35.079 solution that's going to fix all your  <br>01:04:36.960 issues and you know prevent ton of  <br>01:04:39.160 diseases it's a good Ally to have and  <br>01:04:41.720 I'm all about little allies you bring  <br>01:04:43.920 with you Gentle Giants you have  <br>01:04:45.440 throughout your day that are going to  <br>01:04:46.720 help you get to Health in an easy  <br>01:04:48.319 manageable way so so if I have that  <br>01:04:51.079 glass that you've just made for me which  <br>01:04:52.640 basically I can't taste the vinegar in  <br>01:04:54.160 because it's been dilated by water and  <br>01:04:56.400 then I eat something yeah remind me  <br>01:04:58.559 again of the impact that that will have  <br>01:04:59.760 on my glucose Spike so it'll reduce your  <br>01:05:03.079 glucose Spike by up to 30% and your  <br>01:05:05.359 insulin Spike also by up to 30% the way  <br>01:05:08.240 it works is that you have these little  <br>01:05:11.400 scissors in your stomach like miniature  <br>01:05:15.359 scissors called enzymes their job is to  <br>01:05:18.440 chop up the starches and sugars and turn  <br>01:05:20.920 them into individual glucose molecules  <br>01:05:22.920 it's a part of your digestive process  <br>01:05:24.960 these enzymes  <br>01:05:26.200 do this  <br>01:05:27.799 job vinegar will temporarily inactivate  <br>01:05:31.880 some of those little scissors  <br>01:05:33.119 essentially slowing down how quickly the  <br>01:05:36.039 glucose arrives into your bloodstream  <br>01:05:38.520 it's all about velocity we're all about  <br>01:05:41.200 trying to reduce the speed of arrival of  <br>01:05:43.920 glucose into your bloodstream that's the  <br>01:05:46.440 key so vinegar is a really effective way  <br>01:05:48.880 of doing this one of the things that I  <br>01:05:51.160 read online as well about glucose and  <br>01:05:52.839 again this is like conspiracy theories  <br>01:05:55.079 that are  <br>01:05:56.480 I read this is a variation of the Tweet  <br>01:05:59.279 um I'll read it out it says sugar in a  <br>01:06:02.520 baby's brain is called ADHD sugar in  <br>01:06:06.279 adult's brain is called dementia and  <br>01:06:07.960 Alzheimer's sugar in your eyes is called  <br>01:06:10.720 glycom sugar in your teeth is called  <br>01:06:13.000 cavities sugar on your skin is called  <br>01:06:15.240 Aging sugar in your sleep is called  <br>01:06:17.720 insomnia sugar in your blood is called  <br>01:06:20.799 diabetes sugar on Wall Street is called  <br>01:06:24.000 a billion dollar industry boom I get the  <br>01:06:27.480 point I think sugar is definitely one of  <br>01:06:30.000 the main drivers of all these things but  <br>01:06:32.520 there's other stuff going on of course  <br>01:06:33.839 but I like that I think the Alzheimer's  <br>01:06:35.440 one is really interesting to talk  <br>01:06:37.760 about there's a study that has followed  <br>01:06:40.880 people for 30 years and they found that  <br>01:06:45.240 people who had elevated glucose levels  <br>01:06:47.599 in their 40s were more likely to get  <br>01:06:50.920 Alzheimer's when they reach 60 70 80 so  <br>01:06:55.720 having high glucose levels at midlife is  <br>01:06:57.680 a risk factor for Alzheimer's when  <br>01:06:59.880 you're older not only that but  <br>01:07:01.960 scientists have started to see that some  <br>01:07:03.480 of the things you see in the brain of  <br>01:07:05.760 someone with Alzheimer's are actually  <br>01:07:07.520 similar to what you see in the body of  <br>01:07:10.240 somebody with diabetes namely  <br>01:07:13.359 inflammation glycation and insulin  <br>01:07:17.400 resistance so much so that some  <br>01:07:19.960 scientists call Alzheimer's type 3  <br>01:07:23.960 diabetes diabetes of the  <br>01:07:26.720 brain pretty freaking fascinating  <br>01:07:30.279 there's going to be so many people that  <br>01:07:31.760 are listening to our conversation when  <br>01:07:33.279 we talked about PCOS or Alzheimer's or  <br>01:07:36.200 all these kinds of things I think like  <br>01:07:38.480 how how is it fair that I've got these  <br>01:07:41.119 conditions when I don't even eat as much  <br>01:07:43.279 sugar as most people yeah you know they  <br>01:07:45.720 probably look at someone who is really  <br>01:07:47.799 binging out on sugar who doesn't have  <br>01:07:50.119 any of these things if I was a woman and  <br>01:07:51.839 I had PCOS and I ate just a little bit  <br>01:07:55.960 of sugar I'd be like this is not fair  <br>01:07:58.079 and a second ago when you said at 40 if  <br>01:07:59.640 you have elevated gluc glucose levels is  <br>01:08:03.079 that relative to like or is that to your  <br>01:08:06.920 response no they're looking at fasting  <br>01:08:09.240 glucose so a measure of a how diabetic  <br>01:08:11.839 you are essentially if you're healthy  <br>01:08:13.760 pre-diabetic or diabetic so it's not  <br>01:08:15.359 looking at the spikes it's looking at  <br>01:08:17.238 your Baseline in the morning which is  <br>01:08:18.799 what doctors measure with a blood test  <br>01:08:21.120 oh okay yeah yeah but Stephen life is  <br>01:08:23.960 unfair like I  <br>01:08:26.120 my glucose spikes led to terrible mental  <br>01:08:29.560 health episodes of depersonalization  <br>01:08:31.839 lots of people I know eat so much sugar  <br>01:08:33.759 all the time have never had one mental  <br>01:08:35.238 health issue in their life I like I  <br>01:08:37.439 don't have all the answers to that we  <br>01:08:39.120 just know that on average if you look at  <br>01:08:41.158 everybody by reducing those spikes  <br>01:08:42.960 you're going to reduce the likelihood of  <br>01:08:44.759 these diseases but you see people who  <br>01:08:46.439 like smoke two packs of cigarettes a day  <br>01:08:48.759 drink two liters of orange juice and  <br>01:08:50.399 live to 120 with no health issues and  <br>01:08:52.719 you have people who are perfectly  <br>01:08:54.120 healthy who get cancer at 25 and die  <br>01:08:56.640 like I'm not God I don't know but what I  <br>01:08:59.600 do know is that in a lot of cases when  <br>01:09:02.120 you have a condition that's linked to  <br>01:09:03.399 glucose levels and you apply these hacks  <br>01:09:05.238 you can get relief or remission that's  <br>01:09:07.198 all I know are there any societies where  <br>01:09:09.359 they just don't really eat sugar that  <br>01:09:11.640 you you can think of or any sort of I  <br>01:09:14.640 think any any culture any country that's  <br>01:09:16.880 been globalized and now has access to  <br>01:09:18.600 like fizzy drinks and stuff it's so  <br>01:09:19.960 addictive that stuff as soon as you  <br>01:09:21.479 introduce it somewhere everybody starts  <br>01:09:22.960 drinking it I'd love to do a continuous  <br>01:09:25.520 glucose monitor on like the heads a  <br>01:09:26.880 tribe or something in Africa and see  <br>01:09:28.839 amazing if they're like inflammation  <br>01:09:30.839 levels and stuff yeah I would do  <br>01:09:32.399 continous glucose monitor but also  <br>01:09:33.880 fasting glucose levels right to just  <br>01:09:35.640 kind of see what their Baseline is at do  <br>01:09:37.520 any of them have diabetes pre-diabetes  <br>01:09:39.799 or not at all what's going on but yeah I  <br>01:09:41.560 agree it's fascinating you mentioned a  <br>01:09:43.319 term earlier that I've only ever heard  <br>01:09:44.600 used when talking about a zmek glp1 yeah  <br>01:09:48.439 what what relationship does glucose have  <br>01:09:50.198 with gp1s and what the hell is a  <br>01:09:53.120 glp1 it's so interesting so  <br>01:09:55.960 in your digestive system you have these  <br>01:09:57.520 little cells they're called L cells and  <br>01:10:00.120 they're like little sensors and they  <br>01:10:01.960 just hang out there in your digestive  <br>01:10:03.520 tract just like chilling and doing  <br>01:10:05.040 nothing and then as soon as you eat and  <br>01:10:07.640 they sense food they wake up they're  <br>01:10:10.159 like alert we have a job to do and their  <br>01:10:12.960 job is to release a substance called  <br>01:10:16.920 glp1 this  <br>01:10:18.960 substance then goes to different parts  <br>01:10:21.120 of your body and tells you that you've  <br>01:10:22.840 eaten enough food and you can stop  <br>01:10:24.480 eating so for example you're having a  <br>01:10:26.440 big plate of  <br>01:10:27.640 pasta the starch goes into your  <br>01:10:30.239 digestive system the little L cells  <br>01:10:32.239 sense the pasta they're like oh we've  <br>01:10:33.800 eaten food and then it tells your brain  <br>01:10:35.880 Stephen you can stop eating you don't  <br>01:10:37.280 have to eat another five pounds of pasta  <br>01:10:39.280 you're

put  <br>01:10:50.320 some of that glucose away into liver  <br>01:10:53.120 muscle and fat cells so glp1  <br>01:10:55.800 is a totally normal part of our  <br>01:10:58.679 physiology it's been there

for better health.  <br>  <br>## IDEAS:  <br>- Glucose spikes can impact mental health, acne, and aging significantly.  <br>- Most fruits in supermarkets are not natural; they are bred for sweetness.  <br>- Eating sugar can lead to chronic fatigue and mitochondrial dysfunction.  <br>- Insulin resistance is linked to infertility and hormonal imbalances in women.  <br>- Vinegar can reduce glucose spikes by up to 30% when consumed before meals.  <br>- Savory breakfasts can prevent glucose spikes and maintain energy levels throughout the day.  <br>- Consuming whole fruits is better than juices for managing glucose levels.  <br>- Eating foods in a specific order can significantly lower glucose spikes.  <br>- Adding fiber-rich veggies to meals can slow glucose absorption.  <br>- Regular exercise after meals helps to lower glucose levels effectively.  <br>- Many people are unaware of how sugar impacts their health negatively.  <br>- Elevated glucose levels in midlife increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  <br>- Foods like honey and grapes can cause significant glucose spikes despite being perceived as healthy.  <br>- Continuous glucose monitors help individuals understand their dietary impacts on glucose levels.  <br>- Insulin is responsible for storing glucose in fat cells, leading to weight gain.  <br>- The relationship between glucose and mood affects daily productivity and overall happiness.  <br>- Many cultures traditionally start meals with vegetables to improve glucose management.  <br>- High glucose diets can lead to increased inflammation and health issues.  <br>- Glucose spikes can cause cravings, making it difficult to maintain a balanced diet.  <br>- Lack of sleep can worsen insulin resistance and glucose management.  <br>- Health education around glucose management can empower individuals to reclaim their health.  <br>  <br>## INSIGHTS:  <br>- Understanding glucose management can empower individuals to improve their overall health and well-being.  <br>- Dietary choices impact glucose levels, affecting physical health, mental clarity, and emotional balance.  <br>- Reducing sugar intake can lead to significant improvements in energy and mood stability.  <br>- A balanced diet incorporating proteins and healthy fats helps mitigate glucose spikes effectively.  <br>- People are often unaware of the hidden sugars in seemingly healthy foods like fruit smoothies.  <br>- Knowledge about glucose can transform health outcomes, especially for those with insulin resistance.  <br>- The importance of educating the public on glucose impacts spans beyond personal health to societal health.  <br>- Implementing small dietary hacks can lead to substantial health improvements over time.  <br>- Sustainable health practices require a combination of dietary management, exercise, and education.  <br>- The body’s response to sugar reveals deeper connections between diet, mood, and cognitive function.  <br>  <br>## QUOTES:  <br>- “80% of the population have glucose spikes every single day and that’s when problems start happening.”  <br>- “The beauty of the technology of a smart home is its scalability: you can start small.”  <br>- “Glucose spikes have a few different consequences; having a few spikes here and there is not a big deal.”  <br>- “There’s no such thing as good sugar; all sugar is the same.”  <br>- “Eating a meal in the right order reduces the glucose spike by up to 75%.”  <br>- “The more glucose spikes you have, the harder it will be for your body to manage your spikes.”  <br>- “Insulin is responsible for storing glucose in fat cells, leading to weight gain.”  <br>- “Fasting is a stressor on the body; it is a good stressor but still a stressor.”  <br>- “Savory breakfasts can prevent glucose spikes and maintain energy levels throughout the day.”  <br>- “The relationship between glucose and mood affects daily productivity and overall happiness.”  <br>- “The food landscape is toxic, and most of us just eat sugar and starches.”  <br>- “Vinegar contains acetic acid which interacts with your digestive enzymes and cuts the glucose spike.”  <br>- “The more insulin resistant you are, the more likely you are to be infertile.”  <br>- “Glucose spikes can cause cravings, making it difficult to maintain a balanced diet.”  <br>- “People often believe that if the sugar is coming from a fruit, it’s good sugar.”  <br>- “High glucose diets can lead to increased inflammation and health issues.”  <br>- “You can’t just give somebody a scientific paper; you have to explain it in a visual way.”  <br>- “Eating sugar can lead to chronic fatigue and mitochondrial dysfunction.”  <br>- “Continuous glucose monitors help individuals understand their dietary impacts on glucose levels.”  <br>- “Insulin resistance is linked to infertility and hormonal imbalances in women.”  <br>  <br>## HABITS:  <br>- Start each day with a savory breakfast to stabilize glucose levels.  <br>- Consume vinegar diluted in water before meals to reduce glucose spikes.  <br>- Incorporate fiber-rich vegetables at the beginning of meals to slow glucose absorption.  <br>- Engage in light physical activity after meals to help manage glucose levels.  <br>- Monitor glucose levels regularly using continuous glucose monitors for better health insights.  <br>- Avoid sugary snacks and replace them with healthy savory alternatives.  <br>- Prioritize sleep and manage stress to maintain healthy insulin levels.  <br>- Educate yourself on food choices and their impact on glucose levels.  <br>- Experiment with the order of food consumption to manage glucose spikes effectively.  <br>- Avoid fruit juices and opt for whole fruits to benefit from fiber content.  <br>  <br>## FACTS:  <br>- One billion people globally have either type two diabetes or pre-diabetes.  <br>- High glucose levels in midlife increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease significantly.  <br>- Continuous glucose monitors reveal how specific foods affect individual glucose responses.  <br>- 90% of participants in a study reported reduced cravings using glucose management hacks.  <br>- Insulin resistance affects hormonal balance and can lead to infertility in women.  <br>- Glucose spikes can cause fatigue and impact mental clarity throughout the day.  <br>- Savory meals are traditionally served in many cultures to promote better digestion.  <br>- Grapes, despite being a fruit, can lead to significant glucose spikes in the body.  <br>- The average person consumes a diet high in starches and sugars, impacting health negatively.  <br>- Eating starches and sugars alone leads to rapid glucose spikes and subsequent crashes.  <br>- The body’s glucose response can influence mood, energy levels, and overall productivity.  <br>- High insulin levels prevent the body from burning fat effectively.  <br>- Reducing sugar intake is linked to improved mental health and lower cravings.  <br>- Health education around glucose management can empower individuals to reclaim their health.  <br>- Fiber-rich foods help slow glucose absorption and promote better health outcomes.  <br>- The food landscape is increasingly filled with processed sugars and unhealthy options.  <br>- Eating a balanced diet with proteins, fats, and fiber is crucial for glucose management.  <br>  <br>## REFERENCES:  <br>- "The Glucose Goddess Method" by Jesse Enpay.  <br>- Continuous glucose monitors for tracking dietary impacts.  <br>- Studies on the effects of vinegar on glucose spikes.  <br>- Research linking glucose levels to mental health and aging.

Ben Greenfield: Guilty as charged.  **0:11**So how do you think about the  information overload solution then? Caleb Applegate: I think this is like a really good   lead in to talk about the advent of what you and I  have been kind of concocting, creating, building,  **0:24**crafting in the background to solve these  types of problems for everyday folks like us.**0:32**Ben Greenfield: I am super excited about  **0:44**today's show because I get to interview  my best friend. And even though you   might be wondering why the heck I'd just be  interviewing one of my pals on the podcast,  **0:53**it goes way beyond that. So if you listen to  my show, if you read my articles on my website,  **1:00**follow me on social media, or digest anything from  Ben Greenfield Life, the man at the helm of the  **1:08**amazing team working at Ben Greenfield Life.  And the president of the company is my guest  **1:14**on today's show, Caleb Applegate. Caleb, he'll  share with you his deep history and an impressive  **1:24**career leading up to, coming up to Ben Greenfield  Life. But I thought, gosh, there's so much that  **1:30**you guys get that is produced in the secret Batman  labs up here in the inland northwest that I gotta  **1:38**get the man behind the scenes on the show because  he's a wealth of knowledge, not just in business,  **1:44**but he's also tuned into the health, the  biohacking, the fitness world and beyond.**1:50**Ben Greenfield: And you're actually gonna start seeing Caleb   more and more places, too. For example, he'll  be presenting at the Health Optimization Summit  **1:56**coming up in London. Although this podcast might  be coming out after that show, you're going to see  **2:01**him a lot more popping up with some new projects  that we have going at Ben Greenfield Life as well.  **2:07**So I thought, what the heck, Caleb? I might as  well have you on the show. What do you think? Caleb Applegate: Ben, thanks for  **2:12**having me, man. Pleasure to be here. Ben Greenfield: Yeah. And you have   a pretty funny story that you tell.  I think you tell it better than me  **2:20**about how we actually connected up here in  Spokane. It involves me dirty and barefoot.**2:29**Caleb Applegate: It does involve you   dirty and barefoot, dialed in, zoned in on  one of your walking calls outside. But yeah,  **2:37**you're right. It's funny. This was right during  the middle, or actually at the beginning of  **2:43**COVID. We were looking for land. We have three  kids. My wife and I decided, hey, this is a good  **2:50**time to go get on a piece of property. And  so we actually were able to get something.**2:57**Caleb Applegate: Turns out, what, ten minutes from your old place,   North Spokane. And literally, the day that  we're moving, we're driving down the road,  **3:06**and I see this guy, barefoot, shirtless, walking  down the road, like, in the zone as you're   walking. And I'm like, wait a minute, I know this  guy. Turns out I didn't have your number anymore  **3:18**because we had met years before, through your mom,  actually, and I had to message you on Facebook,  **3:26**dude, I think we just moved ten minutes from  where you're at. We should get together. And   that kind of began the next season of our  families getting together quite often.**3:37**Ben Greenfield: Yeah. And at the time, you weren't, at least   to my recollection, you were super tuned into  the health and biohacking world at that point.**3:50**Caleb Applegate: No. That may be an understatement. No. In fact,   I would ping you all the time, if you recall, hey,  what do you think about this? Or, hey, I'm feeling  **4:00**a certain way, and you would always send me,  because you've probably written about literally  **4:06**everything. You have, the Bible. With Boundless,  it's easy for you to just like, hey, check out  **4:12**this article, or, I just did this podcast, or  you'd really get a lot of information extracted  **4:17**out of this new thing we just put out. And so  it was like you were the information repository,  **4:24**and I was like, holy smokes, this guy is dialed  in. I have to just have to keep asking questions.**4:30**Caleb Applegate: So I was probably that,   at least at first, that annoying  guy that kept pinging you.**4:36**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, it kind of went both ways, though,   because you were, like, the expert on business  building, the metaverse, information technology,  **4:45**crypto, all these things I didn't know much  about. I think that would actually be interesting   for people. Before we talk about the direction  that you've taken with health and fitness and  **4:55**what your routines and rituals are looking like  now. Where'd you actually come from before that? Caleb Applegate: Right, yeah, no, it's a great  **5:01**question. In fact, a pastor friend of ours likes  to say, God draws straight with crooked lines, and  **5:08**I'm definitely that crooked line story. And so,  yeah, years ago, I started in the entertainment  **5:15**space. I was blessed enough to have my first film  produced by Leonardo DiCaprio's company, Appian  **5:23**Way. And so that was kind of the first push into  the film industry, into the entertainment space,  **5:30**and it was an amazing experience, once in a  lifetime opportunity. I was able to take my  **5:35**family, but we made the decision at that  point that we didn't want to live in LA  **5:41**and raise our kids in LA. And so we landed  in Moscow, Idaho, where I would eventually  **5:48**meet you and other really great friends.  And we fell in love with the community.**5:54**Caleb Applegate: And we knew because we were making   that choice, the entertainment industry might  not be as accessible. I would have to travel a  **6:01**lot. And so we looked at alternative opportunities  on more of a local level. And it was through that  **6:09**that I opened a restaurant. And Moscow was  able to experiment with a few startups, but  **6:15**ultimately started offering consulting services.  And it wasn't that I put myself out there as the  **6:22**people would ask me advice on things, or, hey,  would you be willing to step in and help with  **6:30**this particular project? And one of  those projects, as it turns out, was a   Minecraft gaming server that needed some business  development executive help. And so I was able to,  **6:42**kind of the TLDR version of that was, I'm  not a gamer at all, but I did love business,  **6:50**and so was able to make the connection  with Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks,  **6:57**and envision and dream the American  Airlines center arena inside of Minecraft.  **7:04**And so ultimately this got the attention of  Microsoft and Mojang, all things considered.**7:10**Caleb Applegate: Long story short,   our server, Mineplex, was one of three that  helped pioneer the Minecraft marketplace that  **7:17**we know today. And we were super early, but  helped kind of build that all out. So it was  **7:23**an amazing experience. Then you mentioned  metaverse. This is where things get even  **7:29**more just funny and odd. It was through the  gaming ecosystem, we were using this gaming  **7:41**community connector. It was called Enjin.  This was pre-NFTs, pre-Enjin Coin ICO.**7:52**Caleb Applegate: We were using the   Enjin client. And so through that process  of getting to know the team over there,  **8:00**we started working together. And so they  brought me on as an advisor. And then  **8:05**after a good amount of time of helping  them kind of see things a bit different,  **8:11**they asked if I would come on board as a COO. So  I ran Enjin, which was then a top 50 blockchain  **8:17**company for four years. Had a blast, have huge  respect for those guys. Was able to co-found a  **8:24**token over there called EFI on Polkadot. And so,  yeah, became it was just all things blockchain.**8:31**Caleb Applegate: Taking what I've learned   from gamification, but really digging into the  software stack of things and understanding how  **8:39**information moves. Consequently, or I should  say, incidentally, Enjin pioneered the whole  **8:47**concept of a non-fungible token. This was  early days, 2017, right alongside cryptopunks,  **8:55**Witek Radomski, the CTO and co-founder of  Enjin, pioneered ERC 1155 standard and had  **9:04**envisioned this whole, what we coined a  multiverse where a game could mint items,  **9:12**melt them and remint them in another game. In  fact, it was a non-fungible token that actually  **9:19**had value in an ecosystem of interoperability. So  that's the whole metaverse Web3 NFT intersection.**9:30**Ben Greenfield: So my very rudimentary understanding   of that would be like the ninja sort of power  that I acquired in one game could actually  **9:36**have some type of value and be traded across  a different platform or something like that?**9:42**Caleb Applegate: Yep, absolutely. Absolutely. And Vtech had   such an incredible pioneering vision for this. I  mean, the stuff that Enjin did and has been doing  **9:53**still is just incredible, cutting edge. Again,  I have nothing but huge respect for those guys.**9:59**Ben Greenfield: Well, you've come a long way, baby,   because now you and I have conversations about the  EMF and blue light levels of VR headsets and how  **10:10**they could be heating and destroying tissue in the  brain. And so you've pivoted a little bit, man.**10:15**Caleb Applegate: I have pivoted a little bit. Look,   so blockchain has been a blast. I still kind  of dabble. And I sit on a board of a company  **10:25**called Passage that previously I was the  CEO of and another just incredible team.  **10:33**I love it. I think the principles behind  blockchain, governance, participation,  **10:41**bringing community together. An infinite ledger  of transaction history, immutability, trustless.  **10:48**I think so many principles that are embedded  in the DNA of blockchain, I just naturally  **10:56**gravitate towards. It's easy for me to talk  about what is money, who assigns it its value.**11:02**Caleb Applegate: The advent of bitcoin   introduced all sorts of, I think, very  critical, very compelling narratives,  **11:10**and we should be asking these questions. However,  you and I got together and started just talking  **11:17**about the world of health and wellness. And  this was really my own journey of having   some health issues and admittedly being a  little bit, just a little bit overweight.**11:28**Ben Greenfield: But you had an excuse for the   sector that you were working in. I mean, it's kind  of funny because, not to distract us too much,  **11:36**but River and Terran, my sons and I are headed  over to America's biggest gaming convention called  **11:42**Gen Con because my sons have started this card  game and board game business. And we were watching  **11:48**the instructional video for registration and  kind of like looking at videos of previous year's  **11:56**conferences and I warned them, I'm like, guys,  this is not going to be a fitness convention,   right? And not the stereotype. I'm going to offend  a lot of gamers. I'm sure. But I told them you  **12:05**guys are probably going to see a lot of giant  monster energy drinks, neck beards, piercings,  **12:12**goth makeup, giant oversized t-shirts, and people  playing Dungeons & Dragons and Catan until like  **12:19**3 a.m. under blue lights. Like, just be prepared  that this is the sector that we're venturing into.**12:25**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, no, it's true.   It's true. I think the background backend  principles of gaming, usability, engineering,  **12:39**what draws a person to use a product, that  type of conversation and kind of deep dive  **12:48**diligence is what I gravitate towards.  I want to know what makes people tick,   what they like, what they need, what's part of  their everyday rhythm, what makes them better.**13:01**Ben Greenfield: Now, since I brought you   on to Ben Greenfield Life, I'm just curious, what  has changed? I realize that's a loaded question  **13:10**as far as like your routine, what you've learned,  what big changes that you've made because you've  **13:15**transformed your body. I know that you're doing  a lot now as far as your own routine, what have  **13:22**been the biggest game changers for you in your  own routine, things that you've picked up here?**13:27**Caleb Applegate: Well, you've had   two guests on your podcast that made a huge  impact on me. Number one, Dallas Jenkins,  **13:35**who is a friend of yours, also a friend of  mine. Dallas was the original individual that  **13:44**got me into the film industry and helped  me out, introduced me to my entertainment  **13:50**attorney. And this is way back. This is  like 2000, I want to say 2007, maybe.**13:56**Ben Greenfield: By the way,   I'll link to that in the show notes.  Bengreenfieldlife.com/applegate is where the  **14:02**show notes are. Bengreenfieldlife.com/applegate,  Caleb's last name. But Dallas Jenkins, and I'll  **14:08**put that interview in there, he directed The  Chosen, which a lot of people are familiar with.**14:14**Caleb Applegate: Yep, he did. He's had an incredible journey,   but he gave some very practical, everyday habits  and disciplines that really spoke to me when I  **14:26**listened to that podcast. And I hadn't connected  with Dallas since he had done The Chosen,   it's been a while. But it was like, hey,  I can do this. This isn't actually that  **14:37**difficult. I can do this. Another gentleman  you had on your podcast was Michael Chernow,   Kreatures of Habit and his discipline stack.  I had to relisten to that over and over.**14:49**Caleb Applegate: I'm like, this guy has his shit together. He is   so dialed. I would say between those two and then  just being around you and just, you know, I don't  **15:02**want to be like the guy that looks like you just  ate a bag of Doritos. I want to actually, like,  **15:08**try to be better. And being around you, listening  to a few of, some of the guests that you've had  **15:15**on, I'm like, look, I've got to get serious  about this. On top of that, I have a wife who's,  **15:22**so I'm 6'3", she's 5'3", and she's a personal  trainer and loves homeopathy. Like, she has been  **15:29**the champion in our family, really pressing for  better health, better food, better environment,  **15:37**just all the way around, better ecosystem.  And I'm the guy that's been like, you know,   I have to work, I have to build, I have to create.**15:44**Caleb Applegate: I have to, you know,   make a better life for my family. All the  while, my own body is breaking down. And  **15:51**so I finally started listening to her who says,  look at these things and listen to what Ben is  **15:59**saying, like, do these things. So  I think it's been an amalgam of a   bunch of different variables that have been  very influential into my current routine.**16:09**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I get that   sometimes the spouse who says, you can't believe  how much money you've cost me after my significant  **16:17**other recommended the insert podcast here, the  Red Light podcast, the Toxic Mattress podcast,  **16:24**et cetera. So my apologies to folks who have  had their spouse introduce them to my podcast,  **16:31**but it's kind of funny. Caleb, a couple of  things came up for me as you were talking   about those podcasts that were a couple of  your favorites, the Dallas Jenkins show. I  **16:39**also learned a ton from that, one of the big  takeaways. And I don't know if you tried this,   he had debilitating low back pain. And one  of the recommendations that he gave on there,  **16:51**amongst a lot of really great recommendations for  low back pain, was to foam roll your butt. Foam  **16:56**roll your butt. And I started doing that more  intensively, like two or three times a week.**17:02**Ben Greenfield: And it is incredible   how if you kind of sit on a foam roller, you  kind of slap one leg on top of the other leg,  **17:08**and you start at the base of your knee and just  shimmy your body all the way up to your butt,   get up to your butt, weave back and forth, dig  into the tissue, then go back down to the knee,  **17:19**and you do that as about like ten passes or  so per side. And then I'll even lay myself  **17:24**on top of the foam roller and kind of like,  bring. This is difficult to describe an audio,   but I'm going to try it. I'll loop one  leg over the other leg and kind of like,  **17:33**crack the back on one side and then loop over the  other leg and crack the back on the other side.  **17:38**Not. That's an incredible move. Did you try any of  the butt foam rolling after listening to that one?**17:44**Caleb Applegate: Yeah. No, look, I didn't just   try it. I've been doing it every single day since  then. Um, that is the single biggest game changer,  **17:52**because a lot like Dallas, I, too, have lower  back pain. Or did. So I didn't just get a roller,  **17:59**though. I actually got one of those theragun  rollers where you can, like, create vibration.**18:05**Caleb Applegate: Oh, dude, game   changer. Love it. I do it every morning.  So my morning stack is a little bit of a  **18:12**blend of what Michael Chernow talked about and  Dallas talked about. So I start with rolling.  **18:18**So I'll do that a good, you know, 10, 15  minutes. And I do butt, legs, feet even.**18:25**Caleb Applegate: Then I'll jump into a workout,   usually 30 to 45 minutes. Oftentimes it's  walking or running or I do a lot of, like,  **18:34**peloton biking, which is really fun. And then I'll  jump into the sauna, do that for 25 to 30 minutes,  **18:40**hit the cold plunge. Thanks to our friends at  Morozko, I love their tub. And then have some  **18:49**quiet, meditative time, prayer time, and jump  into my workday. So even during the workouts,  **18:54**though, I'll be. I'm kind of addicted to work.  I love what I do, so I'm constantly just. Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I want to dig   into your ritual a little bit more. But you also  mentioned Michael Chernow, and apparently he went  **19:04**and flew down in high school with Lance Armstrong  in Texas. Recently, I just found out about this,   and Lance actually invested in that company  that Michael and I talked about on the show,  **19:13**the Kreatures of Habit Meal One. These little  done-for-you oatmeal packets. And I got some  **19:19**of those after the interview with him. What  I do is I soak them overnight in half-apple  **19:27**cider vinegar and half-water. And these are,  like, nostalgic flavors that you might remember   from Quaker oatmeal, if you're listening in.  Like, blueberry, and they got, like, a maple.**19:36**Ben Greenfield: It's fantastic. They   got chocolate. They got a vanilla apple cinnamon,  which is definitely nostalgic to the Quaker piece.  **19:43**You soak it overnight. These are glyphosate  free oats, and it makes, like, this kind of,   like, mushy pudding that I can use as a smoothie  filler that I can use for dessert. Like, a lot of  **19:54**times my dessert is yogurt with dark chocolate and  berries. But sometimes I'll put a spoonful of that   Meal One in there. And for travel, it's incredible  because you got these packets, you mix them up,  **20:05**you know, hotel room, you don't want to go  down to the nasty continental breakfast. Ben Greenfield: I'll even, I don't   know if I told you this, Caleb. I'll surf to  the airport. I go up to Starbucks when I want  **20:13**to have a meal in the airport because I always  have a couple of the Meal One packets in my bag,  **20:18**and I asked them what I say so I can get free  hot water because some of these basketballs will  **20:24**charge, like, $0.75 for hot water. As I say, it's  not technically a lie, but I say I have oatmeal,  **20:31**but I forgot to get hot water. Do you have hot  water in a spoon that you can give me in a cup?  **20:37**I'm sure they think I probably got the oatmeal  at Starbucks, and we're gonna get hot water at   Starbucks. But anyways, they graciously give me  the hot water, the spoon, I mix up the oatmeal,  **20:46**and this is like, you know, usually as I'm  walking to my gate, by the time I get to my gate,   it's soaked in that hot water. It's nice,  it's mushy, and I can have a meal if I'm  **20:54**traveling. And even though I often fast when I  travel, some of these longer bouts, you know,   if I've worked out in the morning, whatever,  I want some to, some to crush, it's healthy.**21:03**Ben Greenfield: So the Meal One, I'm glad you brought it up,   because that's been a winner, and it stops for  me. I got a whole pantry full of those things.**21:10**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, same. I have it   five days a week. Uh, typically, we do something  else on the weekends because we're together as a  **21:17**family, but during the week, again, game  changers. Super practical in a packet,  **21:23**and I'm moving so quick on, you know, just,  uh, in my routine in the mornings because  **21:29**I've got so much on my plate for the day,  so I've got to be ultra disciplined, like,   down to the minute. So its really  nice to just take that packet,  **21:36**dump it in. I take some walnut halves, throw it  in. I love putting the Kion colostrum into that.**21:44**Caleb Applegate: I mean, it just makes   it milky and smooth and so good. Put  some water in, maybe cut up a banana  **21:51**and a pinch of colima salt. I dont know  if youve done that. So good, man. So good.**21:57**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, its incredible. This is   turning a giant commercial for Kreatures of Habit.  But one more tip is when you soak it overnight,  **22:03**even though it's got, like, pumpkin seeds  and chia seeds, got all this stuff in it,   you put a few scoopfuls of chia seeds in  there, and it turns into, like, this thick,  **22:11**gelatinous pudding. So you can make it  even thicker with the addition of chia   seeds before you do the overnight soak. So  you gotta try that one if you haven't yet.**22:18**Caleb Applegate: As it turns out,   man, you and I are foodies.  We like to eat good food. Ben Greenfield: I know, I know.  **22:24**How has your diet actually changed since you  started? Kind of like, soaking up a lot more   from Ben Greenfield life and working behind the  scenes, you know, chatting with partners, like,  **22:34**you know, Kreatures of Habit or whatever  else, getting your hands on a lot of this   stuff. I'm just curious how it's evolved,  because, well, I mean, I'll open the kimono  **22:42**on this a little bit. You know, the town that  you and I kind of originate from and met in is  **22:49**a town that has a very kind of, like. It's  like a large reformed protestant community,  **22:56**the church that you and I attended. But  it's very much like giant Sabbath feasts   and cigar and whiskey. And it's not necessarily  focused that much on healthy diets, per se.**23:07**Ben Greenfield: I was a part of that   culture. I know you were. But I'm just  curious how it's changed from kind of  **23:12**like that general mentality to being a little  bit more aware of your nutrients in your diet.**23:19**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, well, look, you   are right. The community and culture that we've  been a part of is rich and beautiful and glorious  **23:28**and just eat the fat, really lean in and enjoy  God's bounty. I think for me personally, because  **23:38**every body type is different, being more aware  of what I'm putting into my body. In other words,  **23:45**you know, I have a propensity to like sugar  and sweets. You know, cheesecake is probably  **23:54**one of the biggest things that I've, at  least recently been, having to navigate.**23:59**Ben Greenfield: Especially, by the way,   at my mom's coffee shop that you alluded  to, they had pretty hefty cheesecake there.**24:05**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, 100%. And so I just. It's discipline,   right? I don't say no. I say sometimes, and I try  to work for it. One of the tips that you gave me,  **24:16**and this has been also a game changer. I was  actually sharing this with some folks at a new gym  **24:22**that I joined yesterday. And that is like going  to bed hungry, right? It's okay to be hungry.  **24:30**Right before the opposite of that was, I'm eating  so much that I'm constantly full. I feel bloated,  **24:38**I feel heavy, I feel thick. Going on a walk after  dinner, and I'm just like, this is miserable.**24:44**Caleb Applegate: The opposite of that   is eat just enough, portion out what you need.  Really. What is it that you need? That's the  **24:50**question that I've been asking myself. And the  feeling of being satisfied and then turning into  **24:57**that hungry state right before bed, it feels at  first you're like, man, I want to go snack or  **25:05**something. But if you hold the line, you feel  so much better. And your mind is clearer, too.**25:12**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, there's a certain character   developing, stoic, shut up, the inner bitch type  of mentality that's involved with going to bed  **25:22**hungry. But it's kind of funny, because before you  moved down to Moscow, you and I used to have a lot  **25:28**of these conversations over dinner, and I haven't  even filled you in on this yet, but now I think   you can have your cake and eat it, too. So I'll  tell you why. You know our mutual friend Martin,  **25:36**who you're doing the Shark Tank Panel with at  the Health Optimization Summit. Martin Tobias. Caleb Applegate: Love Martin. Yep.**25:42**Ben Greenfield: Okay. I don't remember   if you were at this dinner. We were down at  Lodgepole in Moscow. Let me know if this.  **25:48**If this jogs your memory or if you weren't at  this dinner. And Martin, who's also a foodie,  **25:53**he comes in, and I'd already ordered up,  like, five killer appetizers. It was, like,   pork belly and deviled eggs and these beautiful  salads. And, you know, they're wonderful.**26:04**Ben Greenfield: You know, fresh   baked warm bread with the butter there.  They put all sorts of herbs into. And  **26:09**Martin ponies up. He sits down, and I'm  watching. During the whole dinner, he has,  **26:15**like, a couple of glasses of water and half  of one of the deviled eggs. And he's like,  **26:21**I'm just not hungry. He's like, I can't eat. And  it turns out that he had started onto a zemp, the  **26:27**GLP-1 agonist, to try it out. Hopefully, I'm not  outing Martin on this show. My apologies, Martin.**26:33**Caleb Applegate: We were there. I remember this. Ben Greenfield: Yeah, okay. You were   there. He couldn't. He was nauseous. And that was  when I first started thinking about GLP-1. Now,  **26:41**long story short, since then, I've written  a lot of articles and done podcasts and some   of the dangers of long-term use of that peptide.  But the mechanism of action is to increase GLP-1  **26:52**to GLP-1 agonists, as the name implies. And that  makes you feel full. Well, since then I've been  **26:59**looking at other agents that could act similarly  that give you the same release of satiety-inducing  **27:05**hormones. There's three of them, namely GLP, one  called CCK, one called PYY. Turns out that you  **27:14**can consume certain compounds that make you feel  full and satiated, meaning you can eat less for  **27:21**say dinner or lunch if that's your vice, go to  bed, feel satisfied, but also you've eaten less.**27:31**Ben Greenfield: And two of the most powerful things   I've found besides ketone. I used to use ketones  for this for a long time, like the drinkable  **27:37**ketone esters. And now the two things are, you can  increase GLP-1 production and appetite-regulating  **27:47**hormones via your microbiome. This company called  Pendulum, they've been sponsored the podcast in  **27:53**the past. They have a probiotics called the GLP-1  probiotic. And again, I don't remember if I've  **27:59**told you about these two, Caleb, but you take it  when you wake up in the morning and it stabilizes  **28:04**your appetite throughout the day. It's acromantia,  albutericum and lactobacillus probiotic blended  **28:10**together. So that's one strategy, but  then the second one is even more powerful.**28:15**Ben Greenfield: So if you can trigger the   bitter receptors in your small intestine, then  you don't get hungry. The problem is the amount  **28:24**of bitterness that it takes to do that is highly  unpalatable. Like a lot of people will say, oh,  **28:30**use apple cider vinegar or the peels of certain  citrus fruits or bitter meal and extract or  **28:35**whatever. None of those are bitter enough to make  you full. They're bitter enough to decrease your  **28:40**blood glucose response to a meal, but not to make  you full. So there is an extract of hops, the same  **28:47**stuff that you would use to make beer. And this  company in New Zealand, they figured out how to  **28:53**extract it. It's a compound called amasarate, and  they put the capsule in a little lipid medium.**29:03**Ben Greenfield: You swallow it, it goes through your stomach   intact, it opens up in your small intestine, hits  all the bitter receptors without you having to  **29:11**taste it on your tongue because you literally like  puke, it's so bitter. And your fullness, if you  **29:16**do this, say like a couple of capsules an hour  before lunch, a couple capsules an hour before   dinner. Again, you don't. It's almost dangerous  because you want to enjoy your meal and you still  **29:27**enjoy it a little bit. But you don't think about  food. You go to bed, super full. It's almost,  **29:32**you know, you got to warn people, hey, be careful  not to lose too much weight, lose too much muscle,   etcetera. But those two are incredible. If,  you know, if you like me or a foodie and just  **29:43**go to bed thinking about food, you got to try  at least one or both of those at some point.**29:49**Caleb Applegate: Good to know.   Yeah. There's so many, I think, different  things to try here, and for me right now,  **30:00**I'm just trying to develop mental clarity  and discipline. I think it starts there.  **30:06**If I can change my mindset on things, to me  that's the biggest thing. And I have found  **30:12**personally that that's the biggest  obstacle out of the gate to conquer.**30:17**Ben Greenfield: Yeah. This is something I wanted   to ask you about because I know you've thought  about this a lot, coming from your background  **30:23**in gamification, in even community building and  accountability. What do you think is the biggest  **30:31**barrier? People who are listening in and they've  already heard about foam rolling your butt and   soaking oatmeal and chia seeds and taking a  GLP-1 agonist mimicking device and exogenous  **30:41**ketones and the Morozko cold plunge. What do you  think is the biggest barrier for people who are  **30:48**tuning into podcasts like this and just getting  dizzy in terms of the advice on how to implement?**30:54**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, it's a great   question. And I would say, and this is  just me speaking personally for myself  **30:59**and my family. It's information overload.  Like, where do you begin? What is it? Okay,  **31:06**this is the information. Why should I care? Where  does it intersect with my personal values and  **31:13**how I want to orient my life and how. And how I  think most people get tripped up because there's  **31:19**a lot of information out there. There's a lot of  influencers, brands and products and services,  **31:26**and where do you even begin? Right. It is,  it's just information complete overload.**31:34**Ben Greenfield: Guilty as charged.   So how do you think about the  information overload solution then?**31:42**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, I mean, this is just, again, personally   anecdotal. We have been walking this journey with  the Greenfield family and with a few other key  **31:53**folks like our good friend Dr. Leland Stillman,  who's been tremendous in my family's life. And  **32:00**through this process, we recognize that; a, we can  do better, b, there's a good chunk of information,  **32:12**c, how do you activate it? I think for our family,  the how has been a bit nebulous at times. It isn't  **32:22**always solvable by just changing up a supplement  or eating at different times or eating different  **32:30**portions. There are so many different variables.  And so I think this is like really good lead in to  **32:36**talk about the advent of what you and I have  been kind of concocting, creating, building,  **32:43**crafting in the background to solve these  types of problems for everyday folks like us.**32:52**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, yeah, I want to talk   about that for sure. But I don't want to leave  behind one thing. You mentioned Dr. Stillman.  **32:57**He's been on the show before. He's a genius when  it comes to the type of testing that he does,   and then the replenishment program that you start  on afterwards. What'd you learn from him? Or was  **33:08**there anything you found out about your body  that you changed after working with Leland? Caleb Applegate: Yeah. One thing that I really  **33:14**respect about Dr. Stillman is just that he's calm,  he's collected, and he doesn't panic. Right. You  **33:22**might have an issue or you might think you're  dying. He's like, no, you're not. And here's what  **33:28**we need to do. And I like that calm, disciplined,  sober-minded leadership. So it isn't just applying  **33:36**medical prowess or information that he has,  it's also his guidance through the process.**33:43**Caleb Applegate: And so I think   what he and I have talked about over the  past several years, or couple of years,  **33:51**is just how to make the process easier for  everyday folks. What do I mean by that?  **34:00**Everyone is bio custom individual. You might see  a great advertisement for the latest supplement  **34:08**package. Doesn't mean that you need that  though. And I think that's something I've   come to learn. Some products look incredibly  sexy and I want to try this and it's awesome.**34:18**Ben Greenfield: It does mean you need it if your neighbor   or your favorite biohacker or transhumanist is  taking it to live to 160, it must be, right?**34:26**Caleb Applegate: Exactly. But I think what   working with Dr. Stillman has shown me is that  that isn't always the case. Everybody's different.  **34:35**Every body is different. And so using that as  your starting point and going what's your body  **34:42**telling you? What data can we extract from, say a  Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis? You might have heavy  **34:51**metals that's creating toxicity in your body.  You might be deficient. You and I, Ben, we live  **34:57**in the Pacific Northwest, which means we might  not get as much vitamin D as someone that lives   down in Arizona, right? So there are variables  and factors that play into this. And so as  **35:08**this bio custom outlook kind of takes shape, it's  important to know that it's not one size fits all.**35:17**Caleb Applegate: And that's been a game   changer in our family because we would just go  with the typical supplements protocol or typical,  **35:26**hey, this influencer says we need this. Turns  out our chemistry might not actually need that.**35:33**Ben Greenfield: The HTMA, the Hair   Tissue Mineral Analysis that you mentioned.  I actually really like that. It's a perfect  **35:39**example of what you're talking about, right? It's  like 100, maybe a little bit more, dollar test.  **35:45**You get it. And a lot of people are like, well,  it only tells me minerals and toxins. It doesn't   tell me everything else, but everything from your  copper to your zinc ratios to your sodium levels,  **35:54**potassium levels, indicators of sympathetic  and parasympathetic nervous system balance.  **35:59**There is a ton that you can glean from  that one test. I actually took Leland's  **36:04**entire HTMA course to learn how to interpret  it better and just learned that, oh my gosh,   this is more than just like a simple hair  test for metals and toxins and minerals.**36:13**Ben Greenfield: Like, it goes pretty deep.   And it is kind of cool how even though you can do  like, I've interviewed the folks from Wild Health,  **36:21**the fancy multi-thousand dollar executive  panel and the full body mris and the full   genome analysis and the metabolomics report for  fatty acids and amino acids and micronutrients  **36:32**and all these things that you can do that  we, and certainly people like Dr. Stillman  **36:38**walk people through. The HTMA is a perfect  example of taking the seemingly complex world  **36:45**of self-quantification and at least trying  to introduce some amount of simplicity to it. Caleb Applegate: 100%. It gives you a baseline to build  **36:52**off of data is important. It's really important.  And I would say that data without overload is a  **37:02**great starting point. Just show me the basics  that explain how I'm feeling, maybe why I'm  **37:09**feeling a certain way, so that we can quickly get  into the how. How do we start to solve for this?**37:16**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I mean, I know that you. It's kind   of interesting because you're unique. I may call  you an Avatar, Caleb, even though you're not blue,  **37:24**your unique avatar in that. You know, I met you  when you were really wanting to be healthier.  **37:33**You're super interested in a lot of the biohacks  that I was talking about. And for a lot of people,  **37:39**it is not to kick that live to 160 horse to death,  but it's not about bragging rights for living the  **37:45**longest time or owning the half-million dollars  worth of biohacks or whatever. It's more about  **37:53**having more productivity being unleashed to create  more wealth, having time available and left over  **38:01**after your fitness and your self-preservation  efforts for family and hobbies and career and  **38:08**social life, etc. And so, you know, I would  love to hear how you kind of, you know, in your  **38:16**situation, think about or thought about or began  to tackle this issue that you kind of ran into.**38:22**Ben Greenfield: At least I think   this is the way you kind of explained  to me, like, just knowing me, you know,   as my friend, you get bombarded with a lot  of information. Then once you came on at Ben  **38:31**Greenfield Life is just more information through  the firehose of health. And, you know, you kind  **38:39**of came up with some solutions or potential ways  to reduce some of that complexity and confusion.**38:46**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, you're absolutely right. And again,   so much of what you and I have talked about has  been anecdotal. This is me personally, my family,  **38:55**and our personal journey. And part of the issues  that we've hit up against time and time again is;  **39:03**a, there's a ton of information out there,  b, what do you do with it? And does all of  **39:09**it pertain to you? Right. You might see really  cool supplements, but they may not be for your  **39:17**bio custom individual self. And every body  is different, as we said earlier. So it's  **39:23**sifting through all the noise. There's a  lot of noise, but it doesn't stop there.**39:28**Caleb Applegate: Let's say you get down   a path with a functional medicine doctor. How do  you know if it's working? You started taking those  **39:35**supplements. Do you feel better? Is it placebo?  Are you really starting to see change? There's new  **39:41**and different ideas and opinions and things that  are always surfacing. Right. Who do you listen to?**39:48**Ben Greenfield: Right? Or worse yet, by the way,   because I run into this a lot, you listen to like  20 different podcasts, and you've woven through  **39:56**maybe like four or five different doctors, and  you've got like four shells in your pantry of  **40:03**all the supplements and creams and lotions and  transdermals that you started on with one person  **40:08**or heard about on a podcast, and now you just  kind of almost like, dizzy when you walk into   your pantry or open your refrigerator trying to  figure out what to take and what's right for you.**40:19**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, exactly. And the thing that you   and I have discussed a ton through this process  of my journey, my family's journey, is if that's  **40:29**happening with us, we can surely assume that it's  happening with a lot of other folks out there. And  **40:36**so as you and I started thinking through, not just  the problems, but what could potential solutions  **40:44**look like. We've, from the outset, been thinking  about what we're coining as the every person.  **40:52**Right. We think about the folks who are busy  running their kids back and forth from school  **40:58**and husbands going to work and trying to build a  career. We're not just talking about, you know,  **41:05**the elites, the top tier class A executives.  We're talking about folks, just everyday folks,  **41:12**who know something is off. We're trying to figure  out easy solutions for that group of folks.**41:21**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, it's a really good point too,   because I get this a lot. People come up to me at  conferences or at events and they're like, well,  **41:27**I want to get healthy, but I'm not as extreme  as you. Or they think the person I'm talking  **41:33**to is the elite biohacker or they have to sign  up for some super duper, admittedly expensive  **41:40**private VIP coaching program with me in order to  get healthy. And that's one thing that you and I  **41:46**have been talking about just the past few months  is I've created journeys and transformations, but  **41:53**they're expensive and they're one-on-one and you  got to sign up to work with me. And furthermore,  **41:59**like I don't even work with more than ten people  in a month, but yet we have all this information,  **42:06**all this content, all these connections, all  these vetted and curated companies and products,  **42:14**all of these, all this information. But you're a  way better architect than me, Caleb. Cause for me,  **42:23**you walk into my office, it's not exactly  clean, but I kind of know where everything is.   Whereas you're good at kind of  architecting a journey for someone,  **42:32**to so-called transformation or something, that  they might be seeking in the world of health.**42:38**Ben Greenfield: So when you presented   to me the idea of the next evolution of Ben  Greenfield Life, I was actually pretty excited  **42:48**about it. But I'd love for you to share in  your own words what you were kind of like   laying awake thinking about at night and then,  you know, voxering me about in the mornings.**42:58**Caleb Applegate: Well, you are correct.   You are the mad scientist, right? I go into your  zen den and you've got the coolest gadgets on the  **43:06**planet and they're all, like, incredible in their  own right. The question that you and I have been  **43:12**wrestling with is how do we take that and somehow  make that or a version of that or information,  **43:19**the science behind that available to all people.  And so yeah, we really started transitioning to  **43:28**what if. What if there was a place, one place,  not walled gardens everywhere, which you see in  **43:35**a lot of different spaces, especially in the  health and wellness space. What if there was   one house with lots of different rooms? Rooms  with the best products, the best curated core  **43:47**contributing experts in their various fields,  all in that health and wellness space. What  **43:54**if they could offer their services? And what  if you could build community around that? So,  **43:59**in essence, what if it was the public square  of all things transformation geared for you  **44:07**and for your desired health transformation  outcomes. Like, this is a game changer.**44:12**Caleb Applegate: And this was the thing that I think   you and I together identified early on is that  that didn't really exist. And the what if became,  **44:22**well, let's build it. Let's start putting  the pieces together. Where do we begin? And  **44:27**that's where the architecture really came  into place. But you've built a lifetime of  **44:33**incredible relationships. You've tried some  of the coolest gear on the planet, really.  **44:38**My job is just now building the architecture  that connects it all and threads the needle. Ben Greenfield: Early on, we were talking about podcasts,  **44:46**right? There's maybe somebody subscribes like  15 different health podcasts. So you have all   this information flying out there. It's not  structured. You don't know exactly what to do  **44:55**with it. But you have this information jumbling  around inside your head, and you're grabbing a   little bit here and a little bit there, and maybe  have a few friends who are doing the same thing,  **45:04**but they might listen to a few different podcasts  and have their own approach. And then from a book  **45:09**standpoint, you've got something like Boundless,  right, which you referred to as the Bible earlier   in the podcast. Well, that's also kind of  a cookbook full of a lot of information,  **45:19**but you don't necessarily open it, take your  finger, point, click, and all of a sudden be  **45:24**able to have a program designed for you that  leaps out from the, say, the sleep chapter or  **45:32**the hormones chapter or the longevity chapter.  And so what got me excited when I was talking  **45:38**to you early on in this process of what do we  do with all this information to actually make  **45:43**it accessible in a way that allows to someone,  that allows someone to actually time hack this,  **45:50**transform themselves, but also kind of like,  have all these experts in your back pocket,  **45:55**like, actually accessible to you to be able  to be like, hey, Ben, I have a question. Ben Greenfield: Hey, you know, I'm going to hop on the Wednesday  **46:01**AMA and ask Ben this, and it correlates directly  to the program that's been created for me that me  **46:07**and other members of a community are following to,  say, optimize sleep, or optimize hormones or lose  **46:13**fat or we're on a, you know, a transformation  challenge this month for, say, buttery hips and  **46:21**mobility, or whatever the case may be. So we threw  around a few ideas, but I don't remember which one  **46:30**of us or a team member or whatever came up with  the idea of, like, a network? We bandied about a  **46:38**few terms, but really what we've settled on is  this idea of a life network, right? All things  **46:46**life optimization within one network that's not  expensive, that consolidates all this information,  **46:55**that gives you access to your favorite experts  and also gives you a roadmap to follow and a  **47:01**community to support you and have fun with  you along that journey of transformation.**47:08**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, no, beautifully   said. Here's the thing. I've spent years  and years and years designing products,  **47:15**experiences using gamification, really  digging into usability, engineering this  **47:21**next chapter of my life together with you and  the tremendous team at Ben Greenfield Life.  **47:28**We want to help you design your outcomes,  design your transformation outcomes. This  **47:34**is about you and your journey. Again, so much  of this was anecdotal for me and my family,  **47:40**right? I ignored, ignored, ignored. Now I'm  like information overload. How do I distill  **47:47**it and create act real action orientation around  it? Not just I'm going to get a gym membership,  **47:54**not just I'm going to try to get a little bit  more sleep or that's a cool supplement over there.**48:00**Caleb Applegate: We want you to connect with things that are going   to create real, lasting, both short and long-term  true transformation. So it's, yeah, Life Network  **48:10**is, I think, it's the future. I think it takes the  power of data tracking with wearables and a lot  **48:18**of the cool products that are out there. And it  also lets us, like, that's a foundational building  **48:23**block. It allows us to use that data coupled with  real community data points. Like, how did you  **48:32**participated in a challenge? You did that workout.  Who's tracking that? And one of the beautiful  **48:38**things with Life Network is that we emphasize four  key things: mind, body, spirit, and community.**48:46**Caleb Applegate: These are the things that we've identified   as our core pillars. What if you could have, this  goes back to the what if, right? What if you could  **48:54**have a life performance score, more holistic view?  Not just how you slept or your HRV, but looking  **49:03**at the whole picture of things. So really, life  network becomes a health tracking concierge team.**49:11**Ben Greenfield: I'm doing it right now,   by the way, Caleb, I'm wearing the Life Network  branded ultra human ring. I think you have one,  **49:17**too. Yeah, that's just like a sneak peek.  If people are watching the video, it's at  **49:22**bengreenfieldlife.com/applegate. Literally, blood  glucose, sleep, blood and biomarkers, activity,  **49:29**HRV, meditation sessions, breath work, coaching,  all built into one beautiful curated ring,  **49:36**right? That's available to our members. Rinse,  wash, and repeat that with your sauna and cold  **49:42**plunge package, with your home environmental  optimization package, etc. And it's kind of funny,  **49:47**Caleb, because, well, inside baseball for folks,  we have these really fun annual Ben Greenfield  **49:55**Life team retreats where we bring the whole team  together. And I crafted a vision two years ago  **50:02**at the team retreat in which I described how,  probably because I'm kind of like a content  **50:07**junkie and autodidact, I love to digest all this  information from the healthosphere and then turn   around and figure out a way to package  that and make it palatable for people.**50:17**Ben Greenfield: I architect, or I describe the   vision of like a podcast network, right? What if  we took what we've done with me and then we have,  **50:27**you know, we're generating revenue from ads,  but we've got the mommy endurance runner,  **50:34**and the swimmer, and the weightlifter, and  the biohacker, and the nutrition junkie, etc.,  **50:41**etc. And that was kind of sort of a cool idea. But  you really showed me that people don't need just a  **50:51**bunch more content, right? They need an actual  journey, and they need it structured in such  **50:57**a way that they actually have a plan to follow.  And yet, I actually am excited about the content  **51:05**part of the Life Network, too, because we have  taken this idea of podcasters, albeit ad free,  **51:13**hooray, within the Life Network. But tell me  about the idea of the actual content in there,  **51:18**especially like the podcast, AMA,  audio, video, learning type of stuff.**51:24**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, I think you hit on some really important   things here. One thing that I will highlight is  the thing that I'm the most excited about is,  **51:34**to your point, what do you do with all this  information? What our family needed, what I needed  **51:40**was movement. Constant movement. Forward, one step  at a time. Movement. In community. And then how do  **51:49**you take that information to make better informed  decisions about yourself, your health patterns,  **51:55**and then how can you contribute back into  the community? It's a beautiful flywheel,   actually. When we look at the content inside of  Life Network, it has a communal aspect to it.  **52:07**It's very dynamic. Instead of I'm reading this and  it's transactional, here's what I mean by that.**52:13**Caleb Applegate: You don't just jump into Life Network and you're   met with a bunch of different articles or some  of Ben's beautifully produced, epic masterclass  **52:24**course content. It is that, but it's so much more.  You mentioned shows, so we have a show, a weekly  **52:31**show called Triumph Weekly. This is the summary  of all things happening on the network. Everything  **52:38**from, we've got this VIP cooking event coming  up. Members only. There's 50 spots, this Friday.**52:46**Caleb Applegate: Make sure you don't forget   to join. Set your timer and be first in line.  We've got different core-contributing experts  **52:55**that we'll bring onto the Triumph Weekly Show. And  this is only like a 10 to 15 minutes show. Think   of it like a news anchor. Kind of like, here's all  things happening in the networks. Because it's a  **53:04**community. We want to celebrate wins. We want  to highlight achievements. Even if you didn't  **53:12**win a challenge, the fact that you participated,  you just got there is a win in and of itself. We  **53:21**will have challenges. We'll have different  shows. We have our new team, Team Triumph.**53:27**Ben Greenfield: RAW. We have RAW. Caleb Applegate: Right? Right. Go   ahead. You talk about RAW. This is your thing.**53:34**Ben Greenfield: Okay, I'll talk about   Rob. By the way, you were mentioning  Team Triumph. Many of you were on the  **53:39**ladder platform where you're following my  workouts. For those of you who missed that,   that's all going to be in Life Network now  as part of Team Triumph. So you get your  **53:50**daily workouts. I'll let Caleb and a little bit  tell you about the super slick interface. Like,   we have not messed around as far as the interface  goes and the usability. But part of this,  **54:00**too is like, I have thoughts sometimes when I'm  interviewing a guest, I only have so much time.**54:07**Ben Greenfield: Typically there's an hour to an hour and 15   minutes allotted for me to interview somebody. I  often keep my mouth shut when I disagree or when I  **54:17**want to argue back at a point. I often have things  I want to share post-show that are on my mind that  **54:24**I don't get a chance to share just cause there's  only so much time in the day. And a lot of times I   have things that I know I want the guests to talk  about that we just don't have time to get to. If  **54:33**I'm constantly interrupting them and arguing and  pushing back and sharing my own thoughts, etc.   You guys listen to the podcast, you probably hear  that I try not to talk over the guests too much.**54:43**Ben Greenfield: I also have things that   I want to talk about that go way beyond the twice  monthly Q&A's that I do like. Tons of tips from,  **54:53**gosh, the RAW episodes or everything from things  I'm doing for big toe and low back mobility, to  **55:00**new family and relationship habits, to different  ways I've been tapping into some of the appetite  **55:07**control stuff Caleb and I were talking about  earlier. I wanted an ad free platform where I  **55:14**could just talk to you like you and me having  a phone conversation where, hey, here's the. I   actually have some clients who will do this to me.  Like, they'll pay for a consultation and they'll  **55:23**lead off the consultation with. So, Ben, tell  me what you haven't been talking about in the   podcast. Tell me about the new things you've  discovered lately that are working for you.**55:32**Ben Greenfield: And basically, like my podcast and the Life   Network, the RAW show, is just that. It's quick,  it's edgy, it's me. It's like 30 minutes long,  **55:43**and it's literally just my chance to, to share  the stuff that I just don't get a chance to   share with you on this normal podcast feed, the  one you're listening to right now, in an ad free  **55:53**environment with the ability for you to be able  to interact with me within that environment.  **55:59**We're talking like AMA's forums, not just me,  but the other experts within the platform.  **56:04**I'm pretty excited about The RAW Podcast,  Caleb. It's been fun to record the first few. Caleb Applegate: I know, and you're crushing it. It's  **56:11**amazing because you're right. You have so much in  your orbit that's happening. All the crazy stuff  **56:17**that you get introduced to, the people that you  get to meet. I'm personally really excited about  **56:23**RAW with Ben Greenfield because it is, it's like  meeting Oz behind the curtain. So it's going to be  **56:29**super fun. So we've got RAW, we've got Triumph  Weekly. We've got several other shows that are  **56:36**already in production that will launch post-MVP of  Life Network, which we are hoping for-August ish.  **56:45**Around that timeline, we'll be doing a friends  and family release of that. We also, Team Triumph,  **56:52**like you mentioned. But this is the biggest thing  I think I'm the most excited about. We're going  **56:57**to be hosting debates. Do you want to talk for  a minute about this? Because this was really,  **57:03**this was your brainchild, and I know we've  kind of ideated together, but this is so cool.**57:10**Ben Greenfield: Okay, so this is something.   It's kind of like herding cats for me. But I've  got some really good debates that I'm going to be  **57:19**moderating. I got Sean Baker and Joel Green doing  carnivore versus omnivore. I have a doctor who  **57:26**hates stem cells debating a doctor who is super  into stem cells. I'm doing seed oils are bad  **57:33**versus seed oils are good. Just about, you know,  keto versus, you know, a high carb diet is better  **57:40**for the thyroid and for metabolism, anything  that you've heard on two different podcasts  **57:46**and you wish those people would just step into  like celebrity death match and go at each other.**57:52**Ben Greenfield: We're doing that within   the Life's Network. So basically juicy, juicy  debates on all the topics related to health,  **58:01**nutrition, fitness, biohacking. So  that's kind of another cool feature. Caleb Applegate: Yeah, 100%. And there is  **58:09**no other platform that's going to spotlight  conversation like this. Like X is great,  **58:16**but it's such a generalized public square. What  we're aiming to create here is a safe place  **58:25**around health, wellness and life optimization. So  conversation movements in community, we're here  **58:31**together. And then you and I, it doesn't just  stop there. We have really exciting plans to  **58:36**take this digital environment and kind of touch it  down locally, practically. So lots of cool stuff.**58:42**Caleb Applegate: We'll have our own   merchandise line that we're dropping with some  really epic, like Triumph t-shirts. We've got,  **58:49**I mean, the list goes on and on. I cannot wait  for the public to see this and experience it. The  **58:55**other thing that I want to highlight here, because  we've talked about, what are some of the cool  **59:00**things inside the Network. But one of the biggest  things that just to be transparent for a minute,  **59:09**that you and I have talked about is making  this accessible and affordable for everybody,  **59:15**right? Looking at the health and wellness space,  there's some just incredible products out there.  **59:21**Our desire, though, and I think our family's  desire, is to make sure that every person on  **59:29**the planet has access to this. Which means it  needs to be ultra affordable, right? We have  **59:37**operating costs, there's a baseline fee, but we've  put this thing at 16.99 a month. 16.99 a month.**59:44**Ben Greenfield: $16. Not 1,699. $16.99.**59:50**Caleb Applegate: That's exactly   right. Which is a game changer. It  doesn't exist in this space. Right?**59:56**Ben Greenfield: And look, by the way,   folks, I kind of like, let's not beat around  the bush. I own Ben Greenfield Life. It's how  **1:00:03**I feed my family. And when Caleb came to me, he's  like, we can do this at $16.99 a month. I'm like,  **1:00:10**oh, I don't know if we're going to actually  generate any meaningful revenue from that,  **1:00:18**but it's really about a lot of people in the  community. We want to build a massive tribe  **1:00:26**and a network. And sure there's things within  the Life Network. Like if you join for $16.99,  **1:00:32**you're not going to get like the $400 ring, right?  Like we make certain things accessible within  **1:00:37**the Life Network that you then get access to as a  member that you can't get unless you're a member.**1:00:42**Ben Greenfield: But all the content,   all the podcasts, all the debates, all the  community, all the Team Triumph workouts,  **1:00:49**all of the forums, everything is $16.99 a month.**1:00:55**Caleb Applegate: Yeah. It is your one-stop home,   your family, your community of like minded  individuals who are wanting the exact same  **1:01:05**thing. And that is to feel better and take that  desire and contribute back into the community.  **1:01:12**Pour back into the community. Somebody asked  me, or I've been asked several times recently,  **1:01:19**what are you expecting in terms of  users? And this is really important,   and I do feel compelled to share this. I've  said this over and over and over again. If we  **1:01:30**get 50 people out of the gate, I want to make  sure those 50 people are loved on so much and  **1:01:38**that they are experiencing real outcomes and feel  valued, that they want to tell 50 other people,  **1:01:46**so on and so forth. Our goal is to make this  boutique experience be the best, most world class  **1:01:55**experience on the planet, where you're not just  getting information, but you're getting engaged.**1:02:02**Ben Greenfield: Yeah. Yeah. And it's consolidated   and curated. I want to tell a story to drive  my point home. When I first started my podcast,  **1:02:10**this was like 17 years ago, right? This was before  River and Terran were born. That I was this,  **1:02:15**you know, freckle-faced personal trainer with a,  af you go back and find episode one, super high  **1:02:22**pitched voice, you know, skinny kids sitting in  the gym, opening up my age old computer with the  **1:02:32**computer camera turned on, talking into the camera  and like, thumbing through strength conditioning   journals and research. It was like 17 episodes  in when I interviewed my first official guest.**1:02:43**Ben Greenfield: I think it was Angela   Nath. Shout out to Angela. I think she  still listens to the show. Professional   cyclist and triathlete. There was maybe like  Gillian Michaels, Dave Asprey, Rob Wolf.  **1:02:56**I think Joe Rogan had a podcast. I don't remember,  but there were less than 100 podcasts, period.  **1:03:03**This is where you had to hard code your RSS feed  to Apple, wait two weeks for it to get accepted.**1:03:10**Ben Greenfield: If it was over something stupid,   like 100 megabytes, if any line of code was messed  up, your podcast would disappear. And this was  **1:03:20**like the dinosaur days of podcasting.  Well, kind of like blogging, you know,  **1:03:25**in the way that blogging transformed from the late  90s to the mid 2000s, you know, podcasting from  **1:03:31**the early 2000s to present day. Even if you just  talk about, like, health and fitness, podcasts  **1:03:37**has absolutely blown up. There are thousands  and thousands of podcasts which means a stream  **1:03:45**of information that you could listen to all day  long at 4x speed that you still would not be able  **1:03:52**to get through listening 7 days a week. So one of  the ways I think about the Life Network is what if  **1:04:00**it was all consolidated and curated, and all you  had to do was open the Life Network and just have  **1:04:05**those podcasts? Like, that's all the information  you need. We split it. Mind, body, spirit.**1:04:11**Ben Greenfield: You've got all the advice you need. I'm looking   over everything. I'm vetting all the guests,  I'm vetting all the experts. It's an ad free  **1:04:18**environment. Yeah, I mean, I don't want to shoot  myself in the foot here. You're still going to get   a lot of value out of this podcast that you're  listening to right now. But imagine if you were  **1:04:26**listening to this podcast. Let's say something  about, I don't know, haptic therapy for sleep.**1:04:32**Ben Greenfield: And you could actually go   within the Life Network and on the weekly AMA say,  hey Ben, how come you didn't ask the guests XYZ,  **1:04:39**and are you actually using ABC? Right. You can  actually interact with me within the Life Network  **1:04:45**in a much more personal way. And not just me,  but all these other experts and podcasters,   by the way, many of which you're going to be  familiar with when you join the Life Network.  **1:04:53**You're going to be blown away by the people we  have in there. But the way I think about it is   in an era of information overload, why not just  cut to the chase, get the stuff you want, and  **1:05:05**be supported by a community and experts who are  ensuring you get the most out of that information.**1:05:13**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, very well said. Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I agree. Simplicity, affordability,  **1:05:19**accessibility and just a world class experience  making it simple for people to understand  **1:05:26**what they need and what they  need to get in community.**1:05:32**Ben Greenfield: Caleb, I'm sure   people are wondering, and this is probably the  dumbest thing I've ever said on my podcast,  **1:05:39**but I don't remember what the  URL is for the Life Network. Caleb Applegate: Golifenetwork.com.  **1:05:44**We're not live yet. We're almost there. Ben Greenfield: We might be by the time this podcast comes out. Caleb Applegate: We might be. This  **1:05:51**is the beautiful thing. We're not promising  the future. We've built it. It's functional,  **1:05:56**it works. We have an active, pretty big dev  team working on this, doing an incredible job.  **1:06:02**Our entire team is filling this platform, this  network, with all sorts of incredible content,  **1:06:09**all the way from our coaching team, to our  partnerships team, to podcasts and all these  **1:06:14**new shows that we're creating again. Shout  out to our amazing team at Ben Greenfield  **1:06:19**Life. But everybody is incorporating into their  daily rhythms just content and contributions  **1:06:26**into the network. So this thing is going to be  rocking. I cannot wait to unveil it to the world.**1:06:32**Ben Greenfield: Yeah. And then a huge amount   of gratefulness to you, Caleb, because as you guys  listening and heard, we're talking like, you know,  **1:06:41**mineplex engine passages, taking all this  knowledge of how to make a slick user interface  **1:06:50**that's accessible, that's gamified, that's fun,  that doesn't break every hour while you're on it,  **1:06:56**and then marry that to the best of  the best. From health, from fitness,   from biohacking, from longevity, nutrition,  supplementation, etc. This is where, Caleb,  **1:07:05**you came in at a really clutch point, like being  able to actually pull this off from a technical  **1:07:13**standpoint. And for all you listening in, I know  we're getting a little long in the tooth here,   so we'll wrap up pretty soon, but you have to  see what this experience is like. And I mean,  **1:07:23**you heck, just like, you know, when  it's ready, go join. You don't,   you don't have to stay in if you don't want  to. Although I, I doubt that will be the case.**1:07:30**Ben Greenfield: But if you just want to surf around, see   what it looks like. Golifenetwork.com. And I mean,  yeah, I was even showing my wife and kids and  **1:07:38**they're like, wow, this is really professional.  This looks really good. And you don't see  **1:07:44**that a lot in the health and fitness space.  Something that's beautiful, but that also works.**1:07:50**Caleb Applegate: Yeah. I was on with one of our newly onboarded   core-contributing experts that probably so many  folks listening to the Ben Greenfield Life podcast  **1:08:02**would instantly recognize. And she, she was blown  away. And she said, and I quote, you have no idea  **1:08:11**how this is going to change lives. This is the  most beautiful platform I have ever seen in this  **1:08:18**space, end quote. And that was really encouraging  from a guy who doesn't come from the health and  **1:08:23**wellness space to be able to take my background,  kind of the culmination of everything that I've  **1:08:29**learned, intersect that with your expertise,  your relationships, all the knowledge base that  **1:08:36**you bring in and mash that all together, is really  exciting to see all of that come to life. So I am,  **1:08:44**man, I couldn't be more thrilled. Thank you  for the opportunity for believing in this   and allowing us this opportunity to release a  platform that will help change people's lives.**1:08:55**Ben Greenfield: Well, if you're listening in,   you know that I'm moving to Idaho. It just  so happens I'm moving about 20 minutes away  **1:09:02**from Caleb.

what I know about this disorder what's causing**0:05**it and what we're not doing to prevent it or treated it it will be recognized as the greatest tragedy in the history**0:10**of medicine Thomas CA freed is a professor of biology genetics and biochemistry who has dedicated the past**0:16**30 years Gathering scientific evidence on what could be the true origin and prevention of cancer cancer is getting**0:22**worse and there's no major advance in reducing death rates and I can speak to the reasons for that all major cancer**0:29**research PL think cancer is a genetic disease you believe otherwise it's not whether you believe it's what the data**0:34**tell us and the evidence is massive to support that cancer is a metabolic disorder and the problem is we're doing**0:40**everything we possibly can in our lifestyle to induce it the scientific evidence is there like for example we**0:46**know that cancer was extremely rare in African tribes that were living according to the traditional ways but**0:52**when modern lifestyle entered into their societies cancer out of control we even did a study on THS we know that wolves**0:58**in the wild don't die from cancer but cancer is the number one killer of domestic dogs why it's because of our**1:05**lifestyle issues and a lot of us are doing things without the knowledge that it would put us at risk but with**1:10**metabolic therapy you can use it as both a prevention and a treatment and we're seeing more and more of terminal cancer**1:15**patients outliving their predictabilities because of this and let me tell you one thing and remember it if you do metabolic therapy you can**1:22**actually reduce risk for cancer you can take away the fear and when you say metabolic therapy tell me what those**1:27**things are number one before this episode starts I have a**1:32**small favor to ask from you two months ago 74% of people that watched this channel didn't subscribe we're now down**1:38**to 69% my goal is 50% so if you've ever**1:44**liked any of the videos we've posted if you like this channel can you do me a quick favor and hit the Subscribe button it helps this channel more than you know**1:50**and the bigger the channel gets as you've seen the bigger the guests get thank you and enjoy this**1:58**episode Professor C if someone walks up to you on the street and they're you know they know nothing  <br>**What Would Dr Seyfried Say He Does?2:03**about science and they know nothing about medicine Etc and they asked you what do you do and why do you do it how would you respond I'm a professor of**2:10**biology at Boston College so uh in that role I spent a lot of my time working**2:16**with undergraduates and graduate students in training them to be scientific literate in in various**2:23**aspects of biology the research program that we have at the University is also**2:29**Focus fed on understanding uh how to manage cancer better how it originates**2:35**and how to prevent it how much of a problem is cancer globally what are the  <br>**How Much Of A Problem Is Cancer Globally?2:40**sort of headline statistics on the macro view of cancer for someone that really doesn't know yeah well it's getting**2:46**worse uh I can't say there it's in the millions I I I know precisely what's**2:52**going on in this country because the American Cancer Society uh every year uh**2:57**distributes the data on on cancer um we have almost two million new cases**3:04**diagnosed per year in the United States and we have 1,700 people a day**3:10**dying from cancer in in the United States which comes to about 70 people**3:15**per hour in the United States now when I went to China I looked at some numbers**3:22**there and it was 8,000 people a day are dying from cancer obviously the population is so much**3:28**larger and uh I don't know what it is in the UK I mean we'd have to go to their cancer**3:34**Registries but but what we do know is that it's supposed to be a lot worse by**3:39**2050 than it is today so there seems to be no reduction in death suffering for**3:45**this disease and I I can speak to the the reasons for that but right now I**3:51**would say it's a global uh epidemic of cancer it's not it's not getting better it's getting worse more people are dying**3:57**from it there's no major advance in in reducing death rates so it's a great**4:03**tragedy so um and when we when we understand what's causing it and what**4:08**we're not doing to prevent it or treat it it'll it'll be recognized as the singular greatest tragedy in the history**4:14**of of medicine worldwide when it when when they come to know what I know about this disorder and then they realize what**4:21**we've been doing in in in in in a misdirected way it will be recognized as**4:26**the greatest tragedy in the history of medicine what Tye types of cancer are people dying from what is the most  <br>**What Types Of Cancer Are People Dying From?4:32**popular types of cancer for men and women well it's always been lung cancer pretty much for men and women uh lung**4:38**cancer has always been the number one but but we have pancreatic breast cancer colon cancer these are all on the rise**4:45**colon cancer is on the rise pancreatic cancer is on the rise in this country I I I I can't speak for other countries**4:52**they may dare very slightly due to diet lifestyle issues but lung cancer has always been recognized as as the number**5:00**one cancer how many people in the United States then based on the statistics would develop cancer well it seems to  <br>**How Many People Will Develop Cancer?5:07**increase every year so it's kind of a moving Target it doesn't seem to go down**5:13**you know what it is today I don't know but what I do know is the numbers of people that are dying each day because**5:19**the um American Cancer Society comes out with I think it's 612,000**5:25**people uh will die this year 2024 uh from cancer**5:30**in this year so divide it by 365 and it comes out to just about 1,700 people a**5:36**day divide that number by 24 and you get about 70 people an hour based on the**5:41**numbers provided to us from the American Cancer Society when they say we've made**5:47**major advances in man in cancer incidences right so in the 1990s they**5:53**instituted the uh anti-smoking campaigns all right so today if you read they say**5:59**we have reduced cancer deaths by 30 31 or 32% wow that sounds really impressive**6:06**so what they do is they take the number this is what the national the American Cancer Society has done and published in**6:12**their papers okay if we didn't stop smoking in the 90s and everybody**6:18**continued to smoke the trajectory would be very very high because we stopped**6:23**smoking or this it's we have 33% lower death than if we didn't stop smoking but**6:30**the trajectory is continuing to increase maybe not as steep as it would have been had we continued to smoke so it's it was**6:36**clearly a prevention it had nothing to do with a a treatment it had to do with prevention that was giving the the the**6:43**oh we've made major advances in in reducing cancer death rate yeah because people sto smoking for the mo for many**6:49**many people more people would have died had they not smoked so we have um people**6:55**that are not not real people we're just looking at what would have happened if if we didn't stop smoking what are the  <br>**Where Does Cancer Rank In The Probabilities Of Taking My Life?7:02**leading causes of death worldwide in terms of diseases is is I I hear that**7:07**heart disease is number one I think that's heart disease is number one uh cancer is number two okay and there are**7:15**many different types of cancer right there's hundreds of different forms of cancer if you look under the electron**7:21**microscope or a correction even a light micro this is how most cancers are diagnosed by by light**7:27**microscopy uh you look under the microscope and you see a bunch of cells that are dysmorphic in the way they look**7:33**and then they all have genetic defects and all this kind of stuff but they all have one thing in common they depend on**7:39**a on a fermentation energy without oxygen so all cancers are a singular type of disease it's just that they**7:46**happen in different tissues but when you look at the underlying problem they're all very very similar they can't live uh**7:51**without a fermentation which means energy without oxygen so that's the common pathophysiological problem in all**7:58**cancers whether it's a colon brain breast bladder skin uh lung we we've**8:04**looked at all these cancers and they're all they're all essentially using the same mechanism to to grow out of control**8:11**so what is that F fermentation you mentioned fermentation is energy without oxy what does that mean uh we breathe  <br>**What Is The Fermentation Process?8:17**air and we uh exhale CO2 and water vapor and those are the waste products of the food that we eat we break everything is**8:24**broken down and combusted in our mitochondria of the cell and the waste products are Co 2 and water Vapors those**8:31**are the waste products but if you and I were to stop breathing for any**8:36**particular time period uh uh our bodies would fill up with uh lactic acid and**8:42**succinic acid like if we were to have a heart attack or when somebody has a heart attack um they don't die instantly**8:49**uh if if they if they're there without for five or seven minutes without oxygen they they may die because the brain dies**8:55**but if you can get the heart to beat again and get oxygen back in the system you can come alive again but when we**9:01**have that massive Interruption of oxygen into our body um the cells fall back on**9:08**an ancient they up they immediately turn on these ancient Pathways to get energy**9:14**without oxygen for a short period of time and that's the sugar glucose which**9:19**is already in our bloodstream from the food we eat and the amino acid glutamine which is a high amino acid in our**9:26**bloodstreams highest level of amino acid is the glutamine these two fuels are now**9:32**burned for energy obtain energy without oxygen there's no there's a these**9:37**Pathways upregulate and you can get ATP which is energy to keep you alive for a short period of time but your**9:43**bloodstream is filling up with the waste products called lactic acid and succinic acid lactic acid is coming from glucose**9:51**to sugar and succinic acid is coming from the amino acid glutamine and they build up and that tells you you're**9:57**fermenting you're getting energy without oxygen because you're not breathing very simple you're not breathing but I'm Not**10:02**Dead Yet now of course if you don't get it for very long you die it's just that**10:07**now the other way you can stop uh oxygenation in our bodies quickly is**10:13**with the poison cyanide so if we God forbid we were to take cyanide we'd be**10:18**both dead within within a minute we just just because our bodies are completely shut down of energy from oxygen now**10:26**here's the cancer cell the cancer cell lives in in can live in in cyanide**10:32**cyanide does not kill a tumor okay War a warberg showed this a long time ago and we've also shown the same thing in our**10:39**lab others have shown this the interesting thing is when you look at cancer cells even in the presence of**10:44**oxygen even in oxygen they're throwing out lactic acid and succinic acid what**10:49**does that mean that means the en the organ organel inside the cell that**10:55**generates energy is not efficient it's inefficient and the cells are using**11:00**ancient fermentation and when I say ancient fermentation you have to realize the Earth is 4 and a half billion years**11:06**old um the organisms that existed on our planet uh two and a half billion years**11:12**ago were all fermenters there was no oxygen in the atmosphere till the photosynthetic bacteria started making**11:18**oxygen they were living cells they had no oxygen and they were growing like**11:23**crazy unregulated growth just unreg what's going on here and they would die**11:28**as soon as the mble fuels were dissipated as they gobbled up everything they would just die so they lived as**11:34**long as they could reproduce and have fermentation fuels the cancer cell in our body is doing nothing than falling**11:40**back on these ancient fermentation Pathways that become accelerated up regulated in the tumor cell because the**11:48**efficiency of the energy coming from the mitochondria is now uh depleted it's**11:53**defective in many different ways so this is very clear and this happens in lung cancer colon canc we've looked at all**12:00**the major Cancers and we found out these common defects are seen in all the cancers so they're all very similar in**12:06**their metabolism they're very different in what they look like under the microscope lung doesn't look like colon doesn't look like brain um they're very**12:13**different genetically they're all different from each other but they're all common in a in a dependency on this  <br>**How Have You Arrived At This Conclusion?12:19**ancient pathway of energy metabolism can you take me back you mentioned a guy called Walberg there yeah can you take**12:26**me back on the journey that the scientific community or at least you have been on to arrive at the conclusion**12:31**that the central sort of causal Factor at least an indication of a causal factor of cancer lies in this shift in**12:38**Energy Systems where did this understanding start in in research well it started with Oto warberg for sure uh**12:44**in the 1920s uh the other linkage before I tell you what OT warberg did because I**12:50**was like everybody else I thought cancer was a genetic disease and and I heard about warberg didn't really know what**12:56**what he was talking about or invested any time thinking about what he said but**13:01**Linda nebling was a PhD nursing student at Case Western Reserve University and**13:07**in Ohio and she took these two little hopeless kids brain cancer we call**13:12**hopeless cases when they have no um predictability of long-term survival and**13:18**she gave them a ketogenic diet to lower blood sugar and she was able to rescue**13:24**these kids one one one eventually died the other one was lost to followup and she said it her strategy was based on**13:30**what OT warberg had said about glucose and cancer so then I said warberg I said who the hell what let me go back and**13:37**check out who this guy was and what he did because I was seeing similar things in the in the mouse with that drug it**13:42**was lowering glucose and and we were sh shrinking these tumor cells and we published a paper uh the first one of**13:49**the first ever papers linking that how high your blood sugar is determines how fast your tumor will grow in the mice**13:55**and now how this been replicated in all human cancers the higher your blood sugar the faster the tumor grows the**14:01**lower the blood sugar the slower the tumor grows undeniable for all different human Mouse cancers wow so warberg had**14:09**said this a long time ago back in the 1920s he he was taking slices of all**14:14**kinds of human and rat mouse tumors and slicing them up and he noticed something really strange about these um cancers**14:22**they take in less oxygen compared to the normal tissue from which they came wow**14:27**so they're kind of like oxygen deprived and they were throwing out this lactic acid waste product that he was that he**14:33**was saying and they were taking in so much more glucose than the normal so the normal cells take in just a little bit**14:39**of glucose and they can make tremendous energy from a tiny amount this guy was taking in huge amounts of glucose but**14:45**not fully metabolizing it to CO2 and water but dumping it out as lactic acid**14:51**which is a a breakdown product of glucose that is not fully metabolized in the cell wow he said this is**14:58**unbelievable and then he did all kinds of tissue I looked at his data was unbelievable he was cutting humans mice**15:04**rats and seeing the same thing over and over again and uh he was saying the**15:09**origin of cancer has to do with something in the ability of the mitochondrian the organel to generate**15:16**efficient energy from oxygen so the sorry the mitochondria is the part of the cell that creates energy it's the**15:22**part of the cell that creates energy through oxidative phosphorilation which is burning energy using oxygen okay okay**15:30**so it's like an engine it's an engine a very highly efficient engine that this is an organel you have to realize we**15:37**have the cell yeah and we have a nucleus that every everybody knows about this nucleus and then we have all these**15:42**little organel in there we have lomes and we have the mitochondrian which is like a spaghetti Network inside the cell**15:50**they fuse it's actually a second living it's a second living organism inside our cells and to simplify what they do the**15:57**mitochondria they convert oxygen and glucose into energy yes and they combust**16:02**uh energy uh they they take the foods that we eat have carbon hydrogen bonds**16:07**okay and we break those down inside our mitochondria and we and we and we when we break those bonds down we create a a**16:14**hydrogen gradient and we dissipate that gradient through an impeller mechanism that generates energy like crazy it's**16:21**unbelievable very efficient highly efficient but the cancer cell has corruption in that system but it doesn't**16:27**happen overnight as warberg said if you break that system too acutely and too fast the cell will die it doesn't have**16:34**the so you have to have two things to get from oxidative phosphorilation to uh**16:40**energy with with with minimal oxygen fermentation sorry just to keep it simple from a normal cell to a cancer**16:46**cell from a normal cell to a cancer cell doesn't happen overnight okay it's a chronic damage to the ability of of that  <br>**Why Do Cancers Grow So Rapidly?16:53**organel inside the cell to generate efficient energy okay so all we have to**16:59**know with cancer is that they're how are they growing so rapidly why are they going out of control how come it's so**17:04**hard to kill them because as long as you have those fermentable fuels that drive**17:10**this ancient fermentation pathway um they will continue to grow they're very hard to kill and the fermenting fuels**17:17**are glucose and and glutamine glutamine yeah okay so here let's let me tell you**17:22**in a nut are are you ready brace yourself are you ready I'm ready are you braced are you braced sufficiently bra**17:28**sufficient he's sufficiently braced okay so uh a solution to the cancer problem**17:35**to manage cancer without toxicity is to simultaneously restrict the two fuels**17:42**that are needed to drive this disregulated growth while transitioning the whole body off to a fuel that the**17:49**tumor cells can't use which is fatty acids and Ketone bodies so when we take**17:55**the cancer patients or the mice we put them into a calorie restriction lowering**18:00**the blood sugar uh that I said is one half of the two fuels you can lower that down really really low and then we use**18:08**specific drugs to Target the glutamine and together we can selectively restrict**18:14**the two fuels while we transition the whole body over to to ketones we as a**18:20**species evolved to be in nutritional ketosis for the the majority of our existence as a as a species like one and**18:26**a half million years for for centuries and centuries thousands and thousands of years our species you and me our**18:34**ancestors were always in a state of nutritional ketosis because there was very few carbohydrates in the**18:40**environment for them to be consuming right so the cancer cell the body you and I could if we stopped eating and we**18:46**took a low carbohydrate diet and just did water only fasting we would get into nutritional ketosis where the normal**18:53**cells our brain our kidneys our heart can be burning these Ketone bodies**18:58**because they have a good mitochondria and they can burn these fuels effectively the tumor cells have a bad mitochondria they can't burn those fuels**19:05**they're dependent on glucose and glutamine we can replace glucose and glutamine with Ketone bodies in the normal cells of our so we selectively**19:12**marginalize these tumor cells slowly over time uh we they slowly start to Die  <br>**What Are Ketones?19:18**the blood vessels disappear and the body comes in and dissolves them so for someone that has never heard the term**19:24**keto before ketosis or ketones in a simple way what are KET ketones ketones**19:31**are water soluble breakdown products of fatty acids okay they're beta hydroxy beate acetoacetate these are small**19:38**molecules that are water soluble the liver throws them out like crazy kidney a little bit but mostly liver so as I**19:45**told you earlier when we don't eat um you you get anxious mainly because**19:52**our brains are addicted to glucose it's like cocaine and nicotine and whatever**19:57**you start getting all antsy haven't eaten anything you know uh what's going on um so you then once the body realizes**20:04**you ain't going to eat anything we have to start mobilizing out of our fat resources and the fats uh go into the**20:10**bloodstream as triglycerides which are three fatty acids attached to a glycerol**20:16**backbone they go to the liver the liver chops them up and puts out these little water soluble Ketone bodies that the**20:24**name Ketone body is kind of a weird thing from biochemistry but but they're called Ketone bodies um and they can**20:31**supply the brain with energy the heart with energy and not only that they're a super fuel it's unbelievable that**20:38**mitochondria Burns these ketones okay but they ener remember I was talking about how energy efficient the**20:43**mitochondria become when they burn ketones they become even more energy efficient it's unbelievable how you you**20:49**they don't need as much oxygen to generate more en that's why they my colleagues called and some of the greats**20:56**in the bio in the biochemistry field called them super super fuel because you**21:01**can get more energy bang for buck burning a ketone body than you can burning a pyruvate coming from glucose**21:07**or even a fatty acid uh and the biochemistry for that is is interesting**21:12**but but the bottom line is when you transition away from these fuels to ke we don't forget we evolved our our**21:19**ancestors were always in a state of ketosis you get into that state by consuming very few carbohydrates and  <br>**What Can We Learn About Cancer From Our Ancestors?21:25**having a lot of energy and this is the way our ancestors were so what can we learn from our ancestors about cancer**21:31**how prevalent was cancer um when we look back at our ancestors if they were often in a state of ketosis yeah well um it's**21:39**hard to determine uh from skeletal records uh but I think we can look at U**21:45**um modern pop modern man who live according to their traditional ways um**21:52**you know uh Albert schwitzer the Great humanitarian physician went to Africa and looked at Africans that were living**21:58**according to the traditional ways and he said one of the weirdest things they don't have cancer it was like what what**22:04**uh cancer was extremely rare in Africans in ints living in in the in the areas**22:12**British when they came you know in in in looking at the health conditions of folks that lived in the Arctic Circle**22:18**cancer was not there they had other things but they didn't have cancer um Aboriginal folks so it seems as though**22:25**uh our living we we can't go back 50,000 years ago because we don't have people**22:30**to examine but we have people to examine today and that was one of the things schwitzer and several other Physicians**22:36**from Europe would go to Africa and they would look at these some of these tribes that were traditional and they would say**22:42**whoa what's going on with these Africans how come they don't have but when modern diet lifestyle entered into their**22:48**societies cancer out of control what about what about our the primate cousins**22:54**yeah um there's never been a documented uh case a breast cancer in a female**23:00**chimpanzee uh and they're 98% similar to us in Gene and protein sequence uh you**23:05**know what's going on with that um monkeys uh they don't generally form cancer they're eating they're not eating**23:12**what we eat okay don't forget we did not evolve to eat pork pies and Dunkin**23:19**Donuts jelly fil donnuts and pizzas we did not our ancestors did not eat this right we were killing and eating Animals**23:26**As I said we ate everything that walked crawled flew or swam on this planet became part of our diet um we did not**23:33**have Donuts on every corner delicate essin on every corner our we evolved over this period of time just like our**23:40**primate ancestors uh the animals chimps and gorillas and things that you see in**23:46**the zoos are fed their natural diets as if they were living in in their habitat**23:51**their natural habitat whether it was in South America Africa or wherever it was were're not throwing in jelly donuts**23:57**every day and pizza pie into the chimpanzee pen and as a matter of fact I even went to the zoo down down here in**24:04**in Boston Franklin Park Zoo and also at the San Diego Zoo I said how come how**24:10**come you guys don't give these guys run down and get a big pizza for these for these animals oh no it' be animal**24:16**cruelty their systems aren't Geared for this well neither are**24:22**we we have an obesity epidemic we have all these different chronic diseases why**24:27**we didn't have to eat all this crap that we're eating today so what I've told many people in these podcasts is that**24:33**our food science and technology and our society's technology has evolved so much  <br>**What Role Does Exercise Play In Fighting These Diseases?24:39**faster than our biology can you explain to me in simple terms the role the exercises playing in staving of cancer**24:46**well exercise lowers blood sugar you know you and and also lowers glutamine so uh the two fuels that are driving uh**24:53**now we can't completely remove glutamine by exercise that's for sure um but we my**24:58**my late good friend George kahill published some papers on showing how exercise could actually lower uh**25:04**glutamine availability so it's a it's a little bit of a push but you're also when you exercise you're burning and**25:10**you're not eating a lot of carbs your mitochondria burning ketones and the oxygenation from all the exercise is**25:16**keeping those mitochondria super healthy at their highest level of Energy Efficiency so exercise you're building**25:23**muscle as well aren't you yeah you're building well you can build muscle but you're certainly getting aerobic exercise to oxygen is coming in and**25:30**you're burning ketones which I already told you is a super fuel so your body is super healthy uh these bodies from the**25:37**Paleolithic period these men were jacked there was no obesity in these people they had tremendous energy they're**25:43**they're not dying from uh the things that are killing us they're dying from injuries and infections when you  <br>**What Lifestyle Choices Are Causing The Cancer To Develop?25:49**described this slow and gradual shift in the cell as it moves to this sort of**25:55**ancient system it sounded very gradual so in my I thought okay so does that mean that the cancer is a gradual**26:03**process that is kind of building up in me or isn't building up in Me based on the lifestyle decisions I'm making and**26:09**my environmental factors right now like I'm trying to say does is does**26:15**cancer start slowly years before you you you know you find it is a gradual process but it can**26:22**be impacted by several provocative Agents from the from the micro environment um lack of exercise okay so**26:30**we're not exercising nearly as much as our Paleolithic ancestors Bar None right**26:35**we have massive amounts of processed carbs in our diets we have a lot of emotional stress uh um mental emotional**26:44**stress that's impacting negatively on on our biology um we we have lack of sleep**26:52**sleep uh a lot of us because we we have stresses you you have to have when you put all of these impact act ful things**26:58**together in one person you can put yourself at risk for Cancer all of which**27:04**will damage and reduce the efficiency of mitochondria and also the joy of living**27:11**uh having friends and friendships and and this kind of thing reduces stress in a lot of different ways makes people**27:17**enjoy getting up and and having a a nice day rather than being depressed or or these kinds of things um you put all all**27:24**this together and you put yourself in a a diet and lifestyle that puts you at risk for damage to oxidative**27:31**phosphorilation and the transition from one form of energy to a fermentation energy and what I'm trying to understand**27:36**is that a it's a grad a gradual transition you have to be able to do that and how long does it take for a**27:43**colon a group of cells in a in a in a crypt of your colon to transition from**27:48**one stage to another you have to be constantly under stress those cells and that organ now why somebody gets colon**27:55**cancer another person gets breast cancer another person gets black cancer and some person gets a brain cancer and all these different kinds of cancers what**28:01**whatever happened the process was dis was causing a gradual disruption of**28:07**oxidative phosphorilation oxidative respiration and a and a gradual transition to a fermentation like in the**28:14**brain the neurons rarely if ever get cancer but the gal cells that support neurons they are usually the source of**28:21**the origin of cancer in the brain for those kinds of cells and you can look at different cells and some are more or**28:27**less prone and why this guy got lung cancer from from smoking cigarettes this guy got bladder cancer from smoking**28:33**cigarettes how did it all start it all started from a population of cells in one of those organs having an a chronic**28:41**not instant a chronic Interruption of oxidative energy followed by an upregulation of this fermentation energy**28:48**so really we need to be thinking about all the things that have caused dysfunction in the mitochondria absolutely I want to get a list of the**28:54**key things that are associated with causing this dysfunction okay carcinogens okay so carcinogens and you**29:00**know there's many asbesto there's all kinds of chemicals in the environment you hear about this oh there's a whole**29:05**list of carcinogens we and they put them on the on the labels on different chemicals they say carcinogenic  <br>**Is Cancer Genetic?29:11**potential and whatever you have what are the types of things that are C cogenic that most people don't realize oh well**29:17**now we're talking about microplastics we're talking about um is that in part what causes breast cancer cuz I always**29:25**think about dooen with breast cancer and and the stuff that we're kind of lathering onto our arm yeah well the the**29:30**one that was was most interesting was the talcum powder one how does talcum powder would cause ovarian cancer okay**29:37**it's taken up into the urogenital tract and it forms a fosi in in a part of the**29:42**ovarian tissue what's a fosi a Locus like a collection of material a fosi is**29:49**a an area where say talum materials would be accumulating and that leads to a**29:56**inflammatory um area of the body and our immune**30:01**system comes in to see what's going on our immune system is a healing machine and they see something that's not not**30:08**normal normally they would clean it up but they throw grow cyto kindes and growth factors on there leading to**30:14**disregulated damage to mitochondria and disregulated it and then you get this tumor that starts so if I get a talcum**30:21**powed uh granule or whatever and it goes into my body my body then tries to**30:26**attack it to sort of out and in doing so it creates inflammation which leads to damage to mitochondria in a particular**30:32**group of cells near that fosi okay and this this is applicable to I guess a lot of different Nano particles and yeah and**30:39**microplastics are this now they're looking at this but then we have chemical carcinogens tetrahydrochloride there's all kinds of other things that**30:45**can actually damage arsenics and and these kinds of chemicals um urethane uh**30:52**anything that could chronically damage uh a mitochondrian forcing over time for**30:58**ing it to upregulate the fermentation energy without oxygen isn't this most things I'm trying to figure out what I**31:04**how to live my life yeah well that's what that that's why it was called the oncogenic Paradox but but you can you  <br>**How Do We Keep Our Mitochondria Healthy?31:09**can avoid that that's why I'm saying if you can keep your mitochondria healthy how exercise and reduce uh consumption**31:17**of Highly processed carbohydrates do I need to be avoiding these microplastics as well you you know the problem with**31:23**microplastics they're very ubiquitous we're not really sure uh we just now becoming aware of it nobody really knew**31:29**that before um look it up it's but it could it could cause U small fosi in**31:35**different populations of cells but you know it's very hard to really chronically damage mitochondria**31:41**mitochondria a tough organel the problem is we are chronically abuse it without realizing what we need to do to keep it**31:47**healthy so even if you are exposed to chemical carcinogens even if you are exposed to all these things but you're**31:53**keeping your body as healthy as you possibly can you could possibly delay or**31:58**even prevent the damage to the mitochondria even though you have the even though you are being exposed to**32:04**this so it's a it's actually in your hands um you can actually reduce**32:10**risk for cancer by knowing what keeps your mitochondria healthy vigorous**32:15**exercise uh fasting water only fasting um you know it's very hard some but**32:21**sometimes we when we were putting mice on calorie restriction it was hard to get them to get tumors their body was so**32:26**healthy this was shown Years Ago by by a couple of scientists in mice using mice**32:32**with that developed a lot of breast cancer if you put them on a calorie restricted diet the incidence was way**32:37**way down so cancer is very preventable it's a very preventable uh disorder it's  <br>**Is Cancer Genetic?32:42**just that we're doing everything we possibly can induce it in our diet lifestyle a lot of big institutions**32:49**believe that cancer is a genetic problem**32:54**um you believe otherwise the evidence is striking I mean to believe it's not**33:00**whether you believe it's what the data tell us okay so according to the somatic mutation theory of cancers mutations in**33:07**the nucleus lead to disregulated cell growth that's the sematic mutation theory in the mitochondrial metabolic**33:13**Theory it's a transition from oxidative phosphorilation to to a fermentation metabolism inside inside the cell um the**33:22**mutations are largely irrelevant what do you mean by that when the mitochondria become defective they throw out**33:29**Ros reactive oxygen species that are carcinogenic and mutogenic W what does**33:36**that mean causing mutations so a lot of the mutations that we see in the nucleus of the tumor cell that is the subject of**33:42**the sematic mutation Theory are Downstream effects of the dysfunction of the mitochondria so the mitochondria is**33:49**causing a downstream effect which are mutations which according to the sematic mutation Theory are the cause of the**33:54**disregulated cell growth let me tell you why that's absolutely untrue there's some cancer cells growing**34:00**out of control have no mutations and normally not discuss how can that be that's a a challenge to the theory if**34:07**the theory says that all cancers have mutations and you have some cancers that have no mutations and they're growing out of control that should say who bell**34:14**ring one uh then they the the sematic mutation uh people people who think this**34:20**said oh okay we have we have a problem here not all mutations are the ones that cause the disregulated only some and we**34:27**have a name for those some that's called driver mut okay now it's a nice term because some of those mutations are**34:32**called passengers they don't really do anything but the drivers are the ones that lead to the disregulated cell**34:37**growth so we should be focusing our attention on these driver mutations new evidence from the recent scientific**34:43**literature can you believe this they're taking tissue normal tissues from patients different organs and things**34:49**like this from not patients from normal people no cancer perfectly like yourself here we would take tissue from you and**34:55**say oh my Christ look at the you got driver mutation in your esophagus and your different parts of your body you**35:00**got driver but you don't have a tumor what's going on with that how you explain that these driver mutations are**35:05**causing disregulated cell growth when we have thousands of driver mutations that are there that are not causing**35:11**disregulated cell growth oh okay that's a another problem the biggest devastating information against the**35:18**somatic mutation theory is if you take the nucleus from a tumor cell cleanly take it out of the tumor cell and you**35:24**have another normal cell here you take the nor the nucleus out of the normal cell and you put the tumor cell into**35:30**that cytoplasm you get regulated growth no disregulated growth but if I have the normal cell and have a tumor cell take**35:37**the tumor nucleus out of there and take the normal nucleus and put it into the tumor cytoplasm which contains**35:43**mitochondri defective mitoch disregulated cell Dr this has been seen over and over and over again so just to**35:48**summarize that so if you take the tumor nucleus side of the cell and put it into a a normal healthy cell yes um**35:55**everything's fine everything is fine but if you take take healthy cell nucleus and put it into a tumor cell you still**36:00**have the same dis regulated cell growth tumor growth so which means that it's not the nucleus absolutely it's**36:06**something else it's something else and that's the mitochondria and I told you then you have cancer cells with no mutations and then you have driver**36:12**mutations and normal cells that never become cancer you put all those things together and you have to be uh a**36:19**hopeless ideologue to think that cancer is a genetic disease um it's a silent**36:26**assumption in the field that cancer is a genetic every textbook of biology cell biology and bio cancer is a genetic  <br>**Why Haven't Opinions Changed Based On Dr Seyfried's Evidence?36:31**disease why hasn't people's opinions changed despite the evidence that you**36:37**present it's a very difficult thing it goes back to um when you have one Theory**36:44**replacing another theory it's called Paradigm Paradigm shifts and in all in**36:49**history of science Paradigm shifts have been met with great great resistance uh the clear the clearest one was the**36:56**Kernan Revolution when uh for eight 1,800 years astronomers in**37:04**our early Astron astronomers thought the Earth was immovable in the center of the solar system for 1,000 this was Claudius**37:12**TMI Aristotle and the Bible and all these Earth is immovable and the Sun and**37:18**the Moon and the planets all revolve around the earth 1,800 years even**37:24**Cernic's uh was working with these mathematical formulations this kep was being constantly confused until he said**37:31**what happens if we put the sun in the center of the solar system and consider the Earth as simply another planet that**37:37**would revolve oh all of a sudden things started to make sense and gardano Bruno**37:44**uh a theologian was put to death for suggesting that cernus was right um**37:50**there was a tremendous resistance on the part of the Roman Catholic Church at that time and this is the same thing**37:56**that happened when when and um Lewis Pastor said the germs the germs rather than bad air are the cause of disease so**38:04**uh and when Darwin Wallace theory of evolution came it's not special creation it's it's natural selection that that**38:10**can explain this these were massive Paradigm changes in the history of Science and what we're seeing today is**38:17**the same thing the mitochondria is the center of the problem with cancer not the nucleus the mitochondria it's a**38:23**mitochondrial metabolic disease and once you realize that we're going to drop these death rates massively in a very a  <br>**If We Adopt This Mindset, What Will Happen To Cancer Statistics?38:31**number of years for sure so if we take two paths then if we realize that that the mitochondria is the center of the**38:37**dysfunction and ultimately disease in the cell yes if we go that down that path what impact do you think that will**38:43**have on the canc cancer statistics over the coming years it'll drop it massively**38:48**okay I'm not going to say we'll get rid of cancer completely uh but here's the thing we may never get rid of it but we**38:54**can learn to live with it and keep it at Bay if if we know how to if we know that it can't survive without these two fuels**39:00**and you can do a diet and lifestyle that can restrict the availability of those two fuels and keep your mitochondria as**39:06**healthy as you possibly can what if we don't go down that path what you think then you're going to be right one out of two people are going to be having cancer**39:13**that your statistics are going to be U AB absolutely correct is there anybody that you believe because you know when  <br>**Are The Current Cures Working?39:19**we talk about these subjects often we think of like big Farmer and the incentives and money and follow the money and you'll figure out why people**39:25**don't want change are is any of that sort of conspiratorial thinking correct in your view are they I**39:31**don't know if that's conspiracy I don't like conspiracy terms that's absurds I like what are the facts of what we're**39:38**looking at but do you see a resistance from Big farmer to entertain this point of view um what do you think what do you**39:45**think I mean do you think this is I mean you're making a lot of not you but but people in these in that those Industries**39:51**the hospital industry is making enormous amounts of money they're rewarding we get uh7 billion a year for cancer**39:58**research in the in the in in the National Cancer Institute awarding gr many many not all many grants to look at**40:05**for gene mutations and all this kind of stuff um and we have drugs that are extremely expensive based on a sematic**40:11**mutation theory of cancer that are basically not dropping the death rate as I said we got while we're talking here**40:17**we're g to have 140 people dead uh from cancer uh 1,700 people years getting**40:22**worse and worse um with as you said we're always running for raising money for cancer research uh where's all that**40:29**money going what are you doing with all that money no accountability and then when you look at the scientific advisory committee of all these societies that**40:36**you're running for they all think published papers on cancer as a genetic disease it's too hard for the field to**40:43**accept at this point um it's it's too traumatic at what I'm saying it's too**40:50**disruptive to a a massive industry uh at this time they will come to gradually**40:56**adjust to what I'm saying it's just a matter of time because we cannot continue this trajectory it's immoral**41:02**what we're doing to some of these people I read a St that said the global incidence of early onset cancer**41:07**increased by roughly 80% between 1990 yeah and 2019 that's in the bmj oncology**41:16**um early onset of cancer is basically patients under the age of 50 and and when I think about this you know growing up in the UK whenever there's a a fun**41:23**run a charity race a marathon whatever it might be cancer research get the money yeah and to hear that you know**41:29**there's been so much money invested in cancer research over the last couple of decades but there's been an increase of**41:34**80% in early onset cancer in the same period for me I'm like this research doesn't appear to be**41:41**do being very effective well as I said you got to find what people don't do is they never ask where's the research go**41:48**what kind of research what what are you doing what is the research it's the theory that drives the the impetus to do  <br>**The Current Technologies Used To Prevent Cancer41:54**research now a lot of great stuff has been done on you know keeping people alive that**41:59**suffer from cancers right because if you think about the probability of dying from a cancer I'm I'm assuming that has gone**42:06**down yeah uh to some extent it has you know we call there's two ways of looking it's called Uh progression free survival**42:12**and overall survival uh these are the terminologies that are used in the clinical world of cancer uh uh and they**42:19**represent the approval of drugs through the Food and Drug Administration if you have a drug that**42:25**improves a progression free survival uh progression free means it looks like**42:30**the drug is working on the tumor um because you know the tumor you can see it it gets bigger and bigger and more**42:36**lethal and more lethal and and if I see it not growing nearly as much uh I say**42:41**wow look at the it's it's slowing the what we call traditional progression okay it's called progression free**42:47**survival and then you have overall survival so you have two ways to approve**42:53**drugs mostly for cancer right how does it work on aggression free survival and**42:58**how does it work on overall survival well they stop looking at overall survival now somebody's going to bark**43:04**and say well you know bottom line is mostly progression free which means that the patients it looks like the tumor is**43:09**being effectively managed but they live only a couple of months longer than they would have if they didn't use this drug**43:16**so therefore it's approved and and and um that as opposed to overall survival**43:22**you know you're only living a two okay You' lived two and a half extra months the tumor looked like it was manage**43:27**pretty well but your overall survival is is this much but you you didn't see the tumor growing uh we're going to improve**43:34**that drug so a lot of the new drugs that we're giving do a really good job at progression free survival but they do a**43:40**horrible job in keeping people alive much longer which ultimately is what you want to do you want overall survival let**43:46**me give you an example avastin uh bismid this this is an immoral drug that should never be used on people it was blocked**43:53**because it caused colon perforations in women with breast cancer they still use it on brain cancer and when you so the**44:00**in the tumor you got a A tumor you can see it with PET Imaging and you can not so much pet MRI and Cat Scan you can see**44:06**it there and it's looking there okay uh you can see it now you give the patient a vaston and uh which is this um**44:15**anti-angiogenic drug it's supposed to stop the abnormal blood vessels right they think that the angiogenesis blood**44:22**vessels is is driving the disregulated growth it's the fermentation that's driving the just regulated growth by the**44:28**way so all of a sudden you give the the tumor kind of disappears it doesn't look like it whoa patient gets all excited**44:35**The Physician looks and says look at that look at the looks like you're doing well what it does the EV what the drug**44:41**does is it causes the tumors permeate your enti your entire brain just like spreading it through**44:48**your whole brain you don't live any longer uh but you had this progression free look at the tumor so the patient**44:54**gets excited because it looks like the tumor's disa appearing with this very expensive drug but what it does is it**45:00**almost guarantees that that patient will not survive because you spread the tumor cells through the whole brain so um this**45:07**is why I call it an immoral kind of a thing but chemotherapy and sort of these radiation therapies they have proven to**45:13**keep people alive who otherwise would have died in some cases they it can and**45:19**and that's another thing we have to look at we have and I I work heavily in brain tumors and G blastomas and things like**45:24**that when you irradiate somebody's brain uh who has one of these tumors you free up massive amounts of glucose and**45:30**glutamine in the micro environment and if you look at the survival when we did survival looked at survival curves for**45:35**gleo blast throughout the world oh it's un you can't even design experiments so consistent how fast people will die it's**45:42**like all the different hospitals have the same survival same survival what are you doing well we do chemo we do**45:48**surgical debulking uh T olomide and we give steroids which raise blood sugar and we irradiate we irradiate we**45:54**irradiate everybody's dead so um not everybody but you know fiveyear survival**46:00**is is very very low 10e survival is almost zero um but if you go if you got**46:05**a breast cancer or if you got this is brain cancer I'm talking about this is freeing up now yes if you have a**46:11**circumscribed tumor and it's not anywhere else you can come in with a radiation or surgical procedure and cure**46:18**essentially cure that patient but if you have any level of spread or anything like this um that that person now and**46:26**also if you're taking a toxic poison into your body like Red Devil docar rubison they call it Red Devil your P**46:32**turns red everything turns red what is that is that chemotherapy yes is a chemotherapy to kill a small group of cells um or maybe a little bit of a**46:40**spread but your your hair falls out your body gets brutalized uh by this and then**46:46**if you survive the cancer and many people do we have millions and millions of cancer survivers on this planet but**46:52**many many folks in that group suffer from the adverse effects of being p poisoned or irradiated or surgically**46:58**mutilated I mean they have to change their whole and often times the cancer comes back or they die from**47:04**cardiovascular disease or they die from secondary adverse effects of being brutalized uh with medieval I call it**47:11**medieval approaches to this are you kidding me what they're doing to cancer patients so when we do metabolic therapy**47:19**we we shrink the tumor down for sure then the surgeon can come in and he sees**47:24**it smaller fewer blood vessels because of the metab therapy and we can take out a greater amount uh of of this and then**47:30**we transition back to prevent this tumor from recurring metabolic therapy can be**47:35**used to not only prevent the cancer but can also be used to treat the cancer now let me tell you go most hospitals**47:42**suppose people say well you know I really want to do things to prevent cancer can I do standard of care before I have a tumor what do you mean you want**47:50**to go into a uh major Cancer Clinic and have toxic doxorubicin and radiation to**47:55**your body just in the event that you might get a cancer this is absurd but yet when you have cancer that's what they do to you right but with metabolic**48:03**therapy you can use it as both a prevention and a treatment it's just that with a treatment we bring in some more drugs to Target the glutamine we**48:09**don't do that on the prevention side on the I was just looking at some stats as you were speaking around the fiveyear**48:14**survival rates of a variety of different cancers um over time and it does appear**48:20**that survival rates of these cancers from breast cancer to prostate cancer to lung cancer to leukemias um and various**48:26**melanomas has improved since the 1970s so the 1970s to the 1990s to the**48:33**2010s there's been an improvement in the survival rate um which I guess is a credit to the research that's been done**48:40**um what you're saying is that this the treatments we have still today are horrific yeah and the and the survivals**48:46**are not that much greater it's not like you're getting massively longer survivals yeah I mean and I have to I I**48:52**have to preface that these stats might not be right because this is AI we're dealing with here but the there's a 5%**48:57**for example with breast cancer between the 1990s and 2010 there's just a 5% difference in overall survival in**49:04**overall survival okay so your survival your overall survival is two and a half to three months greater I I don't  <br>**How Do We Prevent Cancer?49:10**actually have those stats in no but that's that's that's the the evidence the papers that we're looking at so so**49:15**how do we prevent prevent this then I'm 32 years old now so I want to make sure that I**49:23**live my life in such a way that I limit my chance of cancer one of the things I always reflect on is the fact that many**49:28**of the people that I know that have got cancer breast cancer or other forms of cancer appear to be remarkably healthy**49:33**yeah always at the beginning there there not always but many times the person comes in gee I**49:39**just was diagnosed with cancer I didn't know I had it I didn't feel bad I didn't and then all of a sudden you get treated and they look like death warmed over but**49:45**I'm saying like how can how can healthy people be getting cancer if there's this sort of central well because you I as I**49:50**said are the the the the and we're seeing this I'm seeing it in my own I'm getting more and more emails from young**49:57**people in their 30s uh late 20s 30s early 40s like with colon cancer breast cancer and all these kinds of things but**50:04**look at our diet and lifestyle situation today those those things that I'm talking about lack of exercise a lot of**50:10**stress poor sleep bad food all of this kind of stuff impacting parts of our**50:15**bodies so what do we do about it though know about it and then and then what do we do so I know that's personal choice**50:21**I'm not here to take pieces and and jelly donuts off the market for sure or breakfast here I love that stuff too but**50:27**the qu the question is I don't eat it every day and I know if I do it'll kill**50:34**me so so yeah skipping meals water only fat occasionally there's a lot of things**50:41**you can do to keep your mitochondria healthy okay so tell me what those things are I just exercise you look like**50:46**you're a pretty healthy guy yeah I go to I go to the gym you don't look morbidly obese to me not not yet not yet well**50:51**that's important because you don't ever want it yet we would't be in America too long so my chan well and listen it's not**50:56**just the United States we were kind of like the first ones to plow that field but it's starting to spread everywhere I think in China they have the most 200**51:03**million obese people in China now so should I be on a keto diet then here's what we did okay uh we developed the  <br>**Should I Be On A Keto Diet?51:10**glucose Ketone index calculator at Boston College all right my students and I because we were trying to uh work with**51:17**cancer patients blood sugar and ketones um independently of each other we had a**51:23**ketone meter and we had a blood glucose meter so we were monitoring ketones by itself and glucose by itself and we**51:30**worked with a very nice woman U from American who lived in East France who since passed away from a brain stem**51:37**tumor was very very difficult we kept her alive very long but eventually we didn't know what we need what we know**51:42**now but she got into an argument for a handicapped parking spot with her neighbor upstairs and her blood sug and**51:50**blood sugar went through the roof she ran upstairs and she took her blood blood sugar and she says oh my God the tumor is going to grow I said what's**51:55**your ketones and she says oh it's still 2 and a half Miller well that's still pretty high usually it's very very low**52:01**it's very high so my students and I we said you know this is too traumatic to try to measure these two independently**52:08**why don't we make a singular number divide the glucose in molar in the blood by the Ketone and Molar in the blood now**52:15**you get this number that's much more stable and it allows the cancer patient to know that if I keep this Zone in 2.0**52:22**and below my tumor cells aren't going to be able to grow very fast I did this for the brain cancer right now it's being**52:28**used for all Cancers and now it's being used for guys like yourself who just want to stay healthy and because what it**52:35**is essentially is a quantitative determination if you're in the Paleolithic zone or not oh so if I'm at**52:40**2.0 like my friend Dominic the austino he's always down in these zones he's living the P he's a Paleolithic man**52:47**living in modern society what's a Paleolithic man that's how our ancestors were during the Paleolithic period okay**52:53**so he's got the right balance of glucose and ketones in his blood like we did when we were hunting mammoths and and**52:58**Buffalos and these kinds of things when we were hunter gatherers in the thousands of years of our existence as a**53:05**species tens of thousands of years he is in that zone is he in keto yeah well**53:10**that's that's what the low gki is that means you're at a level of Keto now yes**53:15**he doesn't eat a lot of carbohydrates in his diets eats leafy vegetables and a lot of meat and and this kind of thing**53:21**sparingly on fruits uh like grapefruits we learned from the epilepsy field great fruits provide a tremendous amount of**53:28**vitamin C with don't and do not Spike glucose that's that's very interesting so you can have uh certain fruits that**53:34**can keep you in this metabolic zone of P I call it the Paleolithic Zone which is the way we evolve with there was no**53:40**cancer in our in our existence when people hear that they might start jumping on the paleo diet I don't even know what the not a paleo diet it's it's**53:47**diets that are low in carbohydrates okay okay um Mediterranean diets like people**53:52**say to me at told God what should I eat should I eat this and that normally you would eat foods that have very low low**53:57**glycemic index which means the speed with which glucose is released like a banana very high in glycemic index you**54:04**eat a banana your blood sugar immediately spikes many fruits are like that um but you want you want foods that**54:11**keep a low steady uh uh gki now I built that uh calculator for brain cancer**54:19**patients initially then we realize it's powerful for all cancers uh we put the cancer patient in the low glucose Ketone**54:25**index we get them down in there then we come in with the glutamine targeting drugs to to kind of polish off these**54:31**tumors or put them in even a more dormant state but now we finding all these young kid like yourself all these**54:36**30 20 year olds what's your gki I mean they're out to weightlifting and they're looking at their G they don't have**54:42**cancer they're just excited to see they they can get into this Paleolithic Zone by themselves and that yes that will**54:48**prevent cancer because you can't get cancer if your mitochondria healthy if if you're in a Paleolithic Zone where our ancestors rarely have ever got**54:54**cancer then you're you're back in this oh you me to tell me I can't eat this and I can't eat that what does it do to  <br>**Dr Seyfried's Dog Study54:59**your gki oh Mak it go up well don't eat that so you did a study on dogs a dog**55:05**with a tumor yes can you tell me about that study it was a woman came to me and this is what I say does you don't have**55:12**to have a a PhD in Biochemistry to understand what some of the things this**55:18**woman had no degree whatsoever she just heard the uh about what we did to these mice and she did the same thing to her**55:25**dog um it was a pitbull and at aged seven years old it had big mast cell**55:30**tumor on its lip so she listened to my YouTube video over and over she said to me I just kept listening then he says I**55:37**I got I I I I got some raw chicken she says dogs wolves evolved to eat chickens**55:43**so she got some uh chicken Cho chopped up the chicken she cut the calories of she found some dog food calculator to**55:50**how much calories the dog was getting she cut the calories the dog look lost only 5% of its body weight**55:56**she got uh pollic fish oil raw eggs and cut all the calories everything was all**56:03**natural for this dog um and all of a sudden we have the pictures you can see them in the P if you saw the picture big**56:09**big tumor on its lip that the the veterinarians said this dog is gonna to survive you have to give him chemo and**56:15**radiation and surgery and all this kind of stuff and it's going to cost a lot of money the dog's gonna have diarrhea it's going to be you know she didn't want any**56:21**part of that so she said well let's just try this metabolic thing and and she**56:27**kept all the records and the pictures and what she did and how much she gave the dog and all this so I was able to get all that information from her um put**56:35**my friend Lauren Lauren Nations who was a veterinarian uh on the paper because I said what biology guy at Boston College**56:42**is telling you how to manage cancer in a dog we got to have some veterinarian on here to validate to make sure he's there**56:47**and he looked at the pictures and we looked at all the thing and disappeared so what happened was the dog eventually**56:53**died of heart disease at 15 and a 12 years years of age so essentially that's the only when people say well metabolic**57:01**therapy cure cancer I I say metabolic therapy is never considered a cure for**57:06**cancer it's an effective non-toxic management for cancer but in the case of that dog it appeared to work to cure the**57:12**dog but that's the only one I'll say oh he's gonna say cure cannot that dog happened to get he died from old age  <br>**Human Cases Of People That Have Followed Your Research57:17**from a heart heart attack and we did it with a brain tumor guy Pablo Kelly who just passed away unfortunately from a**57:23**from a surgical um his his uh had a a major cerebral uh Hemorrhage after his**57:29**surgery from Devon England you know Devon England that's where I'm from are you from Devon yeah oh wow well Pablo**57:35**was there he just passed away fortunately we've talking to him the day before he passed away Pablo Pablo Kelly**57:41**so he was from Devon England had a gleo blastoma which is the worst of the worst uh they said and he's all over your your**57:48**newspapers there and Devon he was always sending me articles from England um man**57:53**rejects standard of care so he he had this gleo blastoma and they took the**57:58**tissue out which is brain cancer yeah brain the worst of the brain cancers you know uh they took the tumor out and they**58:04**said oh you it's in inoperable inoperable and uh but if you do**58:10**radiation in chemo uh we you might live nine maybe 12 months at the most well**58:15**Pablo came from a family of like we don't dabble and and this kind of medicine we're more holistic kind of**58:22**people so he emailed me this was in 2014 um and said I want to try this metabolic**58:29**thing so he rejected uh chemo and radiation and they said it wasn't**58:35**surgically capable of being completely removed anyway so he did this I I gave**58:41**him the information that I give to everybody and this was way back before we knew a lot of what we now know and uh**58:48**I said this poor guy he sees another one and they said you're going to be dead they they brow beat him they try to force him to put the radiation mask on**58:55**they hacked his beard off uh all this kind of stuff and he just jumped up he said I can't do this stuff so um he**59:01**didn't take any steroids he didn't take any any radiation he didn't take any chemo he just did the metabolic therapy**59:07**and he's on English telev or things with all of his paleo diet which actually a low very low carbohydrate diet he had**59:13**the avocados there he had the fish oil there he had this different stuff two three years go by he emails me**59:20**I said gez Pablo I thought you would have been dead you're still alive what's going on with that**59:27**so so he calls me up and he says you know um I went in for a CAT scan the**59:32**other day doctors are like still surprised that he's alive and they said this tumor is is still there and it's**59:38**growing and they think they can cut it out now so he was three years on on just**59:43**metabolic approach he didn't take any glutamine Inhibitors which was really remarkable so so anyway he asked me and**59:50**I have I have physician friends that a radiologist that can look at it and we measured it when it was first first**59:57**diagnosed in 2014 and then we saw it did become a little bigger so and the now**1:00:02**the surgeon said I think I can get it looks more more receptable here it was inoperable now it becomes receptable so**1:00:08**he took it out and um Pablo recovered really well and uh the surgeon says I**1:00:14**think I got it all wow so so and and Pablo is measuring his glucose Ketone**1:00:19**index with our Keo monitor so I had every day sometimes two and three five years of data on Pablo can you believe**1:00:26**this so so anyway Pablo thinks he's cured because the the surgeon all of a**1:00:33**sudden he goes back to his kind of weak weak ways and you can see the his gki**1:00:38**goes up and all of a sudden the tumor starts to show up again puts the fear of God back into him goes back on a more**1:00:44**restrict condition another three years goes by and this time the tumor is growing slowly very slow don't forget**1:00:51**gleo blastomas kill you very quickly um with standard of care you can barely get out of at his age if you can get two**1:00:57**years you're doing you're doing really good so anyway now he's three and he's got six years out and he says you know**1:01:04**um uh it's still back you know he I got to go in so it first so this is second debul first debul goes off gets back on**1:01:12**another second debulking another three years goes by he has a third debulking can you believe this the debulking**1:01:17**debulking is the cutting the tumor out it's the removal surgical removal of this tumor but he's never had radiation**1:01:23**or chemo or any of the kinds of stamp what we call standards of care so for**1:01:28**and now um he he has uh I talked to him a couple of weeks ago and uh he was**1:01:35**doing he was doing really really good he had the the third removal and we were laughing with myself and Dr duer and my**1:01:42**associates he says yeah can you imagine um uh I've had now three operations on a**1:01:49**previously inoperable tumor so we were saying wow they got**1:01:55**that wrong didn't they follow and they kept wanting to irradiate him and do all this stuff and he said no no going to keep doing this and so we were speaking**1:02:03**to him and and uh he's out 10 years the tumor was was diagnosed in in in August**1:02:10**2014 and he passed away August uh 2024 from they try to go in and get the**1:02:17**last bit of tumor out of his brain he came out of we got him uh we talked to him a thumbs up smiling talking like**1:02:23**crazy six hours later cereal hemr and need dies so uh he didn't die from the cancer he died from the a surgical**1:02:31**problem with the surgery so he was a you talk about long-term survivors uh you**1:02:36**rarely survive two years with a gleo blastoma the fact that he was out 10 years and if he hadn't had that last bit**1:02:42**of surgery the guy would have still been alive because he was talking like you and I are talking this is a guy who has a a terminal so I said to Pablo I said**1:02:50**you could outlive me I I says I said we're all terminal to some extent right we're never all of us aren't going to**1:02:55**live to I said sure he was a young guy he was only 20 22 or 23 when he was diagnosed he was in his 30s now when he**1:03:01**passed away 10 years so he's 33 34 years old and and I said you know I could be**1:03:07**dead before you and we were laughing and we had a good time and then next thing I know I got an email from his wife he**1:03:12**said Pablo is is on on on on brain dead and something I said what**1:03:17**the hell happened what happened to this poor guy and it wasn't the cancer so um**1:03:23**who how know I don't know what how long you would have lived how many more things but what I'm saying oh he's an**1:03:29**anecdote well listen if I had a drug that did what what metabolic therapy did and I could get more people like Pablo**1:03:35**are you kidding me they'd be run running all over the world and when you say metabolic therapy you mean the  <br>**What Is Metabolic Therapy?1:03:40**combination of the calorie restrictive yeah ketogenic approach yes avoiding well first of all you're avoiding you're**1:03:47**avoiding things that are going to kill you the radiation is going to kill you for the for many people not all people**1:03:52**okay everybody say well well listen you can you can look at go have people look at the data themselves for crying out loud and you can see how long you're**1:03:58**going to live he didn't do what they what they grab everybody in what did he do specifically he didn't take radiation**1:04:03**or chemo yeah and he brought his glucose Ketone index down to the 2.0 Zone and**1:04:08**kept it kept it low and he took some supplements and a few things here and there but he wasn't really targeting the**1:04:15**glutamine like we thought it with like we we thought we we found now certain parasite medications will be effective**1:04:20**in targeting glutamine so we're doing all non-toxic strategies to manage cancer you don't have to be brutalized**1:04:26**by the system if you know what to do and how to do it the problem the problem is most of the poor oncologists never heard**1:04:32**of what I'm talking the stuff I'm telling you right now they never heard of it the risk is someone gets cancer that's listening to this or someone has  <br>**What Should Someone That Has Cancer And Is Listening To This Do?1:04:37**cancer that that's listening to this I mean statistically there's a lot of people listening to this that have cancer right now and they're speaking to**1:04:43**their doctor and their doctor is saying chemotherapy radiation therapy etc etc gluc glucose has nothing to do with**1:04:50**tumor eat whatever you want yeah and so what' you say to those people who are they've just got a DI agnosis um and**1:04:57**their doctors are saying right listen this is pretty bad severe we're going to suggest that you take chemotherapy yeah**1:05:03**you're not telling them not to take chemotherapy are you I'm not telling them that and what we found what we found is that when you are in uh**1:05:10**nutritional ketosis with a glucose keto index of 2.0 or below my colleagues that**1:05:15**we work with in Istanbul Turkey were able to show that chemotherapies at much lower dosages can be even more**1:05:22**therapeutically powerful when you're in nutritional ketosis so you don't have to get rid of a lot of these different**1:05:27**procedures that we have today I'm just saying radiation for brain cancer I'm not saying radiation for lung or some of**1:05:33**the other cancers okay because if you can if you can shrink those tumors down and make them very weak and vulnerable a**1:05:39**surgical procedure a radiation procedure even lowd dose chemo could come in and even immunotherapy if you if you took a**1:05:46**big tumor and shrunk it down to a small small nub and it's resistant to a lot of the things they all have to share**1:05:53**something in common for them to survive have this this path that might be an immunotherapy could come in because**1:05:59**they're going to Target whatever all of them have together and you could possibly get rid of it that way I'm thinking of a friend of mine that um has**1:06:06**been diagnosed with brain cancer brain tumor and this is one of the most you**1:06:11**know it's a it's a woman in her 40s or 50s trying to keep her Anonymous as possible um who is just the most fit**1:06:20**athletic person that I I know eats amazingly well is literally known for**1:06:26**exercise um and I'd go how how is it possible that someone who I would probably say is fitter than I am if you**1:06:31**looked at their sort of metabolic Health has got a severe brain tumor well it it**1:06:37**they can stay healthy for uh and I'm not saying everybody who has and it depends**1:06:42**on what kind of a tumor it is as well is it a gly blastoma alod dendral Goma you know Panet there's a lot of different**1:06:49**kinds of tumors that want to know that it's it's not growing necessarily but it's big and it's in the brain and**1:06:54**they're going to remove for surgical operation well if they can what we always suggest for the brain cancer if you do metabolic therapy up**1:07:01**front and I've had uh surgeons tell me this uh you can shrink it down because**1:07:07**one of the um one it's angry it's an angry thing right and you can see some**1:07:12**slight Invasion if you can shrink that down so that it's more circumscribed now the surgeon can look at and go oh my God**1:07:18**we we know uh many many scientific Publications the more you can debolt that's called the removal of the tumor**1:07:25**debulking the longer the patient will survive the evidence is massive to support that but you know with a lot of**1:07:31**these brain tumors you don't get it all and there's always some little piece that remains and when you irradiate you**1:07:36**explode the ability to the cells to ferment energy and it's very hard to kill them but but if you can get the**1:07:43**majority of it out and then transition the patient back into a metabolic State keeping the pressure on those tumor**1:07:49**cells you can remain healthy like Pablo I mean these these guys can and when you found in mice is that when ketogenic  <br>**Keto Plus Hyperbaric Oxygen Study1:07:54**diet was combined with a hyperbaric oxygen therapy the average survival time was increased by roughly 80% yeah even**1:08:01**more sometimes now but what okay so why do we hyper do hyperbaric oxygen right**1:08:07**that's the question what's going on with hyperbaric oxygen why is this like a good thing it works best when the**1:08:13**patient and the mouse is in nutritional ketosis okay so look we have a tumor we**1:08:20**iriate that tumor how does the radiation kill the tumor cells it hits oxygen blows up and it causes a reactive R and**1:08:28**it's like a a stepping on a landmine it blows the tumor up right so um cancer**1:08:35**cells protect themselves even though they make a lot of rust they all they're this close to death anyway but they have**1:08:41**a very powerful antioxidant system and interestingly enough that besides**1:08:47**causing the disregulated growth the glucose and the glutamine also protect**1:08:52**them to some extent from the Ross that they're making and can you believe this the Ross r r reactive oxygen species**1:09:01**that are carcinogenic and mutogenic so they're they destroy our our our proteins lipids and and nucleic acids**1:09:09**they're disruptive molecules so radiation will cause a Ross in the micro environment Ros that'll blow up and kill**1:09:16**cells normal and and tumor cells but but if you want to selectively kill tumor cells you with Ross Not to cause your**1:09:24**hair to fall out your gums to bleed and all this crazy stuff you take the patient you put him in nutritional**1:09:30**ketosis and you say he's l a low gki then you go into hyperbaric oxygen which**1:09:35**dissolves oxygen directly into your blood now it's better than just breathing 100% oxygen because you can**1:09:40**actually dissolve oxygen in the bloodstream then you're taking away the two fuels that protect the tumor and**1:09:47**you're giving it internal Ross which kills the tumor internally only to the tumor cell not to your surrounding**1:09:53**tissues so you're killing selectively killing tumor cells without collateral damage to your to the rest of your body**1:09:59**as a matter of fact the rest of your cells are getting super healthy because they're burning ketones in pure oxygen**1:10:04**unbelievable how do we measure if our um can you believe this I can't even believe I'm saying this stuff**1:10:10**myself you really got to know the biochemistry and you have to know the physiology of your own body and you have**1:10:15**to understand evolutionary biology most people just aren't that intelligent including me it's not**1:10:21**intelligence most people most people kind of want things sort of simple principles that they can**1:10:27**live by and Implement and also quick and easy yeah of course okay they don't want to do what I'm talking about it because**1:10:33**it might be or the other thing let me tell you one thing and remember it if you do metabolic therapy success rides**1:10:39**heavily on your shoulders you're not sitting there like some Pawn with mannequin some guy's poison and radiating you to to make metabolic**1:10:46**therapy work you are the one doing the gki you're the one in your it's your**1:10:51**soul it's your you're responsible for your existence on this planet you're G to put your your precious soul in the**1:10:57**hands of someone who has less of a knowledge about the the problem than than you might as an entrepreneur I'm**1:11:04**always looking for ways to connect and to create and that's why I decided to launch the conversation cards I turned**1:11:09**to Shopify who also sponsored this podcast and Shopify made it so easy to**1:11:15**set up an online store and reach all of you no matter

is in the description destion below**1:11:56**could you be predisposed genetically to cancer yeah that's what those germine mutations but you can manage that people  <br>**Can You Have A Pre-Disposition To Cancer?1:12:03**think you know my my grandmother had breast cancer my mother had breast cancer so yeah you know they live in a common environment too it's not like**1:12:09**you're like in order to prove that you you you and all the siblings would have to be raised in a different environment**1:12:15**different countries different Lifestyles and then see if you all got cancer at the same time under all these different conditions that's definitely genetic**1:12:21**that's like Huntington's disease tayac disease or these kinds of things they'll manifest regardless of the environment**1:12:27**so you saying to me that I should as a 32y old man that's cancer-free um God willing I think God touchwood um I  <br>**Should I Restrict What I Eat, To Stave Off Cancer?1:12:34**should calorie restrict myself to keep my mitochondria healthy and my**1:12:40**metabolism healthy now I should be in a in a sort of restri I say it's good to**1:12:46**visit the state our Paleolithic ancestors had no choice there wasn't a**1:12:51**doughnut shop on every corner there wasn't pizzas there were there weren't the kinds of Highly processed carbohydrate Foods available to them so**1:12:58**should I be fasting should I be doing keto I you know I don't want to tell you what you should or should not do I'm not a physician here I'm a scientist I study**1:13:06**what causes these things and I study how to manage them you have to read what I'm saying and you have to come to your own**1:13:12**decisions about how you want to conduct your life I've given you information what's your view on fasting fasting is a  <br>**What's Your View On Fasting?1:13:19**powerful uh way to get your body into nutritional ketosis but it ain't easy try doing it try you try doing it see**1:13:26**how how easy it it ain't easy right uh but that's why we developed this procedure where if you go um rather than**1:13:33**going cold turkey uh say well today I'm gonna have a big I'm G eat as much as I can and then tomorrow okay you can go**1:13:39**the I can it's the second third days when you start to really know what the hell is going on believe me I've tried**1:13:44**it it's It Ain't Easy that's why we developed uh a zero carb diet for 14 days 10 to 14 days just zero eat meat**1:13:52**fish chicken whatever you want but just don't eat any bread pasta this kind of thing on keto um how do we get into that  <br>**How Do I Get Into The Keto State?1:14:00**sort of ketosis state that people often talk about measure your glucose Ketone index how do do that with the the the**1:14:06**keto Mojo meter you can buy it from Amazon okay okay you can buy now don't forget they get a free Libra meter now**1:14:12**for the blood they're working on Ketone blood meters but it's not there yet right now the keto Mojo or some other**1:14:18**keto meters where you could take a prick your finger like a diabetic you take a glucose strip and you put it on the**1:14:23**blood and you put it into the machine it tells you what your glucose is squeeze your finger a little bit more take the Ketone strip touch it to the blood put**1:14:30**it in the meter it gives you the Ketone value push the button gki comes right up okay okay very simple everybody can buy**1:14:38**it from from Amazon get the meter buy the consumables uh and then they can test it this is what Pablo this is what**1:14:44**all the the cancer patients the ones who really want to get into metabolic ketosis I think I've tried keto before**1:14:49**and I say think because I didn't measure my my keto level I was assuming I did yeah no it's really people say well I**1:14:55**haven't eaten you know I'm in ketos how do you know well I blew into this thing and the bulb came out I peed on a strip it looked like it was ketosis they are**1:15:02**indirect measures the most accurate is the blood measure so um it's hard to stay in that state for most people right**1:15:09**this is one of the things because the Temptations in our society are so strong yeah I mean Paleolithic man had no**1:15:16**choice do you think he that was his State that's all he knew for thousands and thousands tens of thousand hundreds**1:15:21**of thousands of years that's all he knew he didn't say let me go down to get a big jelly fil donnut down at the at the**1:15:28**end of the the river there no there's none of that he had to live in that state now we have so many Temptations**1:15:34**all the things that we are biologically clear for when you see obesity that's**1:15:39**evolution in action they are the descendants of our long ancestors that**1:15:44**could hold on to energy so efficiently we were an energy starved species for**1:15:50**the majority of our existence on the planet so anything we ate would be very little we never pee out glucose glucose**1:15:56**is converted to fat and we store energy as fat so those guys are energy efficient human beings now all of a**1:16:04**sudden we find oursel with everything and that's Evolution and action man that we're just we're just you're allowing to**1:16:11**see the how we can store energy so efficiently because our ancestors liveed**1:16:17**through such um environmental forcing we had famines we had long TRS**1:16:23**we our body could store energy so efficiently because it wasn't we had to store what little we could get from the**1:16:29**environment now you've got you know 300 million Americans in this food environment where when when they walk out their front door they see the Dunkin**1:16:35**Donut they can lie in bed and order a Dunkin Donut to their front during 10 minutes you don't even have to unas the**1:16:40**car they hand it through the window yeah no energy no energy expenditure energy in so so you know giving them this**1:16:47**information might be fairly futile because the tempt well that's I'm not here to tell people again I'm not here**1:16:53**to tell people what they should or should not do I'm just here to explain like why do we have all this not mystery**1:16:59**it's all biological evolution you understand biological evolution almost everything that I'm talking about makes**1:17:04**perfect sense um and unfortunately that's not part of our scientific literacy anymore so we need what  <br>**Do We Need More Discipline?1:17:10**discipline discipline is important um discipline is important um you know**1:17:16**every major religion had had a point of fasting um to be whether you're Islamic**1:17:25**Judaism or whatever Catholicism Hinduism whatever I don't whatever they always**1:17:31**had some sort of fasting why why you do fasting because you want to purify your body you want to become closer to God**1:17:36**you want to you want to you want to feel in control uh and that's always part and**1:17:41**if you do it with prayer it's even better so uh there was a reason for doing all that and uh people realized**1:17:48**the Ancients uh knew this kind of thing but uh we don't do that anymore uh we**1:17:53**don't go 40 days without food like Jesus did in the deserts um but a human being**1:17:59**you could absolutely do that I I know because I can look at your weight I can look at your size and I can pretty much**1:18:04**tell you how long you can go with before you died and how do I know that because George Cahill a good friend late George**1:18:11**kale ran the D jlin diabetes center and he he he evaluated people that would**1:18:16**just could water only fasting on until until death and um and some of those**1:18:22**conon MA prison and things so he was able to know how much you could how long**1:18:29**you could go now what about um Angus barbar went 377 days uh without food  <br>**What Happens When You Fast?1:18:36**George Cahill would fast some of these obese people for for 250 300 days what**1:18:41**happens inside their body with with they're burning fat so what happens is you burn fat okay liver stores a lot of**1:18:47**of um bone store the minerals that you can get minerals from your bones you can get a lot of fat storage um vitamins are**1:18:55**stored in fat a lot of vitamin D outside of the weight loss what's going on in you know we said PE religious people**1:19:01**used to fast to get closer to God yeah which seems to me to point to some sort of cognitive change yes and that's from**1:19:07**burning ketones yeah burn when you burn K I said in the brain when your brain starts shifting to ketones your energy**1:19:13**uh the bang for the buck for each calorie that comes in from a ketone body increases the efficiency of oxidative**1:19:19**phosphorilation so you more focused massively and you know this is**1:19:25**why our ancestors with the way that if you're if you are dependent on killing**1:19:30**some animal uh for your survival and you are out on the hunt you are focused uh**1:19:37**because if you're not focused you're going to starve to death so every organ sense organ in our body is super is**1:19:44**super jacked when you're in these ketotic states so and these guys walking around with headphones listen you know**1:19:51**all this I mean this is like depriving ourselves of the natural ways uh of our ancestry don't forget we're not just you**1:19:58**and I are not just here over the last you know 100 300 400 years we are the descendants of members that are same as**1:20:05**us you know hundreds of thousands of years ago they were they just didn't have the technology that we have today**1:20:11**but if you could brought a Paleolithic man from say 500,000 years ago and you gave him a bunch of donuts and told a he**1:20:18**would die went to heaven you mean to tell me I don't have to go out and kill the elk anymore they're going to hand me the food right through the window of**1:20:23**course he's going to do that you go in the cave and you throw a bunch of jelly fil Donuts into a bunch of**1:20:29**Caven who been chewing on the half eaten rat or something you think they're not**1:20:34**going to eat those jelly donuts they have a some chimpanzees live with a family down in Florida I know some**1:20:41**YouTube thing The Chimps they're eating the food with the family and then they give jelly sandwiches to The Chimps**1:20:47**banging on the table you think they were going to go crazy chimpanzees loving the jelly sandwiches do you have kids  <br>**What Advice Would Dr Seyfried Give To His Kids?1:20:53**yes what advice would you give to your children if they're listening to this now about um how to prevent their chance**1:21:00**of getting sick from cancer or these other well they probably say well Dad how come you don't do a lot of the things first of all I'm not telling I**1:21:05**told you I don't tell anybody what to do or or how they do it I'm just telling you the science behind why why things**1:21:12**work um yeah my my my my my children my two sons and my um they're all very very**1:21:19**successful and uh they they said if we ever got cancer we would be doing your we would be doing metabolic therapy if**1:21:25**we were to ever get cancer and I said just keep you know exercise and and do what you can do the best you can in our**1:21:31**environment I mean don't get me wrong I'm eat I'm eating a jelly donut I'm drinking beer I'm drinking whiskey why**1:21:38**because I like it but I'm not going to be doing it all the time you know it's just it's just I'm not going to be**1:21:43**saying oh I'm going to eat pizza sure but I'm not going to be uh uh not doing it I do water I do intermittent fasting**1:21:50**I don't eat for 18 20 hours at a time I do a lot of exercise over at the university the gym and the facilities**1:21:57**that we have um but I but I understand and then if I were to get cancer I would**1:22:02**have to um bite the bullet and do what I'm do what I know works as much as it wouldn't be pleasurable but it would be**1:22:08**certainly a better alternative than being radiated and poisoned I'm telling you that if that has built your  <br>**Why Isn't Dr Seyfried Trying To Be Metabolically Perfect?1:22:14**conviction to the point that you're so convinced that the real issue is this sort of metabolic dysfunction**1:22:20**um why aren't you optimizing your life to be sort of metabolically perfect well because I live in the same Society you**1:22:26**do yeah okay and and fortunately yes our technology has improved uh**1:22:33**significantly um you know I'm not a monk I'm not going to be in some Monastery you know chanting something um I I I am**1:22:41**a member of the society just as you are and I enjoy the things that we have to offer us to make our lives a little bit**1:22:48**more pleasurable there's nothing like sitting down over a nice meal and having a discussion with some wine and enjoying**1:22:53**it and en jooy the moment but don't but not to be locked into that kind of uh**1:22:59**diet and lifestyle all the time uh puts you at risk there's an election going on  <br>**What Food Laws Would Dr Seyfried Introduce?1:23:05**in the United States at the moment Trump versus Camala Harris um if you won the**1:23:10**election and you became president of the United States and you had to introduce some regulations or some laws around**1:23:16**food and all of these kinds of things what would you do well I I think you**1:23:21**know you're were talking about a food industry you're talking about a multi-dimensional economy I I would not**1:23:29**again you don't want government to tell you what you should do you should make**1:23:35**the choices but you have to recognize are there are there choices and what are these choices right now we're not in and**1:23:41**we're not seeing or understanding uh how things harm people if if we have an**1:23:47**obesity epidemic and that would put you at risk for all these horrific chronic diseases why do they not know that we we**1:23:55**introduced some regulation in the UK regarding smoking so you can't smoke inside anymore well that's but do you see this your secondhand smoke can**1:24:02**impact negatively the person sitting next to you this uh uh obese person's**1:24:07**personal choice to be obese is not going to make you obese or sick so this is a different kind of a situation um it that**1:24:15**has to come from internal to the person and they have to be concerned with their own health what about drugs though like**1:24:20**cocaine is not legal so why can't they intervene to say you can't have Dunkin Donuts um because they're both you know**1:24:29**gonna harm the indivual I think you'd get a revolution if you can't eat a Dunkin Donut you were not going to get a revolution if you can't have**1:24:35**C you try take go down here in Brooklyn and take away all these Donuts from people you know you're going to see**1:24:42**they're going to go you know it's it's like it's personal choices I I I I like**1:24:47**Dunkin Donut I mean I like the coffee especially but um but you can go to donnut shop and get some of these**1:24:53**crawlers and jelly fills and Honey Dipped are you kidding me these things are delicious you ever get these blueberry muffins you tremble while you**1:24:59**eat some of this stuff you know it's and I'm not going to take that away from me but if I want one I'm not going to be oh every day I got to eat no I just don't**1:25:06**eat it I on the weekend I might get one and even sometimes two or three weeks months go by before I'll get one you**1:25:12**know but uh but when you get it man you enjoy it you really love it are you  <br>**Is Dr Seyfried Hopeful?1:25:18**hopeful I am very hopeful because PE when the science comes you can't**1:25:23**suppress the truth it's going to come out the evidence the scientific evidence is there I'm documenting this scientific**1:25:30**and it's based on the shoulders of OT warberg are you kidding me I mean this was a giant in the field of biochemistry**1:25:35**it's not like I made this stuff up I'm just extending what he has done to a new dimension and putting it into a**1:25:41**practical application which he had never done so it's just an extension of of of**1:25:46**the knowledge base o over this time why' you care so much why do I care so much**1:25:52**you know I'm not in it for the you know what I'm in it for I want to see the the scientific**1:25:59**principles substantiated if you know that you can keep these people alive at a higher**1:26:05**quality of life based on the knowledge of the science that's doing that that's gratification man it's gratification to**1:26:13**know that these if because because you arise on understanding the mechanism of the problem and if you say you know if**1:26:20**we do it the way we're writing a big treatment protocol as we speak it's review a really comprehensive treatment**1:26:26**protocol and we Institute that in the clinic and for G blastoma patients and these Advanced cancers they're not**1:26:32**they're not living a few extra months they're living several years longer why because you knew the science what's**1:26:39**wrong with that that's that's gratification you don't have to make a billion dollars on that all you have to**1:26:45**know is that all those folks are living longer because you understood the science that was put into practical application what's WR that's our our**1:26:53**research is supported by philanthropy and private foundations that money allows me to to to do these experiments**1:26:59**to test what I'm testing on pre-clinical models and then we translate it back into the clinic directly and we see like**1:27:06**Pablo Kelly he should have been done he should have been done years and years ago he lived all those years extra he's**1:27:12**had a wife and he's got kids he didn't have to have his sperm Frozen he didn't have to have any of that stuff done**1:27:18**what's wrong with that keep I'm seeing people that are should have been dead a long time ago and they're still alive**1:27:23**and they're saying I'm doing fine I get calls from people geez I thought that guy would have been a goner he's still**1:27:28**alive he's doing well I said that that keeps me going because it tells me that we're on the right path this is a**1:27:35**solvable problem this cancer this cancer can be dropped significantly you can**1:27:41**take away the fear people now put the put it on their shoulders I know what to do how to do it I'm going to follow this**1:27:46**will it work for everybody no well it will help a lot of people much more than what we have today but it's Paradigm**1:27:52**change massive paradigm change so uh they will come to know it's just a**1:27:58**matter of time I don't know how long it's going to take but I ain't going anywhere I'm continuing to do this I'm going to get better and better results**1:28:04**and we're going to keep pushing I published these case reports in the scientific literature let the scientific field uh make their decision on the**1:28:11**results from these papers and if you are to succeed what happens people improve  <br>**And What If You Are Successful?1:28:17**um what I'm not going to live forever so but I know that what I've done with with**1:28:23**following Auto warberg and cleaning up the misconceptions and misunderstanding of why he he was stalled when the field**1:28:29**ran off chasing jeans we got to bring bring it back on track it's a metabolic problem with metabolic U Solutions so**1:28:37**that will help a lot of people but it's also going to change a lot of way people are thinking about this but I I can tell**1:28:43**you they want to open clinics I get calls from from Asia Africa South America they want to open clinics people**1:28:50**are being brutalized by a system that's not working don't forget besides the terrible Financial tox the personal**1:28:57**physical toxicity people have gone bankrupt their marriages are falling apart because they can't pay for the**1:29:03**expensive drugs on these cancer things and they die and the bills are passed on to their level this is immoral stuff is  <br>**Are There Any Studies That Have Broken Dr Seyfried's Heart?1:29:10**there a particular case study that's broken your heart more than any others Trudy Dupont who originally let me we we**1:29:18**built a glucose Ketone index calculator on her Pablo is I'm still we're still**1:29:24**ated by Pablo's loss because Pablo was a a guy that I've known for 10 years**1:29:29**worked him through and then all of a sudden he gets a cerebral hem and dies he was our poster child for how long you could live with a gleo blastoma on**1:29:36**metabolic therapy but he didn't die from the cancer um yeah have there's some others that we wished they could have**1:29:43**lived a little bit longer uh with the appropriate help what I find is that sometimes within the family there's a**1:29:49**lot of the guy he's I really want to do what you're doing but my wife and kids saying I'm foolish to do that so it's**1:29:56**it's still a very we're in a very early stage of this we haven't really worked**1:30:01**it out into a an effective standard yet it will come so people and the other**1:30:07**members of the family get super help when they all work together and they do it everybody says I never felt so**1:30:12**healthy in my life um gu tanom had Advanced prostate cancer he wrote a book and he's on the web and he had**1:30:19**hypertension high blood pressure overweight more obesity and all everything and then he does uh 18**1:30:25**several 18-day water only fasts got himself everything all these things went away his diabetes went away his**1:30:31**hypertension high blood pressure and the cancer can't be found so is he cured I have no idea but but he's managed yes**1:30:38**he's managed and he's healthier so what's wrong with that isn't that isn't that ultimately what medicine wants to**1:30:44**do keep people alive longer and a healthier quality of life yeah how many more do we need they say oh that's a  <br>**What Would Dr Seyfried Say To Someone Listening?1:30:51**fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke how many damn flukes do you want if there's someone listening now and I'm sure**1:30:57**there's going to be many thousands and tens of thousands of people listening um that are currently battling cancer have early**1:31:05**stage diagnosis I know I feel bad about this because people say oh I want to do medicab bolic therapy where can I go and**1:31:11**they go to their local hospital and get slapped down there's no evidence there's everything that's should come out of my mouth has never been taught to me in**1:31:17**medical school so what do you say to those people you know I say I I say the**1:31:24**I I'm sorry that the medical establishment has not come to recognize what I'm saying and then I tell them WR**1:31:31**your c i i you know it's it's the change has to be coming from the people ain't going to come from the top medical**1:31:37**schools they they are doing what they're doing very the status quo is very**1:31:42**profitable the status quo is very effective for these people but it's not helping the cancer patient uh as well as**1:31:48**it can and don't forget we're not throwing out all this stuff we're just asking people to know how to use the tools we have in a better way we don't**1:31:55**have to throw out immunotherapies radiation we don't have to throw out toxic poisons we just have to know**1:32:00**better how to use it when the patient is in this new state and the data will prove it but who's going to do that**1:32:07**who's going to do that the doctor says I'd love to do this if I but I'm going to lose my license if I do it what**1:32:12**what's going on with that they wrote the standard of care as if it were in granted can't be changed no it should be**1:32:18**flexible when new eviden|## SUMMARY  <br>Professor Thomas Seyfried discusses cancer as a metabolic disease and advocates for metabolic therapies, including the ketogenic diet.  <br>  <br>## IDEAS:  <br>- Cancer’s rising incidence suggests lifestyle changes impact its development and prevention significantly.  <br>- Traditional views perceive cancer primarily as a genetic disorder rather than a metabolic one.  <br>- Studies show cancer is rare in traditional societies, implying diet affects cancer prevalence.  <br>- Metabolic therapy utilizes dietary changes to treat cancer more effectively than conventional methods.  <br>- A ketogenic diet lowers blood sugar, potentially reducing tumor growth and enhancing treatment efficacy.  <br>- Specific metabolic therapies can improve survival rates in terminal cancer patients significantly.  <br>- The glucose-ketone index helps monitor dietary impact on cancer progression and metabolic state.  <br>- Mitochondrial dysfunction is central to cancer development, indicating a focus on cellular metabolism.  <br>- Exercise plays a crucial role in reducing cancer risk by lowering blood sugar and glutamine levels.  <br>- Emotional stress and lack of sleep negatively affect mitochondrial health, increasing cancer risk.  <br>- Metabolic therapy can be a non-toxic alternative to conventional cancer treatments like chemotherapy.  <br>- Historical evidence suggests humans evolved with diets low in carbohydrates, impacting modern health.  <br>- The industrial food environment contributes to rising obesity and chronic diseases, including cancer.  <br>- Cancer cells thrive on glucose and glutamine, necessitating their restriction for effective treatment.  <br>- The scientific community faces resistance to the idea that cancer is primarily a metabolic disorder.  <br>- Changing dietary habits can prevent and manage cancer, emphasizing individual responsibility for health.  <br>  <br>## INSIGHTS:  <br>- Embracing a holistic understanding of cancer as a metabolic disorder can reshape treatment approaches.  <br>- Lifestyle choices significantly influence cancer risk, highlighting the importance of personal dietary decisions.  <br>- The effectiveness of metabolic therapies underscores the need for integrative medicine in cancer treatment.  <br>- Progress in cancer treatment can be achieved by refocusing on metabolic health rather than genetics.  <br>- Public health initiatives must address dietary habits to combat rising cancer rates effectively.  <br>- Understanding mitochondria’s role in energy metabolism can lead to breakthroughs in cancer management.  <br>- Encouraging healthier diets may mitigate the cancer epidemic and improve overall public health.  <br>- Personal responsibility for health choices is vital in preventing chronic diseases like cancer.  <br>- Research on cancer metabolism could revolutionize how we approach prevention and treatment.  <br>- Promoting exercise and stress management can enhance mitochondrial health and reduce cancer risk.  <br>  <br>## QUOTES:  <br>- “Cancer is very preventable when the medical establishment acknowledges what I know about this disorder.”  <br>- “Cancer was extremely rare in African tribes that were living according to traditional ways.”  <br>- “Metabolic therapy can be used as both prevention and treatment.”  <br>- “If you do metabolic therapy, you can actually reduce risk for cancer.”  <br>- “Cancer is a metabolic disorder, not just a genetic disease.”  <br>- “We can selectively restrict the two fuels while transitioning the body over to ketones.”  <br>- “The mitochondria is the center of the problem with cancer, not the nucleus.”  <br>- “Cancer cells depend on fermentation energy without oxygen.”  <br>- “Fasting is a powerful way to get your body into nutritional ketosis.”  <br>- “We evolved as a species to be in nutritional ketosis for the majority of our existence.”  <br>- “Our food science and technology has evolved faster than our biology.”  <br>- “Exercise lowers blood sugar and helps manage cancer risk.”  <br>- “Metabolic therapy is an effective non-toxic management for cancer.”  <br>- “The scientific evidence is there, and it’s just a matter of time.”  <br>- “Cancer can be managed effectively through dietary changes and metabolic therapies.”  <br>- “There’s no major advance in reducing cancer death rates.”  <br>  <br>## HABITS:  <br>- Regular exercise maintains mitochondrial health and supports overall metabolic function effectively.  <br>- Monitoring blood sugar and ketone levels can help manage cancer risk and treatment effectiveness.  <br>- Following a ketogenic diet may prevent cancer by restricting glucose and glutamine availability.  <br>- Practicing intermittent fasting can aid in achieving nutritional ketosis and improving metabolic health.  <br>- Reducing processed carbohydrates in the diet supports healthier mitochondrial function and cancer prevention.  <br>- Maintaining a balanced lifestyle includes managing stress, ensuring adequate sleep, and exercising regularly.  <br>- Engaging in community and social connections enhances emotional well-being and reduces cancer risk.  <br>- Prioritizing whole foods over processed options can improve overall health and reduce disease risk.  <br>- Staying informed about dietary impacts on health empowers better food choices and cancer prevention.  <br>- Making conscious food choices helps maintain metabolic health and support cancer management.  <br>  <br>## FACTS:  <br>- Nearly two million new cancer cases are diagnosed annually in the United States.  <br>- Approximately 1,700 people die from cancer daily in the U.S., highlighting its severity.  <br>- Cancer is projected to become increasingly prevalent globally by 2050 if current trends continue.  <br>- Traditional diets in some cultures correlate with significantly lower cancer rates.  <br>- Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to the development of various cancers worldwide.  <br>- The fermentation process is central to cancer cell metabolism, emphasizing dietary impact.  <br>- The American Cancer Society reports over 600,000 cancer-related deaths annually in the U.S.  <br>- Exercise can lower both blood sugar and glutamine, two fuels driving cancer growth.  <br>- High blood sugar levels correlate with faster tumor growth in both human and mouse studies.  <br>- Cancer cells can survive without oxygen, relying on fermentation for energy production.  <br>  <br>## REFERENCES:  <br>- "Cancer as a Metabolic Disease: On the Origin, Management, and Prevention of Cancer" by Thomas Seyfried.  <br>- Research papers from Boston College focusing on metabolic therapy and cancer.  <br>- The glucose-ketone index calculator developed by Seyfried and his students for patient monitoring.  <br>- Studies on the effectiveness of ketogenic diets in managing cancer and improving survival rates.  <br>- Reports on the impact of exercise on cancer prevention and overall metabolic health.  <br>  <br>## ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY  <br>Understanding cancer as a metabolic disease emphasizes the importance of dietary and lifestyle changes for prevention and management.  <br>  <br>## RECOMMENDATIONS:  <br>- Adopt a ketogenic diet to help manage blood sugar and reduce cancer risk effectively.  <br>- Engage in regular physical activity to enhance mitochondrial health and overall well-being.  <br>- Monitor glucose and ketone levels to optimize dietary choices and health outcomes.  <br>- Incorporate intermittent fasting into your routine to achieve nutritional ketosis.  <br>- Educate yourself on the metabolic aspects of cancer to make informed health decisions.  <br>- Reduce processed foods and sugars in your diet for better metabolic health.  <br>- Foster supportive social relationships to improve emotional health and reduce stress.  <br>- Prioritize sleep and stress management as essential components of cancer prevention.  <br>- Explore metabolic therapies as a complementary approach to conventional cancer treatments.  <br>- Stay proactive about health choices and seek knowledge on cancer prevention strategies.|**Description:** In this groundbreaking podcast episode, cancer expert Dr. Thomas Seyfried

And thank you.0:14**first and foremost thanks everybody I really appreciate all the hosting and**0:20**amazing celebrations and going on around the world it was**0:26**super fun for me to be part of and to watch and to participate in so thank you**0:31**very much for all of that and what I thought we would do is bounce back and**0:38**forth between these questions here and I'll**0:44**I'll do improv jav as improv jav improv Jazz as we go through and I'll pick some**0:51**questions and then we will also do some live questions so why don't we start with some live**0:58**questions I'll hop in here and I'll answer as many questions as I can that were presubmit as well RJ from Malaga**1:07**Spain believe it or not I have some ancestors from Malaga Spain one of them was killed in a bull fight so be careful**1:14**with the bull fights all right if you had to pick a topic for your podcast that I'd stick to from now on topic or  <br>**A focus on reinvention.1:21**theme would you pick probably reinvention of different types I think I**1:27**would focus on people who have reinvented themselves instead of sticking with the tried and true Groove**1:32**people who have taken the time or the space or just the attention to step back**1:39**and reexamine their assumptions reexamine the things that have worked up to this point that may not be those**1:46**things directionally that they want to continue pursuing so reinvention I think Kate and Cody how do you think about  <br>**Optimization.1:52**over optimization uh today many of us have the resources to enable us to spend**1:57**countless percentage of our life tweaking and attempting to op optimize every little thing I would say that you**2:03**want to pick very carefully what you choose to optimize as a very dear friend of mine I won't mention him by name**2:09**because you might not like that but very top 1% of 1% in terms of performer put**2:15**it to me he's like you want to be incredibly excellent the best you can be**2:20**in one or two things and then for everything else it's good enough passing grade for everything else**2:26**and he walks that walk and got a great family he's a great husband and father**2:33**he's very good at the things he chooses to optimize and for the rest he's not  <br>**Recent joy.2:39**worried Claudine what has brought me a ton of Joy or fun recently archery I've**2:44**been doing a lot of archery training not sure if you can see my forearms they are all screwed up I was shooting both right**2:51**and left-handed but find that incredibly uh joyful and meditative all right Joel**2:57**Hello Joel our group had so much in common it was so fun everyone wants to stay connected they asked if there might be more opportunities for me to**3:02**facilitate keeping us connected in the future the greatest joy that I got from the parties for the 10th anniversary and**3:09**so on was how many people came together with some shared interests or Curiosities at least who then wanted to**3:17**hang out after the event people who wanted to stay connected that made me super super happy that was really The**3:24**Not So secret agenda all along so that made me really happy and I'd like to explore ways that I can facilitate that**3:30**without having to manage it myself Cindy has a question [ __ ] punch update please  <br>**A CØCKPUNCH update.3:36**yes I have a ton of artwork and a lot of material to share with respect to World**3:42**building and frankly I've let Perfection be the enemy of good I've wanted to**3:48**present all this stuff in this high production value video with all the**3:53**bells and whistles and I've been sitting on this stuff for many months now and uh**3:59**I think that is my perfectionism getting in the way of Simply sharing these things so I have lots of stuff to share**4:08**and I need to get on that I would say in the next few weeks doesn't need to be fancy I feel at this point Expediting is**4:15**more important than optimizing delivery all right oh God worst funniest date I've**4:21**been on yeah we'll need another live chat to cover that Arena how am I today  <br>**How the day’s going so far.4:27**I'm doing really well uh beautiful day here it's a little warm I don't handle heat terribly well I'm going to go shoot**4:32**arrows after this Q&A and hang out with Molly outside I'll have her behind the**4:38**line of fire she's a very good archery dog in that way and uh a little tired**4:43**I'm not sure why I might have a fever I've been training really hard so who knows maybe there's a bug in the food or**4:49**something I've been very tired today it's unclear why cuz I got plenty of sleep um so that's how I am today but**4:55**happy to be doing the Q&A this is from Andre Andy from bu say what place does  <br>**Argentina affection.5:01**Argentina occupy in my heart today and why well I have deep affection for Argentina and the RGS and I would like**5:08**to get back down there honestly I recently for the first time in 20 years basically went to a Tango Festival in**5:16**Austin so I bought new shoes I didn't even have shoes I haven't done Tango in ages and I've forgotten 99% of it which**5:23**is very painful for me but had a blast just had so much fun there's nothing like it so I think at some point it's**5:30**possible I'll go back to Argentina and do 3 to four weeks full immersion tons of Tango lots of steak and probably lots**5:38**of malbeck at the same time uh so I would say I'm I'm very eager to get down**5:44**there revisit it learn of the current events and leadership in particular in**5:49**Argentina which I find very interesting and we'll go from there what type of business/ investment is the most  <br>**Intriguing investments.5:56**exciting for me right now anything that is aligned I'd say and this isn't an invitation for pitches but anything**6:02**that's really aligned with my the sort of ethos that I might**6:09**be looking to incorporate more in my life so for instance Maui neie venison from an ecological perspective from a**6:16**Founder perspective husband and wife team incredibly high integrity beautiful**6:22**family beautiful people and also very good operators it's a good business but**6:27**it's also doing a lot for or the sort of native ecosystem in Hawaii so that'd be**6:35**an example of something that's I feel very aligned with even though it's not the kind of tech multiples that we would be used to in potential outcomes**6:42**something I feel very good about also very involved with quite a bit of climate work and let's just call it**6:48**technology intended to help with many of the extreme weather and climate**6:54**challenges that we're going to continue to face top three snacks I'm eating right now  <br>**Top three snacks.7:00**yeah I mean I have Maui Nei right around the corner so the Maui Nei venison sticks and then often it's it's some**7:06**type of mixed nuts minus peanuts and let's say cans of lentils so boring**7:14**but I find that very helpful there are a number of questions about AI I would say  <br>**AI thoughts.7:19**I largely feel unqualified to have strong opinions about this but if I**7:26**invest and I've invested in one or two AI SP focused**7:31**companies they're very Niche and they have some type of at least intermediate**7:38**term defensible mode a lot of the AI stuff that's trained on publicly**7:44**available data is just going to get cloned as soon as it shows any traction and uh as some people may have noticed a**7:51**lot of stuff that was web 3 at one point those people have now pivoted into Ai**7:56**and I'm I'm trying to be cautious of anything that is kind of the investment**8:02**sector dour and there's still interesting things in web 3 although I think**8:07**blockchain is probably a better way to put it and they're very interesting things in AI but I like to invest in**8:14**what I know where I think I have an informational advantage and I do not think I have an informational Advantage**8:20**with AI question on on a few different things I'll pick two of these on Modern dating as a public figure how do you  <br>**Modern dating.8:26**navigate the complexities of modern da I would say slowly and very carefully**8:32**what qualities do I look for in a partner to ensure a meaningful and sustainable relationship well first and foremost I would say the the smaller the**8:39**social media footprint the more comfortable I am but it also makes it very hard to find people if they're not online since it's not like I'm going out**8:46**to bars and just doing cold approaches so I would say uh**8:52**discretion someone who prefers a certain degree of privacy those are those are all indicators for me and in the**8:59**positive direction for trustworthiness I recognize a lot of people live online so that's just the**9:05**nature of our current day but I look for those things a demonstrated ability to**9:11**do hard things over longer periods of time I want to know that life isn't always hard for someone so if they're**9:17**able to focus on let's just say higher education for four years at a demanding**9:24**University that doesn't automatically make them a Super Genius who's perfect for me but it shows probably they're**9:29**able to focus on on certain things that are challenging for extended periods of time same thing if they've been at jobs**9:35**for at least some jobs for more than one or two years if it's constantly Lily Pad**9:42**hopping all over the place I don't find that to always mean someone is very**9:49**resilient when things get hard and things always get hard at some point so**9:54**those are a few then there's all the stuff you could guess you know beautiful feminine all that stuff uh but I would**10:03**say those are those are a few also someone who has an identity where they feel confident in having done hard**10:10**things that's the other benefit of I would say people who have done something objectively to the extent that**10:17**it's possible difficult is they have a certain confidence that helps the whole relationship right I feel like you need**10:24**to have a certain identity confidence in your own own ability and skills and selfhood**10:32**self-authoring before you can really be a good partner I think that's I think**10:37**that's the case as best I can tell but I'm I don't think I'm the last person**10:42**you would want relationship advice from but let's wait until I have it a little more figured out on self-experimentation  <br>**Self-experimentation to come.10:48**you're known as using yourself as a guinea pig what are the next five things I'm planning to experiment with uh I'll**10:54**probably get back on look I I don't do as much crazy experimentation as I used to I am looking at some regenerative**11:01**medicine protocols uh possibly for helping inflammation and some of the lower back stuff which is greatly**11:07**improved since I started doing a few things but the jury is still out so I'm not going to get into that yet I don't want to make any prescriptive**11:14**recommendations until I've really tested things and uh archery training bunch of new types of archery training that I'm**11:20**excited to play around with and uh beyond that really a lot of it is just**11:27**putting in the work with things that I believe will be high leverage like working**11:33**on hips internal and external rotation and a few other things that I think**11:38**directly contribute to overall core and low**11:44**back functionality for lack of a better way to put it but nothing crazy in my**11:50**opinion uh some of the medical stuff people might think is crazy but it's it's pretty pretty solid research that's**11:57**backing this stuff you know 10 to 20 years of research search so I don't I don't feel like it's high risk what risks have I taken in the last 10 years  <br>**Analyzing the past decade’s risks.12:03**that have really paid off are there any that did not pay off well you know the**12:08**podcast we could look at as a risk but risk for me is a very specific thing so**12:14**when people say this is risky this isn't risky I think definitions matter a lot for me risk is the potential of an**12:22**irreversible negative outcome very few things fall in that category so the podcast was very off the**12:28**beaten path for me but I didn't view it as risky because I could always stop doing it I could always just hit cancel**12:35**it was low cost to get started I enjoyed the process so the outcome wasn't the**12:40**only measure of success for me and uh that was quite a Divergence**12:46**that paid off certainly paid off I would say that I've made some good investment**12:52**calls and I've made some bad investment calls so the good ones fortunately make up more than make up for the the bad**12:59**ones but with let's just say web 3 as an example I went very heavy and hard into**13:05**a lot of web 3 and put money into a bunch of different funds and various things uh cockp punch as an nft project**13:12**was successful and I set expectations I think properly at the beginning uh if you go back and read that fq like I've**13:18**delivered on all of those and I'm going to deliver continually beyond that I have a lot more to share and everyone**13:24**else has run for the not everyone else but pretty much everyone else has run for the Hills and they're like forget**13:29**about all that no no forget about all that sleep sleep they don't want anybody to remember I don't mind at all because**13:36**I didn't I took all those proceeds and donated to the foundation the foundation Cay Foundation is going to do some**13:42**amazing work with the whatever it ended up being $2 million or something maybe a little bit**13:47**more so a lot of good will come of that and it was a huge creative Catalyst for**13:54**me and I think that without that I wouldn't be working on a new book**14:00**project right now as an example so it it checked all the boxes in terms of its objectives but as a sector I would say**14:08**uh took a took a lot of huge hits on that one and you live and learn you know I**14:14**wasn't playing with money I couldn't afford to lose but it was it was enough that it was very painful so there's an**14:21**experiment that didn't pan out but there's a reason they call them experiments and not**14:27**guarantees uh but yeah you got to choose your bet sizing properly so you don't put yourself in a bad situation all right so**14:35**that risks that it paid off that was from Rebecca Andre currently in a moment where I  <br>**Outthinking a career bottleneck.14:40**don't know what to do professionally have you had those moments yeah right now I'm not sure not sure what I want to**14:46**be when I grow up and uh some days it's really stressful to be honest which sounds silly I know but it is I like**14:53**having a plan I like executing to plan so the book is really the only**14:58**thing that is in my sights at the moment that uh looks clear otherwise what I'm**15:06**doing my best to do is try a lot of little things little experiments expose**15:12**myself to new people have couple of exploratory conversations a week or read**15:19**things listen to things I wouldn't usually read or listen to and have confidence because I've figured it out**15:26**multiple times in the past that I will figure it out again I don't need to fog myself unnecessarily I've yet to find**15:33**that helpful so that may not be super tactical at this point but that's that's**15:40**what I've been telling myself on my good days when I'm not beating the [ __ ] out of myself in my own head David what is  <br>**My current big project.15:45**your current next project that I'm excited about how are you approaching it differently so this is I say the new**15:53**book I'm actually being much more collaborative with this book than I have in the past and that that's proving to**15:59**be a godsend because I have people to bounce things off of and to interact with it's just psychologically I think**16:07**much healthier at least at this point in my life than being a lone wolf on these**16:12**projects because Lone Wolf it's not a thing by the way like look at nature no Lone Wolf survives doesn't**16:18**work so I'm uh using that as a broad way to experiment and by the way [ __ ] punch**16:25**was a precursor to that because I worked really well with what you guys will see soon with the concept art and a lot of**16:32**the collaborative writing that was done and it was awesome it was a great process really had fun it wasn't just**16:38**locking myself in a cave like I'm in solitary confinement and that is what I'm trying**16:45**to emulate also in the uh writing of this new book so we'll see I mean I have**16:52**about four or 500 pages drafted so it's going to be it's going to be another big**16:57**one but you know that's what I do have you experimented with peptides I  <br>**Peptides.17:03**experimented with uh is it BMP 157 or bpc 157 like 12 years ago long time ago**17:10**so I am at a date with peptides but I did experiment way back in the**17:16**day but I really need to educate myself before I can have any thoughts on that**17:21**whatsoever and by the way just as a quick aside with anyone online if they  <br>**Be wary of high conviction.17:27**only have high conviction statements if they really speak confidently all the time be very wary of those**17:34**people people who are being honest should say I have no [ __ ] idea all the time or they should say you know**17:41**what I'm not really sure I need to educate myself everyone online should have that**17:46**response a lot if they don't then you're not going to be able to separate out the real from the fake because they're saying everything with the same high**17:52**level of conviction be really careful about that what mindfulness practices do I use to prepare for high stakes  <br>**Preparation for high-stakes presentations.17:58**presentation or performances I would say I don't let**18:05**fear make me afraid in the sense that I I really remind myself if you weren't**18:12**nervous right then it would be a bigger problem it is normal to be nervous**18:17**before you go up like my hands are shaking a little bit I've done these things hundreds of times and I still get nervous I still get sweaty I still drink**18:24**too much Diet Coke or coffee or whatever beforehand as a ritual which just makes me more shaky obviously and it's like**18:32**it's okay it's fine like anyone who's going out to perform at a high level or attempting to do it at a high level is**18:39**going to be nervous so just use it like Mike Tyson would puke before he went on stage well on stage in the ring Dean**18:45**Martin used to puke before he went on stage I mean these These are legends right I'm not saying you want to emulate everything about them but these are**18:51**people who are at the top of their field so it's okay for them it's okay for you so I just remind myself of that and and**18:59**I will rehearse my ass off there's no mental trick you can do beforehand if you haven't prepared and for me the**19:07**preparation is the mindfulness practice I mean with my TED talk like I rehearsed**19:12**it so many times into voice memo on my phone walking around I mean hundreds of times so by the time I got to the day of**19:20**the presentation on the main stage of Ted I was like well I've put in the time**19:26**the deliberate practice I've done everything I can do so I am as prepared**19:31**as I will ever be so let it rip let's see what happens uh I'd say that's**19:37**that's the mindfulness practice I thought about doing content more geared at kids  <br>**Kid stuff?19:43**teens yeah I've thought about that I thought about it I'm not sure what the best venue is but I am going to be doing**19:49**some experimentation for students probably older students though kind of University or business school  <br>**Getting the most out of a Tim Ferriss meetup.19:56**level what am I looking to get out of the TF meetups and how can we help how can you help you know that was a**20:03**question so if some folks have asked like what question came up a lot some of the questions are just like hey how's it going because the interactions are so**20:10**short they're like hey how's it going um you know where you where are you where do you want to go and then we'd run out**20:15**of time but one of the questions was like how can we be helpful to you and my answer was and is now connect with**20:23**like-minded people do stuff in real life and this ties into AI it's like if if**20:28**you want to if you want to I think harness your**20:36**Humanity do stuff in real life like meet people man because the Poison's coming**20:42**in terms of information delus it's going to 10x in the next 10 to 18 months and**20:48**most minds and habits are not going to be ready for that I think it's**20:54**impossible to be ready but to be more resilient I would just say do more in real life like connect with like-minded**21:00**people try to do meetups you can do Zoom or something like that if you can't do**21:06**live but like really seek out your tribe and if those people happen to overlap with the people**21:12**who came to the meetups which was my hope then great like you just connected with a bunch of people who might**21:21**be of kind of similar similar tribe so I would say I would say do that will I  <br>**In-person conferences planned?21:27**plan any iners some conferences I don't have any plans right this moment um Joel I see your note on IBS I don't have a  <br>**IBS relief.21:34**lot of thoughts on IBS I apologize I just don't know much about it uh I mean you what you could do and I**21:41**don't know if this will work but I mean you could just use like metamol citrus cell beforehand I mean it does slow**21:47**gastric emptying and it does also reduce glycemic index so if you're going to eat a meal you know it's going to spike your**21:52**glycemic index side note you can take like five of these capsules with uh fiber just a slow things down so that**21:59**the release isn't as intense uh so but I'm not a doctor I try not to pretend to**22:05**be one on the internet but I I really don't know much about IBS unfortunately but I'm looking at**22:13**anti-inflammatory protocols that could have an effect on this type of issue but I haven't looked at it well**22:19**enough so I don't want to give you any opinions what are some of my heresies um I mean I think a heresy that  <br>**Personal heresies.22:27**I have is just I think a lot of what we try to do**22:32**in Modern Life is a very new experiment right so I think if we look back at**22:38**older societies and they're not all rose-colored right it's it's very**22:44**seductive to look back at indigenous group X Y or Z and say oh you know they had it all figured out they were in tune**22:49**with nature and it's like well if you go back you also very often even now see**22:55**domestic abuse and lots of alcoholism other issues so it's it's not ever perfect anywhere but I would say if we**23:03**look at what gives people meaning I think we've been LED astray**23:08**with a lot of kind of brainwashing and theory that doesn't map very well to**23:17**anthropological study or really just common behaviors that you see around the world that seem to have some durability**23:24**and Nasim Talib talks about this a lot so I would just say broadly thinking**23:30**that in a lot of ways individually just in terms of like rugged individualism**23:36**we've gone off track a bit and**23:41**that a lot of the I'd say common ways that we plan our careers and lives are**23:48**actually at odds with ultimately what's going to give us fulfillment I would say can unpack that more another time so a  <br>**What makes conferences worthwhile for me?23:55**couple people asking about conferences maybe maybe at some point I'll do a conference it would be quite small you**24:00**know it wouldn't be more than 200 people so if I ever did it it's a lot of work frankly and when I did it last time it**24:09**was basically not for profit because I spent so much money on the quality of the event so I don't know I'm I'm not**24:16**sure I have the energy to do it as a nonprofit and if it were not to be a nonprofit it would just be stupidly**24:21**expensive it would be like 30 grand a person or something obscene which I would feel kind of silly  <br>**Longevity and healthspan.24:28**putting out there how realistic is it to consider the health span possibility RJ**24:33**to get to 150 years old in good health I'm not really sure how to evaluate this to be honest I I'm more focused these**24:40**days on experiential lifespan and trying to harness and I've spoken about this**24:46**before but trying to organize events Gatherings of**24:53**friends in some cases very intense physical experiences like long difficult**24:58**hikes or pilgrimage trails with people I really care for to basically pack a few**25:05**months into say a week at a time I think that's a reliable actionable way to extend your**25:12**experiential lifespan right to feel like you've basically packed 150 years into your let's say 85 uh most attempts at**25:23**extending longevity in any meaningful way have all failed to date right and maybe we are in**25:29**fact at this cusp of all these Amazing Discoveries that will lead us to live a really long time maybe that's Rapa maybe**25:35**that's some type of Tim restricted feeding maybe that is fall of Statin maybe it's who the [ __ ] knows you know**25:43**there's always something there's always some new ponon Fountain of Youth that**25:48**people have found especially on the internet I'm not super bullish on that stuff here's the thing I would say for**25:55**myself they're likely to fail so I would rather have low expectations and be pleasantly surprised later than to take**26:03**all of these things and suffer what will most definitely be significant side effects**26:10**that we haven't foreseen with a lot of this new stuff so like fall stat for instance like it basically cripples FSH and**26:18**animal models so it's like do you really want to be infertile uh can you reverse that after the fact like yeah great you**26:24**have eight pack and you look younger than you did 8 weeks ago but now your balls don't work so I'm not ready to**26:31**make that trade you know maybe after I have three or four kids sure but uh I would just be very careful with that**26:37**kind of stuff so 150 I mean if we're talking about that in the next you know**26:44**basically putting people on a Glide path that will land them there in the next 10 to 15 years I'm pretty skeptical I mean**26:50**especially with increases in environmental toxins and other issues that will besiege Humanity over the next**26:57**10 to 20 years certainly I mean more weather issues forc migrations all sorts of [ __ ] um I'm not dystopian about it**27:06**but I'm not it should tell you something that I'm not about my personal beliefs at**27:12**least that I'm not doing a lot of that stuff yeah I mean if you account for infant mortality and antibiotics and**27:19**then you look at say my entire family history on both sides it's like yeah males tend to die around 85 that's just**27:25**the way it goes so I would love to live longer but I'm not going to take a lot of**27:31**unnecessary risks where I see significant potential downside so long answer I'm interested in it for sure**27:38**like I track some of the science Andy Bruce any tips on walk in the Kumo cot though taking your 11-year-old son with  <br>**Tips for a father-and-son Kumano Kodo walk.27:44**you that's cool that's fun uh there are a million different ways to walk this pilgrimage Trail in Japan which is the**27:52**sister Trail of the commo de Santiago in Europe there's the only two**27:58**world heritage pilgrimage Trails so there are like a thousand different ways you can do the kumoko it's like a**28:05**tributaries that then filter down to the main Shrine and Temple because they**28:12**basically took like Shinto mapping and then put Buddhism on top of it I would**28:17**pick one that crosses rivers and water if you can that's just really Pleasant feature when you're hauling ass and**28:24**getting really sweaty and so on bring walking sticks for sure like poles**28:31**especially for the downhill you'll be walking on Rock a lot it's very hard on the joints so nice thick heels you know**28:39**hoca shoes or something like that I would suggest like you will feel it in**28:44**your ankles and your knees and uh you know my thought is if you're going to do something longer because some people**28:51**will do like a week at a time or 10 days at a time you could spend months on the K codo is do a little bit less than you**28:59**think you can each day like don't push it super hard because you may be then handicapped the next day if your knee**29:04**really bothers you you're not going to you're not going to want to put a lot of weight on that for the next 10**29:10**kilometers or 20 kilom right so I'd do a little bit less than you think you can each day something about the Tweet of  <br>**A barbell distribution approach to life.29:17**the kettle B swings is King of the exercise where else can you find the king of X could be relationships Finance**29:22**anything I think you I think a lot about barbell approaches to life so for**29:28**instance like highrisk Angel Investing and then like mun bonds as boring and as stable as you get right so it's kind of**29:34**one or the other like highrisk high return with small amounts of money or**29:40**very stable predictable boring and not playing in the middle as soon as you start playing**29:46**in the middle you're like I'm going to play with tech growth stocks da da and then you at least in my experience**29:52**that's how you get your face ripped off or that's how I get I get my face ripped off so I think about barbell distributions a lot in physical Fitness**29:58**and finance and everywhere aside from Richard Fineman if I could bring back one person from the dead for a podcast  <br>**Who would I resurrect for a podcast interview?30:05**episode who would it be oh man there's so many right I'm tempted to say like Marcus Aurelius or something but Sena**30:13**who knows I mean probably senica because I've just read so much of his stuff and I'm curious if I would find the guy to be an arrogant prick or what the vibe**30:21**would be in person right assuming we're speaking the same language I would be super curious about senica he gets a**30:27**very mixed review but I mean I'm once again listening to an audio book uh on anger or Ona**30:34**Ira I mean his writing is amazing the guy's writing is amazing but what would he be like in person would I be like oh**30:41**yeah this is the uncle who talks too much God this guy's longwinded maybe Ben Franklin I'd be interested very**30:47**interested in um those are a few that come to mind I mean I I could come up with 100 more for sure but those are**30:54**those are two off the top of my head do I have any mentors that I contact regularly for Life advice this is from  <br>**Do I consult any mentors regularly?30:59**Jeff I found in midlife that I really missed out on having fatherly mentors in my 20s and 30s yeah there are I talked**31:05**to uh one this morning in fact he's uh early 70s very**31:11**healthy really takes care of himself great marriage close to his kids and I think he has grandkids now and so we did**31:18**a check-in for about an hour today caught up and this is a good reminder for me to do**31:25**that more often so I do feel I do feel good good about that Paula what are my  <br>**Ayahuasca and antidepressants.31:30**thoughts on iasa on anti-depressants you've been doing iwaska for 13 years only just started taking anti-depressants unsure if I**31:37**should mix both this is from Brazil you need to be very very very careful so IA**31:44**plus certain anti-depressants like ssris can cause a potentially fatal serotonin**31:49**syndrome so you need to be very very very careful with that so I would**31:55**absolutely speak with doctors about that I not mix them until you get the go ahead from doctors and I I imagine a**32:02**psychiatrist who prescribe the anti-depressants I'd be very careful with that iasa is one of the one of the**32:08**riskier compounds at least of the let's call it classically known psychedelics with respect to combining**32:14**with anti-depressants so I'd be very careful with that and side note I learned not too long ago that people who**32:21**were taking Lithium should really not screw around with psychedelics a lot of Adverse Events**32:27**been reported at least with some of the classical let's just call it not not entirely tryptamine but LSD**32:35**psilocybin Etc so if you're taking higher doses of of lithium now there's some there are some ways that could be**32:43**conflated because of people are taking lithium what are they taking it for they might be taking it for any number of conditions that would be contraindicated**32:48**with psychedelics in the first place so who knows but uh I wouldn't mix lithium**32:54**with these things either how can you incentivize someone to Mentor you I'm not sure how to do that I mean I I think  <br>**Incentivizing potential mentors.33:01**you need to be a really good student number one he said no money possible I mean frankly I pay I pay for it a lot I**33:08**mean I have friends who learn from me and I learn from them and they're older than I am and I consider them**33:14**mentors but at the end of the day I actually find it in some ways cleaner to**33:20**just pay someone and uh if you wanted to get mentorship that isn't expensive like**33:26**maybe you go to Toastmaster or you join the EO like entrepreneurs organization**33:32**or YPO depends on what you're looking for but like mentors don't need to be expensive at all you know I have a**33:38**mentor in archery and he's also kind of a mental performance coach doesn't need**33:43**to break the bank so I would say you know you can go to your local YMCA and find a coach in some Sport and if**33:50**they're good at all at anything they will have life lessons for you especially if they're a bit older so I**33:57**would say that my advice for the moment do I babysit sometimes for some of my friends uh I mean not really  <br>**Adventures in babysitting.34:04**babysit but like I'll watch their kids for a little bit or watch a Disney movie with their kids like young kids uh how**34:10**did I find it I think I look I think I'm a kid at heart so for me animals and kids are I don't want to**34:17**say easy but especially if they're little I find them pretty easy I think**34:24**when if I have kids which is the Hope at least if they get to the point where they're like**34:31**petulant kind of like mean-spirited um kids where they're just**34:37**being [ __ ] I think I'll have a hard time with that I think I will have a hard time once they like know which buttons they're pushing and they're just**34:43**like drilling it in that I'm going to have trouble with but like little kids who just like are disregulated and lose**34:49**their [ __ ] because they haven't developed their prefrontal cortex like yeah like I can I can deal with that**34:55**pretty well my opinion of this is from Judy  <br>**GLP-1 for depression/anxiety.35:00**glp1 medications this would be like munaro or OIC uh glp want agonists believe they're**35:08**in clinical trials now for depression anxiety yeah I haven't looked at them specifically for that did put up a blog**35:14**post recently from Johan Hari on glp1 specifically so if you want to get some**35:20**of the science and also a firsthand report of that I would uh just go on tim. blog and search Johan J n n last**35:28**name Har h a r i all right so this piece of artwork you know people love this I  <br>**Cheap but choice art.35:34**love it too I bought this for $80 at an antique Warehouse in the middle of**35:40**nowhere I saw it and I just loved it and grabbed it I love it every time I see it**35:47**maybe it was less 60 60 bucks 80 bucks at an antique Warehouse yeah it's one of**35:52**my favorite pieces of art that's a turkey tail below it a lot of turkeys around here**35:59**uh or not tail turkey feather for agents book agents and stuff uh last time I  <br>**Finding a book agent.36:05**checked which was a long time ago Publishers Marketplace is a great place to look also find books that are kind of**36:10**in the same category or vein as yours look at the acknowledgements and you'll very often see the agent there then you**36:17**can reach out to them directly through something like Publishers Marketplace or these days a lot of these agents or agencies have their own websites  <br>**Making positive, in-person connections.36:23**thoughts on how to approach making some great in-person connections yeah I would look at my talk I gave it South by Southwest which had the title how to**36:31**build a worldclass network in record time something click baity like that but it actually delivers uh I would check**36:38**that out all right this is from Dolan Dolan okay the last set was from Claudine thank you for those this one's  <br>**Unmentioned things I’d like to talk about.36:45**from Dolan if I'm pronouncing that correctly basically anything that I would like to talk about that I haven't**36:51**had an opportunity to talk about yet for instance my interest SL journey in connecting with animals and nature maybe**36:56**some insights for my personal exploration of psychedelic and non-ordinary states of Consciousness over the last 10 years so I**37:05**have probably a thousand pages of notes on all this and at some point I feel**37:11**like that might be the most important book that I write but it's going to be it's going to be a lot to put it**37:17**together so in a way the book I'm doing now where I'm collaborating is sort of a possible warm-up for that because I I**37:23**don't think it's a book that I would want to do by myself it would just be such a heavy lift**37:28**and uh yeah we'll see we shall see but I**37:34**think if I if I talk about that at some huge length it'll probably be in a book I'd want to think about it because it'll**37:40**get so strange it will get so unbelievably strange number one first all the**37:47**scientific regulatory kind of on the radar above the line**37:56**logistical stuff that I want to handle in the Psychedelic Therapeutics world I want to handle first because if I ever**38:03**write this book it is going to get so weird that at least 20% of the people**38:08**who read it are going to think I'm completely insane it'll just be so strange I wouldn't want it to damage my**38:16**current credibility that I have to get things done in those worlds and U**38:21**including some of the stuff with animals man it gets I mean if you talk to people who've**38:28**like been in this stuff for let's just say culturally for**38:33**hundreds or thousands of years it's not weird but to most folks it's going to sound pretty [ __ ] weird which I get**38:40**excited about but I'm going to wait until I'm like you know what I don't give a [ __ ] what anyone thinks cuz it's not going to interrupt anything else**38:46**that I'm doing I don't care then maybe that book but it's going to be a little while this is from  <br>**Is there room for the irrational?38:51**andrece all right so it's a it's a longer let's see here I'll paraphrase**38:57**here basically I'm very rational and methodical about decision-making and so on rational approach is admirable but**39:04**sometimes being a rational or spontaneous can inject a lot of energy and fun have I found space for**39:09**rationality to play a role in my life the irrational and emotional for decisions and if so have they ever led**39:17**me to alter my wellth thought out plans for the year so I would say yes I don't**39:22**know if IR rational it would be the word I would use Maybe because you have**39:28**like let's take moral I don't know what the proper word would be here but you have you have moral behaviors you have**39:35**immoral behaviors and let's just call those nonmoral behaviors then you have amoral behaviors that are kind of like**39:42**in this no man's land so I would say if you have like rational**39:47**rational irrational the opposite then there's like irrational I don't think that's a word but somewhere in the**39:54**middle where it's like it's it's not it's not driven by Logic it's driven**39:59**more by feeling I'm doing more and more of that these days for sure I mean our sort of**40:07**evolved system here with lots of valuable apparatus for navigating**40:14**reality predates Language by at least this kind of language by millions of years so uh**40:22**yes I found space for that although I'd be very careful about I see this quite a**40:27**bit in Austin and places like it where there's this like Neo new Agy stuff**40:33**where people are like I'm just using my intuition and I think very often that is**40:39**used for people used by people who just want a justification for doing what they want to do or doing something that is**40:46**easier than the hard thing and they're like well I'm just using my intuition right intuition is interesting to me**40:51**when it points you in a direction you didn't expect right where let just say**40:57**you go on a date and on paper they're perfect and you're like I'm going to love this person and then you meet them and you're**41:03**like something's a little weird here like I want to like them but this isn't right that's where intuition is valuable**41:10**right or like a business deal everything looks perfect and then there's something about it like uh my gut just doesn't**41:16**feel right that's where intuition is interesting if you're like this all looks perfect on paper and you know what**41:23**even though all my friends are telling me it's a terrible investment my intuition tells me to do it like that's where I'd be like well like wait a**41:29**minute here is this just confirmation bias what are my thoughts on blogging in  <br>**Blogging in the age of AI.41:35**the age of AI I mean look AI is amazing it's really incredible but writing for**41:41**me is a way of clarifying my own thinking and I do think that taking the time to craft words without the**41:47**assistance of AI is helpful I might use AI to get past the blank page but I**41:52**think it's seductive as a drug and just like most people people can't tell**41:58**Direction without Google Maps now I think it's it's very possible almost inevitable that people will lose certain**42:05**faculties that they currently have by overusing AI so uh we shall see but I**42:12**plan on doing more writing to the oldfashioned way I have not used binaural beats I am very interested in  <br>**Binaural beats.42:20**that and actually just reminded me somebody owes me something on binaural beats so if you have any recommendations**42:28**for what types of binaural beads let me know forour dog training yeah maybe  <br>**4-Hour Dog Training?42:35**Never Say Never best thousand I spent lately I mean it was more than that but on the archery training it's always  <br>**Best $1,000 spent lately.42:42**something like that it's very rarely stuff I mean sometimes it's stuff like there's**42:49**a I bought an extra soite PSO RIT and a mini Rumble roller that I**42:59**can travel with and those have been amazing for just like rolling out my**43:06**glutes and per foris and my legs and stuff before bed really helps with sleep a lot but that's like I don't know 100**43:14**bucks 150 um I buy very well I try to buy very little stuff**43:21**it just ends up causing me more stress as clutter around my house than the value that it adds so so I try to get**43:27**rid of a lot of stuff good question of the was the last $1,000 worth of clutter**43:32**that gave me the most relief when I gave it away that's what I should think about am I aware of Javier M I think that's  <br>**Javier Milei.43:39**how you say his name in Argentina I am I've actually listened to some of his speeches pretty interesting stuff I**43:44**don't know enough about them but a number of my friends are are big fans so need to do more research best thing that  <br>**Best thing I spent an “assload” on.43:51**I spent an ass load on uh what's the best thing I spent an ass load on not to get too technical would be a family trip**43:58**I took my parents and brother and his wife on a trip around Europe and um that**44:04**was definitely an assload of cash but I think that was a good good investment and um I would recommend everyone read**44:10**something called The Tail End by Tim Urban that is a good investment of time**44:16**it's very short do I like painting not sketching as a hobby I haven't learned  <br>**Painting.44:21**how to paint I would like to dabble in ideally watercolor I think think but do  <br>**10–20 minutes on the acupuncture mat.44:28**I have any quick tips for getting up to 10 to 20 minutes on the acupuncture mat yeah that's for people who are curious**44:36**the naoya ACU pressure mat I think or other there are a lot of imitations that**44:42**I'm sure just as just as good I don't go to 20 minutes typically but like 10 to**44:48**15 if I'm going to do it the first three minutes are going to be torer so you just have to get through the first like 3 to four minutes is my**44:55**experience otherwise I don't have I don't have much to tell you it can be it can be pretty  <br>**Dating apps.45:01**intense thoughts on dating apps oh man this is like Warren Buffett covering his**45:08**eyes and like pointing towards Wall Street because half the people are going to have terrible experiences uh I don't know to be frank**45:16**I mean I I think hinge has been one of the better options so far I think that**45:22**in terms of just quality people have to pass some hurdles and add some information uh the league is pretty interesting also**45:29**because you can search by interest which is so critical I don't know why you can't do it on any other app but you can**45:35**search for like skiing or whatever to find somebody who has similar interests but the league is really only effective**45:41**in certain cities it's not used widely everywhere but like in a place like New York City or LA or whatever you could**45:47**find people who are pretty well educated interesting uh but a downside is people**45:52**tend not to use it that frequently so you might have a great match and they don't see your message for 6 months**45:59**so go figure it's a jungle out there folks be careful and there are a lot of**46:04**people catfishing so watch out for that too do a video call before you meet up with someone what's my favorite science  <br>**Favorite sci-fi movies.46:11**fiction movie and why big fan of the second Dune movie frankly uh ex bakina I**46:17**remember really enjoying there are a lot of great science fiction movies I think her was fantastic and you know at the time it seemed insane and it's basically**46:25**already there if you look at get the latest editions of chat GPT and so on**46:30**things like replica with a K replica uh yeah her is basically already here it's**46:37**pretty nuts with questions about [ __ ] punch it'll it'll be more interesting once I release the rest of the stuff or**46:45**a bunch of it then you'll have a lot more to chew on and I'll give you a foreshadowing it's not really a**46:50**foreshadowing it is a statement that I hope is a statement of fact and that is I will have some some fan writing**46:57**competitions like elimination competitions and so that**47:02**will reward people who really dig into the details they'll also have to be decent writing of course Claudine have I  <br>**Reflecting on the impact this show has had on others.47:11**let the enormity of 10 years of TFS really land not just from a metrics POV but from a positive kindness deepening**47:17**Etc human level it's been such a Force for good and lighten this world thank you Claud and that's very kind of you to**47:22**say I would say that I I did**47:27**when the celebrations were happening but I could do a better job I could do a**47:33**better job of sitting with that so thank you for the reminder it's easy for me to**47:39**just like move on like yeah yeah good job but like you just did your job so don't get too happy with yourself and**47:45**like what's next what's next right like yeah you did your job and that's fine but like don't get too**47:52**smug about it or self-satisfied but I find that pretty that can be very self-defeating right so I did take time**47:58**to celebrate for the 10th anniversary and I had a great time the inperson meet up in Paris was great and it was really**48:04**fun to in person hear the stories from people who are deeply affected by the podcast so thank you for the reminder I**48:11**will I will um I will take a moment today to revisit that thank**48:17**you I should travel to meet girls well I mean why was I in Europe for 6 to8 weeks  <br>**Why was I in Europe for six to eight weeks?48:23**uh who knows maybe it was related to that is it possible that my mood improved during this Q&A yeah it's  <br>**The mood-altering effects of Q&A.48:29**entirely possible I was exhausted guys I'm not going to lie at the beginning of this but I enjoy these interactions so**48:36**it is certainly possible that my mood improved as a function of my energy going up so thanks for that everybody  <br>**Where do I see myself in 30 years?48:43**where do I see myself in 30 years good Lord I don't know hopefully not six feet under we'll see I'll be 30 years I'll be**48:52**40 no 76 77 [ __ ] so I don't know**48:57**hopefully I'll be doing Black Diamond skiing because uh we found the Fountain of Youth have you suggested a workout  <br>**Workout routines for older parents.49:04**routine this is mags for my parents if not what would it potentially look like how would you approach it yeah I would**49:10**say super slow protocol look up Ken Hutchins and the super slow protocol and**49:16**uh yeah my dad's lost I don't know 80 lbs like let's call it 40 kilos in the last year so he's**49:23**made a lot of progress that's slow carb diet it's a straightforward from four our body and then super slow as applied**49:32**so super slow in in very basic terms is minimum 5 Seconds up 5 Seconds down so if you're doing a pressing movement five**49:39**seconds slow right up five seconds down one set one set to concentric**49:46**failure uh could be even slower could be 10 seconds up 10 seconds down but**49:51**especially in elderly quite effective for building muscle mass and increasing bone density without injury so that is**49:59**probably what I would I mean that's what I prescribed to my parents that plus walking to the extent**50:06**that it's possible Right Kind of barbell once again with slow carb diet is the glue that holds everything together how  <br>**How I walk and talk for podcasts.50:13**do I record a podcast while walking this right here this**50:22**is atm50x it's an Audio Technica headset it's has**50:29**a USBC attachment plug that into your iPhone and then you can use Riverside or some other app there are a lot of**50:36**different ways to record this is from Mariana over the years I've followed and learned from you  <br>**Would I consider becoming a single parent?50:41**and your guest I've heard you say several times that I'm interested in parenting have you ever considered being a single parent family by choice I too**50:46**for many years was trying to find the perfect partner till I turned 41 and my doctor told me it was time to unfreeze my eggs since I was still single and**50:52**look for the partner decided my best option was to be a single parent so I got a non and ious donor and had my son**50:57**when I was 43 as I'm almost six now we travel the world together could not be happier with the drama-free life we have**51:03**just wishing to see you fulfill your parenting dream and wondered if I would consider this option too yeah I would consider it I would consider it you know**51:10**I think for a long time it was no but I would consider it I would I mean of**51:16**course ideally I would have the partner but I would consider it yeah it's not**51:22**off the table but I'm still fighting the fight getting back into the dating as**51:29**much as I'm just like [ __ ] this is this is a young man's game doing this online dating**51:35**[ __ ] uh frankly just the communications burden is so much G yeah**51:42**so anyway but to answer your question yeah it's on the table for me Joel I see  <br>**A $1 million coffee mug?51:47**yours one of my big goals is to create the world's first coffee mug to sell for more than a million dollars I like that**51:53**I like that as a goal I don't really have a great recommendation for how to chip away at**51:59**it you could look at from a PR perspective at least people who**52:04**have you know sold pieces of the Brooklyn Bridge or sold hamburgers that are like**52:10**goldplated or like have have some type of of gold on them for like $300 at some**52:17**pizza joint right and the reason they're doing it is to get attention for everything else so what I would say is**52:22**you could think about selling a million doll coffee mug and make that your past fail or you could come up with a**52:29**compelling argument for why a coffee mug particular coffee mug should sell for a**52:35**million dollars and then use that as a PR hook to bring attention to everything else that you're doing which is probably**52:42**quite a bit easier but if you do that and someone buys it**52:47**great fantastic you did it you sold one for a million bucks now that said if that is the only**52:55**measure of pass fail then it's it's extremely binary but if you were to use it as a means by which**53:01**you draw attention to everything else that you're doing then I think it's pretty interesting so there you have it have I  <br>**Brazil.53:08**been to Brazil yes I've been to Brazil five or six or seven times actually all over the place in fact uh how big is my  <br>**A small but mighty staff.53:15**staff pretty small few people two three people four yeah something like that**53:21**three or four I guess at this point it's from Husain and Toronto after the 10 th  <br>**Attracting event attendance.53:26**anniversary I tried to organize a Fallout meeting however I had to cancel due to little interest I'll try again at the end of the summer can you think of a**53:31**cost-effective Tim Ferris way to make attendance at these events irresistible**53:37**well you might consider I'm just making this up so this is on the fly but you might consider partnering with another**53:44**organization like EO or YPO or whoever right who might be looking for**53:50**membership and you could say you know I'd love to host this type of event for fans of Tim Ferris or however you want**53:56**phrase it right listeners of the Tim far show or readers of such and such book and perhaps we can do an event**54:04**where they come for free get exposed to these following speakers I think having**54:09**speakers would be helpful so you could try to do that on your own or you could make it more of an**54:17**event right some type of activity so you could do I don't know Tim FIS show**54:22**paintball Extravaganza right get 10 people to go do paintball or something**54:28**who knows right you you have to make it like what are they what are they considering as Alternatives right it's**54:34**kind of like with Molly let's just say my dog Molly I remember at one**54:40**point I was working with this dog trainer and she saw me giving kibble to Molly as the treat just her regular dog**54:47**food but in little pieces and she goes what is that and I was like oh it's kibble she's like oh man she's like**54:52**you're not going to train your dog that way she said it's a crowded bar you got to TI with 20s she's like you're giving**54:57**her [ __ ] you have to have really good treats you have to tip with 20s it's a crowded bar right to compete with**55:04**the squirrels and the dogs and the other stuff the smells so I would say those**55:09**are a few ideas but if you have a small group of friends you could just you could just**55:17**take their temperature with a couple of different options and see how it goes right I mean uh those are a few initial**55:24**thoughts but maybe helpful maybe not Timothy Keen this is visualization or  <br>**Visualization or affirmations?55:30**affirmations I haven't used affirmations much to be honest I don't think actually that's not true with five**55:37**minute journal and things like that kind of these statements like I am or whatever I'll**55:43**also frequently have something like you have plenty of time or there is plenty of time right so that I don't feel**55:51**artificially rushed which never produces great results or great feelings for that matter**55:57**or something like frankly this is true for a lot of people on this Q&A right like you've already won the game you**56:03**speak English you have a computer hopefully you're healthy like**56:09**you've already won the game so just number one like take a breath realize**56:14**there's no game on some level left to win like you've already done it you've already crossed the finish line so**56:19**everything else is gravy so just like take a chill pill and breathe and then for visualiz ation you**56:26**know I use that mostly with athletic stuff uh sometimes if I'm going to get on stage for like a speak engagement**56:32**I'll visualize how it's going to go or I'll run through it visually like just like I have a VR headset on like I'll close my eyes I'm very visual so I'll**56:38**imagine the whole thing walking out sitting in the right chair looking to the audience how I'm going to hold the mic Etc and I'll run through some of**56:45**that as rehearsal let's say those are what come to  <br>**Today I learned this about Hodinkee.56:51**mind yeah check names I didn't realize that hinky was check for watches that's hilarious  <br>**What would this look like if it were easy?56:58**is uh yeah what would this look like if it were easy Cindy question that I still**57:03**ask myself all the time what do I like to ask my this is Victoria ask my fans  <br>**What I ask show listeners when I meet them.57:09**when I meet them I ask who they would like to hear on the podcast you if they could only pick one or two guests and they can't say Elon Musk or some huge**57:15**name no huge names allowed who would you like to have on the podcast that's that's a question I ask and I actually**57:21**have had a lot of those answers translate to guests on the podcast Randy  <br>**Eschewing endorsement remorse.57:26**if we did a fan Meetup would you endorse it or say it's okay I mean this is where I have to be careful about taking on too**57:32**much uh responsibility with these things so probably not because if I did that**57:38**then anyone who's ever hosting a Meetup would come to me for the same thing and it would just create a huge comms problem for me and my my team so I'd**57:45**probably need to be hands off I don't think yeah I mean to have a fan meet**57:51**up I don't think you need my permission uh you know if you're turning into like some crazy business then using**57:58**my name then it turns into a separate thing do I like electronic  <br>**Music I like.58:03**music yes I do I mean I'm pretty old school I mean I listen to shingo Nakamura quite a bit for like chill**58:09**mixes dead mouse pretty old school but I I wrote 4our body to a continuous mix**58:15**like a three-hour set of dead mouse there there's all sorts of stuff but**58:20**it's usually something that's going to give me a fair amount of energy I listen to like lowf beats type stuff when**58:26**writing sometimes if I need something a little downtempo for God knows where listen to a lot of**58:34**like heavy heavy metal when I'm writing oddly enough State story strategy yeah I  <br>**State, story, strategy.58:39**still use State story strategy people can look that up I got that from Tony Robbins I would consider having more  <br>**The (not-so) funny thing about interviewing comedians.58:45**comedians on the podcast but I feel like other people do a better job honestly you know like Rogan there's so many**58:51**comedy podcasts out there I want to differentiate myself in some way that feels authentic to**58:57**me category of one kind of stuff but yes Austin is now a comedy center it's**59:03**pretty wild all right you guys I think that's that's me for now I'm going to get outside and shoot some arrows  <br>**Parting thoughts.59:10**and I really appreciate everyone's time thank you for the hosting first and**59:15**foremost so awesome so fun to see all of these events around the world and would**59:21**love people to stay in touch with anyone they met at those events or look to explore explore see what see what we can**59:28**learn from each other right

bike rides or**59:41**something doesn't have to be coffee and Coffee and Wine get out and do something right try something new together anyway**59:48**that would be that would be my my wish for you

allow the top 1% to get more done in a day than most people get done in a week they're what I use despite having crippling ADHD to become a millionaire by age 27 sell three companies and build $100 million business Empire so without further explaining it these are the 12 ways to be more productive that cost nothing the first hack is to increase your cycle time a couple of years ago I was hiring a bunch of copywriters and I noticed that one of them was 10 times more productive than the other two it was interesting cuz eventually I ended up meeting up with them for a work session and I saw one copywriter type with all 10 figures using hot keys while the others just type with two fingers like fifth graders it never occurred to me that a copywriter wouldn't know how to type the person who is 10 times more productive they also never touched their Mouse they were using hot Keys the whole time which made their output be that much faster the first rule of productivity is to just get faster at the thing you're doing increase the speed of your mouse if you go in there and just fast forward the speed of your mouse it might feel weird at first but you'll eventually get used to it listening to playbacks on any type of audio put it at 1.5 2x just gets faster learning how to type taking typing classes [typing.com](http://typing.com/) learning the hotkeys for your email tool your productivity tool to make sure that everything is just one keyboard click away from getting done an advanced version would be automation with AI think zapier or other tools like it where you can plug into workflows and use the AI to understand what your manual ually doing for it to process it and automate the whole thing so you never have to touch that work again it could be everything from processing comments on your social media to connecting your inbox so that once a day maybe twice a day you get a summary of all your emails using AI to figure out which ones are high priority which one are low with even recommended text to reply to those emails learning how to automate and increase workflow and be productive cost you nothing but improves the cycle time which brings us to number two which is to make a stop doing list when I'm speaking at a Recovery Center or at a group home for troubled youth I always allow the kids to sit in my McLaren and often times they ask so what do you actually do and I usually respond with it's not what I do it's what I don't do most of us are doing things that take up our time and we don't understand this core principle called the 9010 principle it's 10% of your work drives 90% of your results so the key thing is to figure out what are your strengths what are you great at Double Down on those stop trying to become great at something you hate do enough so that it's not a deficit but definitely don't spend all your time trying to take something you hate doing to try to make it something great when you're good at something and go be world class at it also look at all your vices when I say it's what I don't do I don't drink I don't hang out with my friends and talk about other people I don't gamble I don't Vape there's all the stuff I don't do to create the space for me to be more productive I'm also a big fan of finding people that are good at the things I'm bad at and love to do the things I hate there's people out there that literally play at things that I consider work my bookkeeper she would rather sit there and stare at a spreadsheet and reconcile bank accounts than anything else I would hate to do that I'd rather be on the phone talking to people I'd rather be at an event presenting so just understanding there's other people out there that could buy back your time that could help you out you can trade you can ask for favors another idea is to actually make a list of all the things that drain your energy things that you did in the last 6 months that you wish you wouldn't have done make that list be clear and then ask yourself in the future when those opportunities come up I'm going to make sure I immediately say no and it's as simple as a no reviewing the last 6 months and deciding what things you did that you would never want to do and put that on the stop doing list is a good strategy which brings us to number three which is to create urgency I don't know if you can relate but I'm the kind of guy back in the day where I would wait till the last minute to work on a big project either homework for school or big presentation at my work so that I created a sense of urgency to get it done I used to tell myself some weird line about like oh that's when I'm most creative when I have pressure on myself but it turned out it made it really bad for everybody else in my life it meant I didn't prepare and it just created a lot of emotional shrapnel that didn't need to exist this is exactly how I do it today first off is I set an earlier deadline for completion I know I'm making this up in my head that's fine whatever is the due date I make the date sometimes 2 weeks before why because I just want that urgency to focus my creativity that allows me to come prepared to all these big events in my life if it's prepping for a podcast I'm going on or working on my book deadlines or whatever it is is I'd rather have the date way sooner that it's needed so that I also have the breathing room to be more creative and more inspired another strategy I love to use is to block time in my calendar usually about 90 minutes per project and what I'll do is I'll set a timer I like to use a Pomodoro Timer which is 25 minutes of focused work and then 5 minutes off to refresh to use the bathroom to get some water and then it goes off and I'm back at it again whatever project I'm working on if I put that block time those 90 minutes in my calendar and I do three sessions of that Pomodoro it helps me overcome my ADHD it focuses is me and because the timer is counting down it's like every 5 minutes I'm like how much did I get done how much did I get done it's almost up it's almost up and it just focus me to get the most work and makes me more creative and more resourceful and doesn't waste my time which brings us to number four which is to commit to others this one very few people use and it's one that I use almost on a daily basis I remember when I was writing my book I tried three times the first time I sat down and said oh I'm going to commit to writing every morning and for 3 weeks I sat there and I wrote and I wrote and I had no process and no purpose and honestly I didn't even know what the book was going to be about then I tried again and I figured you know what maybe I should do this different and I had a friend help me out with the outline but the problem was I was still doing it on my own by the time I gave it my third shot I realized I need somebody else to be committed to so first thing is I hired a person that became my book CEO this person managed me as the talent to be accountable to them second is I hired another writing partner that way I had somebody that was waiting for me on my writing and then I also had somebody that was an editor where we would schedule time together to review the work as a team and on that call we would do the work of writing the book without that I probably wouldn't have created the type of work I did because having somebody else that is a co-creator a collaborator somebody to bring different creative ideas it actually made the whole process fun and I now use that strategy in all the different areas of my life from doing paperwork I don't want to do to creative ideation with some new content ideas with my team to strategic planning instead of doing it solo I always invite one or two other people to collaborate with even when I had no money I would just call a friend and ask them if they wanted to do like joint working sessions sometimes we'd meet up at a coffee shop other times we would just connect over Zoom they have accountability to me because I'm sharing my screen and then we' just set a timer we check in with each other and we just make sure that hey whatever project we said we would move forward we committed to that person cuz it turns out you will do more for other people than you'll ever do for yourself just think about your dog I mean if your dog's sick you're like the world stops and we get that dog healed up and all the medication we give 100% completion of whatever pills the doctor says whereas for you you will go long periods of time sometimes not feeling good without ever taking care yourself let alone if you get medication maybe you'll finish 60 70% of it so understand committing to other people is actually a very powerful tool to keep us focused and be really accountable which brings us to number five which is the schedule time to recharge I'm not proud of this but I used to be the person that would work a 100 hour weeks I would just get up crank ignore everything else ignore my health ignore my friends ignore my relation relationships because I was just doing whatever I could to try to be successful and it did create momentum the challenge is it also created bad momentum because I didn't take the time to recharge to reset and the energy was frantic which means there was no space for what I call step functions of growth ideas so now I have a completely different approach and here's how I think about it just like I have blocked time for work I also have blocked time for rest see the magic that I've discovered is in the reset we are one creative idea away from having our whole life change think about it could be that book idea it could be that idea to call a friend could be a conversation with somebody that you didn't even plan and what I've discovered is the world works this way there's two different systems no matter who you are think about the ying and yang there's a sympathetic system which is fight ORF flight and then there's the parasympathetic system which is to relax and to chill out there's the anabolic system which takes protein to build muscle and then there's a catabolic system that eats the protein there's UST stress and then there's distress UST stress is when you decide to do something hard and you push on the World to Change and distress is when you feel like the world is pushing on you and it makes it hard understanding that if you want to be the most productive the most creative the most expansive that you have to have some push and also some time to pull some drive and also some reset I now have cut off time for when I finish my work because I know my brain's not going to work well after that no good decisions going to be made and I also understand how my body and my energy flows so for example I'll go sit in the hot tub and just sit there on my phone and outline new video ideas or reach out to friends I haven't seen in a while or think about creative ideas of things I might want to do over the next 6 months it's understanding that you can't always be going charge charge charge because it's actually in the reset where you create the space that makes the creativity and the big needle moving decisions come to life I've learned over the years that vacations make me a better person for my team for my family so when I go away and I go mountain biking with my friends or I take my family and we go to somewhere is when I come back I just feel energized I feel that I've got more life to give other people and it turns out that if you're building businesses with other people you have Partners you have customers you have vendors those conversations are going to be a lot more fun when you've reset yourself you've new energy you're recharged to attack your work I think most people feel guilty taking time off they think anytime I'm not working or I'm not showing up for my team that I'm just one second away where something massive is going to implode on my life and it makes it really hard for them to unplug where the opposite is actually true it's kind of like a pressure cooker if you work 100 hours a week and you don't take any time off eventually that pressure cooker is going to overflow and you may think that you're good but your body will start going into adrenal fatigue you'll have anxiety attacks I've seen people break out into shingles they've got these little sore spots that start breaking out on their skin and that's literally their body telling them they have not reset they've not created any self-care in their life you can't Redline your body Non-Stop and it not be upset with you productivity is being able to stay consistent for long periods of time without having to reset because you went too far which brings us to number six which is to wake up early this one is going to be controversial but early risers make more money period full stop if you look at any person that's ever succeeded from Church Hill to you know Steve Jobs they get up earlier than most people now I'm not saying you have to join the 500 a.m. Club but I'm not saying you shouldn't if you're getting up at 8:30 9:00 you might want to consider changing your whole day to start earlier because when you can get up before everybody else does you will be connected to an energy that very few people ever experien there's actually a spiritual concept around the 4:00 a.m. time frame now you don't have to get up that early but you should at some point try it out and really attack the work do creative things I get 4 hours every day from 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. where I get some very deep work some creative projects to really move my dreams and goals forward because I'm up that early does that mean I go to bed early yep I do I'd rather wake up early connected to my Creator and really plug in to the availability of the world because everybody else is sleeping it's like a different brain wave that's going on it's quiet nobody's interrupting me no distractions then not have that massive boost in productivity and it carries it on for the rest of the day getting up early is productivity 101 so just start with 15 minutes every week just a little bit earlier a little bit earlier you'll reset the clock and one day you'll realize man this isn't even hard anymore just who you are in those morning hours you will come up with ideas that will transform your whole life which brings us to number seven which is to eat that frog now there's a whole book on this by Brian Tracy so it's not a New Concept but most people tend to mess this up all the time essentially before you do anything do the most important thing I always think about the leading Domino what's the most important project typically the thing I least want to do but I know if I do that first that it's going to set me up for the rest of the day essentially it's the project that is is going to guarantee me success Marketing sales focused Revenue driven opportunities for you to get in front of new people so anything that kind of gives you angst but it's a meaningful project I want you to start with that first it might be working out cuz that's hard for you it could be reading a book it could be reaching out to people it could be learning a new language whatever you need to do to really upgrade your life you want to start with that in the morning so that you build that momentum for the rest of the day for some people they'll just make a list of all their big task for the day and as soon as they're done it they'll just call their day complete and I like that idea too so just make a list and as fast as you can get through everything eventually your day is done and then you can do whatever you want with the rest of it but eat that frog first it might be to get 1 hour of studying for that big test send out emails to people you've been meaning to connect with those cold calls obviously time zones matter but you just want to get the hardest thing the biggest rock the Frog eaten first do it first thing in the morning most people like put off the thing because they want to get ready to start it's like I'm not ready I need my coffee I need my energy I need this I need my crystals I need my Tim yeah you need some stuff but just start the work there's no better answer than just doing the thing which brings us to number eight which is to follow your energy flow I used to be the person that would take meetings all the time if somebody can only meet at 8:00 a.m. okay let's talk then or if I had to create some content it's like when can I fit it into my schedule and it's like all right end of the day 4:30 I guess that's all I got 30 minutes the challenge is it turns out that the energy that I have throughout my day shifts and changes and the type of energy I need for certain types of work is different and if I mix them up then those tasks those projects are not going to get the best version of me I look at how my energy is going to flow from the early morning to the late morning to the lunch to the early afternoon to the late afternoon and I map the activities or the projects to that so for example for me I start my day with creative tasks things that require kind of uh unique perspectives ideation outlining stuff writing creating designing that is my morning I'm super blessed to be able to do all of that before I ever have a meeting usually not till 11:00 a.m. throughout the day so I put me first my big projects first and then I put all of my conversations Etc in the afternoon if I got to create content I like to do it right after I work out why there's something about getting a workout in and then going to shoot content where I feel really good about how I'm feeling and how it comes across on the camera everybody's different I'm more of a morning person other people people might be a night person I had little kids that became human alarm clocks so I had to restructure my whole day but knowing your energy how it flows for you in batching those projects that require that energy together will change your productivity overnight which brings us to number nine which is a create something to run away from whether you believe this or not most people do more to avoid pain than to gain pleasure so this is just how we're wired as humans we're always trying to look for the danger out in the world and try to avoid it so if you make up some kind of thing to avoid it will Propel you forward because you're trying not to experience that so for example when I wanted to lose 30 lb in 90 days I created some Stakes I created the downside if I didn't achieve that goal and for me I chose to enter in a fitness competition as I would look no shaving chest No Tan no super lean I just wherever that competition was if I didn't hit my goal immediately entry immediately on stage all my friends watching recorded for life that was the Stak so do you think that I didn't hit that goal or I absolutely crushed it I mean the stakes were so high I had something to avoid to run away from using this idea for yourself strategically is the most productive thing you could do maybe there's a political campaign you would hate to donate to and if you don't hit your timeline you don't hit your goal you have to donate $500 ,000 to that political campaign and like really honor it and follow through with it I mean some people if they were trying to get healthy just the commitment to themselves that they will publish a photo of themselves in their underwear on their social media is enough fear of embarrassment to run away from to go get that result so just think about it for yourself I think that if I want to be productive I need a downside thing to avoid to drive away from to get my result which brings us to number 10 which is to get a carrot on the stick this is essentially the opposite of my previous point this way you'll double your motivation think about it if there's a stake or something at risk if I don't hit it what's my reward if I do hit it implementing rewards for your goals is a game Cher when it comes to being productive when I was training for my Iron Man I had a family vacation on the line if I didn't finish the Iron Man so I told my wife when we were out eating at a restaurant do you think she asked me if I wanted dessert no she's like you have to train tomorrow when I told her I had to get up early with a bunch of friends did she give me a hard time no because she knew what was on the line even enrolling other people to that reward will help them create positive peer pressure on you to achieve that outcome in those situations I like to create it where it's not just a reward for me but it's a reward for my family for my team members for my friends so that they get behind supporting me on my goal and it always comes back that you'll always do more for other people than you'll ever do for yourself so create the reward that helps them as well so that everybody wins which brings us to number 11 which is to honor your schedule I can directly correlate someone's net worth to the increment of time they schedule into their their calendar it's bananas to me most people do not plan do not put things in their calendar every day is an opportunity for I don't know whatever I feel like or every week is I don't know whatever happens and it's crazy because it's the difference between a Life by Design versus a Life by default if you can just understand that putting the big rocks the Pebbles the sand into your calendar first before the rest of the water and the other demands on your time come in will allow you to be more productive than anybody else you know the key though is is to honor the calendar not contact switch not dismiss the notification not pretend like it's not there first thing in the morning for you to attack but sometimes you're working on something you didn't finish it so if you didn't just move it to the next time block maybe to the next day or maybe to the afternoon one of my favorite Concepts is this thing called Parkinson's law I was just sharing it with a friend the other day CU she asked somebody to get something done and the person said while get it done at the end of the week I said why didn't you ask for it to get done tomorrow they said well I don't know I go well that's the difference between 4 days in one day and she's like I didn't want to be that person I said well you could at least asked Parkinson's law states the work will expand to the time you allocate to it and that's true for your calendar it's true for other people momentum is about stacking small wins so if you start doing what you say when you're going to do it is going to build that confidence because you're keeping the commitments you made to yourself in private so build that discipline which brings us to number 12 which is to turn off all notifications on your phone some of you guys are like no way Dan I'm not not doing this and I'm going to tell you there are professional PhD doctorate employees working at all these tech companies building all this software that their only job is to distract you and when I think of the most unproductive thing you could possibly do is allow the notifications the apps to interrupt you when you are doing something that you decided was important to you just because somebody else somewhere in the world sent you a message your focus is worth more than somebody else's notification remember one time I was messaging with one of my new employees and he would always reply always reply always reply and I sat down with them when our 101 and I shared with them I said hey I love that you want to be on top of things and respond to me right away but that also tells me that you're easily interrupted if you're doing it with me you're probably doing with other people which means I'm not getting your best work because I'm not getting your focus work your head's down deep in the zone work so I'm going to need you to batch those activities into one block time so that if you need to reply to me just sit down and look at your all text messages and reply and then get back to your next project most people will never do this because they are addicted to the dopamine hits of those notifications but to do your best work you have to get into Flow State and to do that you need to get lost in your work not distracted by those notifications most people are on their phone all day not working because it's an illusion of productivity responding to people's messages feels like you're doing something but you're not getting anything done you're staying busy but you're not creating you're not producing you're not pushing a project forward you're just moving a bunch of information it's not that it doesn't have to get responded to but stacking that and doing it on your own time instead of allowing an app to bug you is going to be a game changer for productivity if you want to learn the 44 cheat codes I know at 44

a massive part of healing because that's when you're holding on to that negative energy and emotion and you're just like in that victimhood where you're blaming this person that wronged you and if that's in your body it's lowering your frequency and and disrupting your healing so all of that to say it's in the science it's in the research clinical data the people who don't heal are holding on to negative emotion and it's it's a necessary part of [Music] healing greetings and welcome to the Dr Espen podcast I am Espen today I am a privileged to have a conversation with a person that has put together some works that I believe has truly changed the way we understand health and healing uh Kelly nun garez has been in the health uh game and in the Consciousness game for many many years and today we're going to have a conversation revolving how we can improve our health expand our Consciousness and take as I say our energy frequency and vibration to a whole new level so let me start the official introduction I'm really I'm excited about where this can go today uh Kelly gz is an entrepreneur she's a writer director and producer she gained recognition for her award-winning documentary heel they came out out in 2017 I'm sure many of you would have seen that highlights these nine different steps of health and healing that I honestly believe that without that you're not going to be able to obtain Optimal Health so we're going to talk a little bit about these principles today and we're going to talk about some very simple very inexpensive yet remarkably powerful steps that you can take right now to improve the health and and the overall well-being for you and for the whole family so that heel movie came out in 2017 uh and it explores the Mind Body connection this is very important the the Mind Body Connection the psychosomatic aspect of our own health and well-being and our body's natural capabilities to heal all right and then in 2019 she came out with the book heel and now she's got the podcast as well which we'll talk a little bit about now for heel specifically I remember I was watching this and I was saying to Kelly just before we jumped on I was just covered in truth bumps watching this because I was uh really quite uh grateful that someone had put together a a compilation of such amazing works I mean that included from from memory we had deepack Choo we had Bruce Lipton in there uh we had a lot of experts around the world that came together Maron Williamson was in there um and shared about their understanding of Health um Kelly's born and raised in La she's been traveling all over the world been in the industry uh of entertainment she since she was 7 years old she's on the environmental and sustainability board uh of at UCLA to help healing the planet and the list goes on and on and on Kelly I as I said I'm excited to have this conversation I want to say special welcome to the podcast how are you today thank you I'm doing well so I'm excited to hang out and chat let's do it okay so the topics we could discuss you know spirituality Consciousness healing all that sort of stuff I want to ask firstly what inspired you to get thought leaders in the so called alternative medicine holistic medicine field together and not just some of them but I think Dr Michael Beckwith was in there you got some of the leading experts in the world in this field together in this movie heel what inspired you to put together that yeah it's a lifelong journey so there's no one like aha that made me go I need to make this film But ultimately you know all of the teachers in the film empowered me to understand that we have way more power over our health and our lives and we've kind of been led to believe you know and I don't think there any like Sinister Force that's like leading us down the wrong path but just the way society and systems have evolved kind of you know we give our power away and so when I started learning about quantum physics and energy and Law of Attraction and you know just deepening my spiritual understanding and I just was like oh my gosh everybody needs to know this and then and I read the biology of belief by Bruce Lipton which is explores epigenetics which basically tells us that our genes are just a blueprint our DNA uh a blueprint of potentials you know and then our environment and our perception of the environment which means our subconscious programming beliefs color the lens and actually uh turn toggle on and off jeans so we have that's kind of like in spiritual terms in scientific terms free will that we can choose whether we want to turn on the good jeans or the bad jeans Etc so when I learned that I was like oh my gosh everybody needs to know this and I essentially you know people would come up to me and say why are you so happy how are you manifesting all this stuff what do you eat what do you do what's your workout and I was like I've just got to put all my teachers that empowered me into a film and and so became he and there we are so ladies gentlemen if you haven't seen heel I think it's on Netflix as well Kelly is that correct it was on Netflix for two years we've been on Amazon Prime now for a couple years so yeah yeah the Amazon Prime comes out with big budgets don't they okay so jump on Amazon Prime and and watch the movie heel and as I did many many years ago I think this is what 2019 I watched it and I was like yes yes yes yes and I kind of did an audit of my personal life you know if we talk about nutrition herbs and spices talk about emotional healing which I'd like to talk to in a moment I've specialized in in clearing in emotional buckes and how that has affected the body so I want to get into that but I basically used the the documentary not only as inspiration but also as a checklist and I went through and I audited my life and I looked at it and I thought and I asked myself where am I not in in in full you know potential with these different topics and it actually gave me a really good blueprint to take my energy to the next level so I'd like to talk a little bit about this this healing aspect because I know that you're really big on this and I've also specialized in this and I'd love your take it we talk about stress mental physical spiritual emotional and chemical stress but as we know it's one of the few if not the only thing that's related to every single chronic disease that we can see so if we understand stress from today's aspect most people are living in fight or flight how bad and or dangerous is it really for us to live in fight or flight yeah it's detrimental to our health and vitality and Longevity ultimately because we are you know just to take it down to very rudimentary terms our nervous system is either in fight ORF flight which is meant to make us superum to either hunt for our food or you know fight Flee for our lives so it's this you know stress response that makes us very strong focused energized but it's only meant to be turned on for that survival period of either either escaping a predator uh or an enemy or you know going after our food so it's a survival thing you know back in the day it's turned on for a short period of time so we can you know survive and then it's meant to be turned off and the other side of that is the parasympathetic nervous system response and that's when we're resting we're basically healing resting rejuvenating and and restoring all of our body systems so if we are in fight or flight chronically which is what is happening in the state of the world with the inundation of a 24-hour news cycle we have not evolved quickly enough to keep up with this inundation with in information most of it negative and fear inducing fear inciting stressful um and violent and just dark we haven't evolved to to be able to process that amount of information so that's putting us in these like kind of chronic stress response Cycles which just in a very logical sense we cannot rest and repair and do all these things that our body needs to do to process the toxins in our environment to rest in repair and to do all the things that was designed to do and that's what's hindering that's what's you know one of the main issues of why we have this chronic illness epidemic yes there's toxins yes there's all sorts of you know bad food and processed food and all these things that are contributing to that but at the very minimum if we're not able to rest and repair we're just we're going down with the ship and so that's that stresses everything I mean it's really the basis of why we're all conically ill today it's interesting as you mention that because I've had the privilege of owning 10 multi-disciplinary health clinics and hiring and recruiting and managing a lot of different you know chiropractors naturopaths medical doctors and dentists over the years and if we were to really survey all of our patients and ask what is the core problem what is it that links every one together in terms of pathology and disease it would defin Ely be stressed yet it seems that many people are Their Own Worst Enemy we tend to be on the treadmill of life and in the rat race and not stop until we either one get that this is actually very detrimental or two we have a scare a health scare or something so just urging those out there to kind of tune in to where your nervous system might be at right now are you in fight or flight I mean speaking from experience I've had adrenal fatigue and burnout three times as an entrepreneur trying to you know get to that next stage or whatever and it is remarkably painful and it's better to take charge on your health and wellbeing now and I know Kelly you've been a vivid meditator and and and and and uh practicer of these tools for many years so just for everyone watching and listening what is your relationship to stress how are you mastering your life your emotions and your stress levels by taking time out nurturing yourself eating clean meditating um journaling praying whatever it is that you're doing so I'd love to give you little tips and tools and accountability measures throughout the podcast so you can just right away take control on your health Kelly you know what something that you've spoken about I really love your opinion on and we're going to get to the whole expansion of consciousness conversation soon I'm just itching and excited but before we do I want to talk about emotions okay this is so big in the movie heal and it's not the only work that you've done I love it and by the way we'll talk about Kelly's podcast soon you got to go check out this podcast and you obviously got to go watch the the movie as well but in the movie here there's there's a specific link and you talk about negative emotions and unres olved trauma I call them issues in the tissues from your experience can you tell me what what effect does negative emotions and unresolved trauma have on both one our health and two our quality of life please I mean it all ties back to stress so if we have a lot of us are not given the tools to process trauma and deep pain in the moment so what we do our body goes into shock and kind of we repress and suppress that intense emotion it's the feeling the energy of the feeling is too painful too terrifying you know whatever that trauma was that occurred we aren't we don't have the capacity to process it in the moment so that energy gets stored somewhere in the body and that disrupts flow that disrupts life force energy Chi whether it's the chakra system or traditional Chinese medicine all of these ancient wisdom it all goes back to the same thing it's a blockage of energy in the body body so it gets stored in your issues really do get stored in the tissues which then blocks energy when you don't have that energy flow and vitality you know things manifest into disease and physical the physical is always the last place that it will show up and express so I always go back and I love you know because I yes I'm very spiritual I'm very woooo but you've got to be based in science and I think that we're at a time in history where spirituality is kind of being demonstrated and proven through science so it's very exciting in the film there's a researcher named Dr Kelly Turner who her research is specifically tied to cancer which has a you know very like clear emotional route many of the times um and there's you know over 200 causes of cancer cancer is a very complex chronic disease but she researched all of like 1500 cases of spontaneous healing radical remission because when they were doing her she was doing her research she was like wait these like anomalies that they just keep tossing to the side of these people that healed were sent home to die and then all of a sudden they're not dead 20 years later from an you know they had Pancreatic Cancer all these incurable cancers she's like we should be studying them we shouldn't be discounting them as anomalies we should be studying what they did so she studied 1,500 cases and found out that all of these people who were sent home to dive of terminal incur you know air quotes incurable Cancer all did nine things this was at the point when the film came out now she added movement because she went back and looked at a research and they all did some sort of movement most of it was like walking but it was like walking or yoga so there's movement in there so the other nine things um two of them were physical which is radically changing your diet and using herbs and supplements and the other seven uh were mental emotional and and spiritual and that blew me away Kelly when I saw the movie I'm like I'm expecting the nutrition and a bit of movement and a bit of that and I'm like two out of nine is physical and I remember I wrote it down and I'm like what is going on and now we get to go deep so back to you this is exciting yeah and you're an energy guy so you get this like it's so much easier to shift the energy than to shift the matter and the matter is the diet and the the herbs and supplements um and the movement obviously shifts energy too but so one of them is is clearing and releasing negative emotions one of them is increasing positive emotions so emotions again is energy and motion it's feeling it's energy so so she just learned that they they all did some form of trauma healing and forgiveness and another expert in the film Joan Boris senko all of these experts have been doing this kind kind of holistic approach to healing and holistic is not woooo holistic is looking at the body as a whole system and not just like attacking you know one area and not realizing that it's connected to all the other systems of the body so like you give a pill for organ or system a it's going to throw there's going to be a downward consequence it's going to throw off the other system so it's like you have to look at the human body as a whole system in it everything's you know interconnected so anyways all of that to say Joan Bor senko said she was running since the like early 80s a a holistic Cancer Clinic and she said the ones who didn't heal 100% of the time were all holding on to regrets or resentments which is why forgiveness is such a massive part of healing because that's when you're holding on to that negative energy and emotion and you're just like in that victim Ood where you're blaming this person that wronged you and you're just a if that's in your body it's lowering your frequency and and disrupting your healing so all of that to say it's in the science it's in the research clinical data that people who don't heal are holding on to negative emotion and it's it's a necessary part of you I feel this is a microp moment I just want to take this opportunity to kind of let listeners and viewers kind of tune into that what are you holding on to what resentment judgment bitterness um regret guilt shame anger are you holding on to and the old expression I think it's pertinent here you know um being angry and Andor experiencing these emotions is like drinking poison and expecting someone else to be affected by it um there are methods there are tools there are amazing resources such as Kell's work and heel and and her podcast and some of the work that I do they can actually help you with this they can actually help you take a good look in the mirror and and realize that as I teach life never happened to you it always happened for you so I want to share a hypothesis with you Kelly because this is just mindboggling I U graduated 20 209 and retired 2016 I was burnt out I was unhappy um I was very corporately successful but I was sick and I was say mostly emotionally sick because I had not taken or given myself the opportunity to heal the unresolved troll in my body and in my mind from childhood my brother passed away my sister was disabled and that was difficult both my parents are alcoholics and so on and so forth and so I realized then that hang on you know so much of how we experience life is unconscious or subconscious and so I did what some people would do I just retired from clinical practice I had a lot of money I went to Peru I started drinking iasa and some other things it's been a very interesting Journey since my point being I remember once I was sitting in the jungle in Peru and I experienced this blue light this colar around my throat and when I tuned into my life I realized that there were some things in my life that I wasn't resonating with anymore there were people that I uh wasn't right for me to be in a relationship with there were things that I had been doing that wasn't right for me anymore and then as I started to study this to understand myself I came about an ancient blueprint from the Indian lineage and the bagita and the yoga Traditions um that showed that certain emotions block the different energy sent all the chakras and at the time I was a you know I had three degrees in science and I looked at it and I thought this is a bit woo woo isn't it but because I had some experience in yoga and and my intuition pulled me and I know you're big on intuition I started researching this and then I realized that fear and this is again the blueprint I didn't discover this I just kind of put the pieces together fear blocks the root Energy Center the first chakra guilt blocks the second shame blocks the third grief blocks the fourth lies block the fifth and so on and so forth so I thought to myself what if there's something in this so what I did is I wrote a curriculum it's called Quantum Advanced and it takes three days and we go through the clearing process and what we do is we help people identify their primary fear their greatest fear and then turn it into something productive from Fear to fuel and then we go through guilt and we can clear guilt we go through shame and we can clear shame um and and what happens over time is that there is this change of of how we hold our internal energy and I have to agree with what you said before because then our students and the people going through this they don't feel like drinking alcohol or eating crap food because they feel so great and often what we realize is that these vices these addictions come from not feeling good so I want to I want to ask you firstly have you uh what's your understanding let's go a little bit deeper into energy centers chakras and emotional imbalances as such and your uh I I guess experience in the effects on the body specifically what are your thoughts yeah I mean I I totally I've never heard the emotional blocks like You' you've put them so I'm like I need to go through your three-day program there's all sorts of healing in my chart which is not shocking right but I didn't know that before I did heal um all I know is that I seek truth I want to understand this like insatiable desire to understand the way things work so I've done every like healing you know mod ality and I continue to find things and then I experience them and I share them so that other people can you know find but you know I recently did a plant medicine journey and there was this and the the woman the shaman took me through this like mirror work and we connect I like went through and this wasn't what she was you know intending but the experience that I had is I I looked and saw in the mirror me between the ages of like 12 and 14 and I had like completely disconnected at that time from this part of me you know and I'm like look and I'm like thinking like was there something traumatic that happened that caused this disassociation or this disconnect but anyways the amount of healing that occurred by just witnessing and it was something I wasn't conscious of but there was just this like point in my life where I just kind of disconnected with a a part of myself and so in that time I reconnected to myself and like the amount of energy I have since that moment it was like there's just so many things that happen in our life that disconnect us you know and I'm not being very articulate but as you're talking about the chakras is like there's blocks there's fragments and for me it's just like all healing is wholeness it's it's coming back to your whole self and so part you know it's energy it's it's trauma it's you know and it's something that we do on our own but sometimes we need these facilitators and these you know exogenous you know experiences that can reflect back where we've just kind of disconnected from ourselves if that Mak makes sense and so yeah I think this is an important point because you know if you and I say this to my students sometimes imagine this you go uh online to your you know AI tool or just Google or whatever and you you look up what percentage of my atoms are made up of empty space and the answer scientifically proven since MOX plunk won the Nobel Prize for this over 100 years ago is 99 plus per empty space so we are made up of 99% pure untapped energy potential so the fact that we're playing at this very surface level of healing equals physical means that we're playing with less than 1% of our true healing potential just scientifically proven so I just want to point out what Kelly is speaking about here is not woo woo this is actual science it may feel woooo and it certainly did to me many years ago but this journey has been one of the greatest discoveries of my life and so I want to go a little bit deeper into this because now we're talking about understanding energy and Consciousness understanding who we really are and I think a useful tool that I've shared with my students is asking the question who am I in the first place and so then most people would say I am energy I am Consciousness I am matter I am spirit I am Source whatever and we know that scientifically true and so then it's not just that we are the body or the mind we are The Observers of the body and the mind and as such then we can change anything within that realm this puts the power back in our reality and and often you know students if they say that they go through healing let's say that we talk about regret like Kelly brought up before and we have regret because we heard someone or we lied to someone or someone deceived us or hurt us if we hold on to that we know that we're going to get sick all right we heard the results from do Turner's work earlier with the psychosomatic aspect of this but I think when people uh when we give ourselves permission to remember who we are as in I am Consciousness then life didn't happen to us it happened for us we are experiencing this reality we are not the sickness we are experiencing signs and symptoms of disease that doesn't mean we are sick there's a very big difference okay so I just wanted to put that out there because if you know who you are as in I am you know Consciousness well you have every tool in the entire toolbox to change your life how exciting okay Kelly let's talk Consciousness is interesting I mean we've been through Co we've been through a lot of crazy things uh and I think that the darker the dark the brighter the light what are your thoughts on the expansion uh and the evolution of human consciousness what's happening now on a collective level I believe we're like experiencing a breakdown before a breakthrough if that makes sense so it feels like it feels like there is an energy I don't you know there's the age of Aquarius that we're stepping into there's the frequency of the earth like all yeah it's like it's I I'm feeling all of it I'm witnessing all of it and systems are breaking down there's there's a lot of inflammation uh in society in the global Collective right so and and just and the way we're treating the planet like all of these systems and and our and our mentality and our kind of cons you know rabid consumption is it's not none of this is sustainable so to me I believe like you said the darker the dark the lighter the light I I and I believe in physics it's like there's an equal and opposite reaction in spirituality so as as much as there's and it's been throughout time and throughout history so you know with when there's this kind of negative Bend to what we're experiencing witnessing there's also just this equal and opposite it's just that's how the cosmos stay in Balance right I I don't know if I'm making any sense but to me it just feels like I'm watching a bad movie but with all that I've learned I can remove myself and as I'm looking I'm sitting in the mountains in Aspen Colorado and like there is so much Beauty still happening in the world and in N like nature just self-corrects we are part of nature so as I just encourage everybody to just kind of keep pulling back perspective keep opening the aperture it's so easy to get hooked especially with social media and everything else um into the negative but if we can just like breathe and pull back and it's you know it's a fine balance you want to be engaged you want to be an activist for things that are not just and things that are wrong in the world that you're passionate about however also it's like it's on us to be happy and present and grateful there's so much to be grateful for you know there's like so it's it's F you know it's on that individual level we're all healing like your podcast your work my work you there's just it's that equal and opposite for all the that's breaking down in the world and the systems and the corrupt politicians and you know pandemics and whatever like there's also so much Beauty and truly even though it seems super gnarly what's going on in the state of the world like we're doing we're like very blessed as a as a as a generation meaning technology like there's there's Wars there's suffering there's awful awful horrific things that happen every day but compared to like medieval times and to you know like we're and the Great Depression like we're doing okay you know so we're we just have to continue to you know be the change you wish to see in the world is probably one of the wisest things things that you could do it's like as we heal ourselves we are part of this Collective frequency right we are as we change our frequency we're sending out new information into the field collectively for all the people that are meditating for all the people that are doing the work that's expanding the energy in the field in the positive direction you know so I'm a you know I'm a hopeless Optimist but I'm I'm feeling good about this conversation and you know all of the people listening you know we're we're on the right side of History so I love that there's a lot of trust and faith in that and and I absolutely agree if you look back at the the past we are certainly living in very very blessed times and I think now speaking for myself it's a time to prepare and I'm not preparing from any aspect of fear or or worry or concern I'm preparing for an aspect of purifying my body because I do believe that we're entering higher states of consciousness and I do know that my vessel my body my temple must be able to hold and or assimilate these energies so I want to just quickly ask what are some of the top things that you're doing in your life right now to not just you know expand your own Consciousness and live a magical life I mean you're a mom you're a snowboarder you're you're an activist for amazing things to help the planet what are some of the things that you're focusing on now moving forward in your life yeah I love what you just said it's like we have to with this raise raising of the frequency you know I am held to more account to like this vessel you know because I'm so like I just came off of four days of a headache and and talking to other people it felt very like so like massive solar flares like my friend tracks the Schuman resonance meter and she was like this is going charts you know she like sending it to me I'm like what does this mean I don't know all I know is that I'm exhausted and I have a headache for no reason and why are they cutting out I mean you go back and you look at you follow the Schuman resonance you understand the what's happening with the waves of energy coming into the atmosphere but then it looks like they're cutting out parts of it there's certainly information bits of information missing so either they're missing it or they're hiding something it's interesting to see but we do know there's a lot of light entering the atmosphere I just wanted to put that in there back to you yeah so I mean so you're this is tracking with you because there was no reason why I should have a headache for four days that Advil and I don't I like it it pains me to take Advil like I'll take Advil on the third day of a headache and headaches debilitate me and with a 5-year-old it's like you can't you have to be able to function so I I think I took Advil like the end of the second day and it barely did anything and I'm just like this is like this is external this is not normal and and you know it was hormonal not to give too much information but it was like in line with my cycle but that's rare to have a headache and then there's this blue super moon full moon so all of that to say I think we as human beings these organisms were getting more sensitive and infiltrated with this raising of the frequency higher energy more light coming into the atmosphere whatever so we do have to be a little bit more diligent in our practices so that we can hold the space and I you know this may go a little too woooo or or real but I there's a lot of people not being able to sustain this frequency and they're choosing to leave the planet whether it's through overdose suicide it's like it is it's it's intensifying you know so even we're like we're pretty conscious and we're aware of what's going on and like I have to be I can't like I have to like drink less alcohol get more sleep you know I I just have to like do do better so that my my vessel can can handle it and it's it's it is and I'm just like you know the the uh rebellious teenager in me is like no I'm still young and I can handle this but it's like no I will like I can feel the shift so for me all of that to say my biggest thing is like of course I lean into my meditation practice but I just have to get closer to Nature like I think one of our biggest issues is disconnecting from disconnection from nature whether it's the cycles of sleep and light and dark and we're on this like unsustainable pace of life to keep up with the Joneses and be successful it's like no we need to go to sleep when the Sun goes down you know shortly therea we need to rise with the sun we need to eat seasonally in season and local all of that is making much more it has a lot more it's like we can't not do that anymore you know what I mean and getting my feet into the Earth um getting that early morning sun just being in the trees so that's my antidote right now is like getting into nature as much as possible H we are nature and so when we do wear rubber Souls all day we don't get sun on our skin we eat food like products rather than real food and we don't actually get to sit on the ground and and and you know breathe a meditate or Journal we are disconnected not only from our mother but from ourselves and I think this is extremely important to understand mother nature always corrects herself you mentioned that so beautifully Kelly and that means that we also have that innate intelligence to do just the same where are you not giving yourself mission to go out in nature and be still to to to you know swim in the oceans to to swim in the rivers to to do whatever this is extremely important I think really getting reconnected again with that 7.8 Herz frequency of the earth and when you're on the earth that that resonance will go through your beingness this is this is not anything new we know about this um so I'm I'm really excited about this and you've provided us with some really good insights to some very powerful tools um and of course guys you know go and check out the the movie heel and before we move on let me just do this right now this is this is for all you guys watching and listening pen and paper take a note firstly heal withth [ky.co](http://ky.co/) okay that's the website hewi [ky.co](http://ky.co/) o at Instagram it's heal with Kelly Allin one word that's Instagram heal with Kelly Allin one word and also Kelly gorz G RS so go and check out heel go and check out Kelly's work definitely jump on the podcast I would be delighted to jump on yours and have a deep dive whatever topic you want to go um but for now guys you're coming on you're for sure oh you're on okay it's on okay that I'm honored thank you um for now listeners and viewers use these resources to get inspired look at what in your life is not serving you anymore maybe put it to the side get out in nature and see what happens just give it 30 days and you'll notice a big change in yourself and and a perhaps even a reconnection to not only nature but also to Consciousness and spirit um Kelly I want to ask you um a couple of questions before we wrap up and I think this is one of the most important questions for me looking at my life what do you think now if we observe ourselves uh and we start to tune in you mentioned before when we change ourselves when we take care of ourselves on an individual level it's going to have an impact on the field all right so and I remember once I asked someone uh someone asked me excuse me you know what's going to happen in the world and my answer was if you asked that question you may not be a leader what do you think are some of the um decisions that we can make some of the standards maybe that we can apply in our lives to ensure that we're walking the right path uh into the into the future yeah I I think it's very important now especially with the rise of AI and the doctoring of images and just you know just capture of governments and big political machines and you know I'm not I'm not a conspiracy theorist I just like have learned a lot so you're realist think I get it yeah I'm a realist it's like yeah it's it's pretty lat at this day and age so I think you know one of the one of Kelly Turner's again this is her research from 10 years ago still applies today of those nine key Essentials to Healing now it's 10 with movement one of them is tapping into your intuition and I think the biggest thing right now is having practices so that you can tune in you the unique listener that there's never been anyone like you ever in the history and never in this moment in time right now you are a unique beautiful person that is here to share their gifts um and you have an internal guidance system that is directly from Source your higher self your soul whatever you want to call it constantly giving you guidance and Truth through the interpretation of this incredible mechanism called the human body that's why I think you said the cutest term I've ever heard with this truth bumps I've never heard that before we call them Goosebumps on this side of the hemisphere but like truth bumps so true it's like that is your body giving you guidance as a channel from the energy of your higher self so first and foremost the biggest thing that everybody can do right now is have tools and practices that connect you or or help you to hear understand and translate the voice of your intuition and the guidance so how do we do that I mean I think prayer meditation getting into this getting into the frequency of Nature and just sitting there in silence and being once you're observed by Nature you can you become a Clear Channel to source so your intuition becomes very loud in that silence and frequency of of the Perfection of nature nature meditation constantly I call it mental hygiene um which you know Marian Williamson speaks so beautifully about in the film you know we shower it's totally societally normal to shower our physical bodies off every day um it should be just as if not more important to shower our minds and the gunk and the residue and all the buildup we get from the stress of the day and the information we're taking on we need mental hydrant we need to to cleanse and release all of that you know buildup and and energetic plaque of our thoughts and all the stuff that we that just kind of clutters our mind every day in meditation I you know I love Transcendental Meditation because you use 20 minutes in the morning to set the tone and create the space so that you can deal with the day and then 20 minutes in the afternoon slash evening to let go and shower off all the gunk that you've accumulated in the day so so I just think you know those pract journaling in the morning gratitude gratitude is a frequency that um again just changes the flow and vitality like the the language of the universe is like love and that the language of nature is like gratitude and awe nature is just in awe of itself all the time it's an awe and just so grateful for its source for providing everything it needs to regenerate and and survive and and be and Thrive and just be beautiful so if we can tap into that frequency of awe and gratitude you know Journal meditate mental hygiene and then be in nature to tap into that higher um guidance that inner guidance from our source and our higher self I think that's what we need to uh be able to navigate the Rapids of the current times I remember that from watching heel the intuition part actually came in super strong and that's been something that I've observed not only in myself within my CL but also within my closer Circle those who are giving themselves time to be still to meditate to actually listen and I mean with with our senses multi- uh you know dimensional sensors more so than just the five or six if you include thought they are the ones that are able to find answers much faster so I love this conversation about intuition it's as if it's a a superpower innately given to us that many have forgotten or suppressed what would happen if we would activate the true part of the intelligence of that within ourselves and isn't it amazing that we all have the capacity to do so without paying a scent for it meditation is free hiking is free journaling is free and so on and so forth I love it Kelly okay sister I've got one last question for you straight off the cuff are you ready yep let's go so here's the question I want you to now man imagine um Kelly nunz you're on this world stage the entire world every sentient being alive has gathered they're watching they're listening and they're tuning in to your message when you're ready take a breath take as long as you need and do share Kelly what is your message to the world right now this is good so my message to the world would be we live in a world of infinite possibility we all have unique incredible purpose for being here at this time in history we have unique superpowers and gifts to express we have unique and perfect Beauty in whatever form that we have shown up here in this lifetime at this time and so much more is possible than we've been led to believe once we tap into the intelligence the Beauty and the love that nature shows us and once we can connect to Source like we have access to infinite possibility like whatever you dream know that that dream is in you and in your Consciousness because in some possibility it is it's already happened so not only you were given that dream because you've were also given everything you need to see that dream realize then go beyond that stretch your mind beyond that go okay that's my dream in this current Consciousness go beyond what's even bigger than that dream like stretch possibility because so much more is possible than we can imagine and you know life is good and like you said in closing life is for us never against us things are not happening to us they're happening for us so let's go sorry yes yes you can yes you can oh brilliant brilliant

much  <br>00:02:06.640 for coming on the show I wanted to do  <br>00:02:08.360 this interview for ages so I really  <br>00:02:09.919 appreciate your time today delighted to  <br>00:02:11.560 be here ready to go I've got to know you  <br>00:02:14.000 over the course of the last few months  <br>00:02:15.879 and been fascinated by your story what  <br>00:02:18.920 you do as a businessman how you live  <br>00:02:20.920 your life and the philosophies that you  <br>00:02:23.440 follow and for me trying to partner up  <br>00:02:27.879 some of the ways that you do business  <br>00:02:29.959 along with how you think okay and how  <br>00:02:31.680 you operate as a human being is  <br>00:02:33.040 something that I've really wanted to try  <br>00:02:34.319 and get to the bottom of and learn about  <br>00:02:36.480 for my own benefit but also with  <br>00:02:38.560 everybody that consumes this content and  <br>00:02:40.239 this podcast I want really people to  <br>00:02:41.840 take some real valuable lessons for this  <br>00:02:43.519 today so first of all let's just start  <br>00:02:46.080 off with a bit of a background on on  <br>00:02:47.519 your business okay and your business  <br>00:02:49.599 career so we can give people some  <br>00:02:50.879 context and then we're going to dive  <br>00:02:52.000 into a few other areas and then  <br>00:02:53.280 hopefully we'll just patch it all up  <br>00:02:54.680 together and people will see why you are  <br>00:02:57.040 who you are and why you do what you do  <br>00:02:59.360 okay well I started I studied uh primary  <br>00:03:02.640 Business Degree with French business  <br>00:03:04.440 process or engineering so I was always  <br>00:03:05.959 kind of process-led but not technology  <br>00:03:08.400 was all strategy uh you couldn't do that  <br>00:03:11.440 uh without embracing technology and very  <br>00:03:14.400 very early on like 1995 96 I got  <br>00:03:17.560 introduced to the internet and I was  <br>00:03:19.560 actually working in IBM at the time in  <br>00:03:21.120 Dublin and I was basically still a  <br>00:03:23.400 student and I remember just thinking wow  <br>00:03:25.120 this is this has got reached this has  <br>00:03:27.159 got benefit so I kind of decided to take  <br>00:03:30.040 my career on on on that as a medium and  <br>00:03:32.840 so I started by understanding the  <br>00:03:35.159 mathematics behind building networks  <br>00:03:36.879 tcpip and so on which my brain really  <br>00:03:39.239 only started working in college so then  <br>00:03:41.080 things made sense to me in terms of how  <br>00:03:42.519 you map things out and uh then I started  <br>00:03:45.159 lecturing on that started talking about  <br>00:03:46.560 it and teaching people and bringing  <br>00:03:48.159 people along and started getting  <br>00:03:50.400 insights into how people receive  <br>00:03:52.720 information because you know you're  <br>00:03:54.239 there lecturing on these pretty tough  <br>00:03:56.319 topics but you're saying the same thing  <br>00:03:58.599 week after week uh but you see them  <br>00:04:00.640 taking it in for the first time or not  <br>00:04:02.239 taking it in and it it teaches you a lot  <br>00:04:04.480 about how people absorb information how  <br>00:04:07.200 they bounces off them sometimes and  <br>00:04:08.720 things like that because to you it's  <br>00:04:10.480 autopilot so you can focus on them  <br>00:04:12.640 rather than what's coming out of your  <br>00:04:14.239 mouth you know it inside out and uh so  <br>00:04:16.160 that was really interesting and that  <br>00:04:17.720 kind of led me to to a lot of  <br>00:04:19.639 realizations  <br>00:04:21.040 about tech and people because you got  <br>00:04:23.759 people who they wanted to look good in  <br>00:04:25.360 their jobs they were good at marketing  <br>00:04:26.960 or something else and then suddenly  <br>00:04:28.400 there's this internet thing that they  <br>00:04:29.720 they have to understand I wasn't a  <br>00:04:32.199 techie I couldn't go deep on this stuff  <br>00:04:34.000 I I but I started working with people  <br>00:04:35.960 who could and I kind of made a career  <br>00:04:37.960 for myself out of being in that bridge  <br>00:04:40.160 between the human problem and and  <br>00:04:43.360 technology so then I got into uh  <br>00:04:46.880 internet development companies from  <br>00:04:48.520 there and then in 2002 I started my  <br>00:04:51.360 first startup I actually moved home to  <br>00:04:53.440 my parents uh house went up to the attic  <br>00:04:56.360 rolled out a carpet and made a deal with  <br>00:04:58.120 them and said look I I'm using my  <br>00:04:59.680 apartment savings to pay for other staff  <br>00:05:02.080 but um if I can work here I'll just make  <br>00:05:05.039 sure there's always good wine in the  <br>00:05:06.160 fridge and we shook hands on that and  <br>00:05:07.680 that was it I started there then I moved  <br>00:05:10.360 to my first office because I could I  <br>00:05:12.880 could pay a monthly rent first so I  <br>00:05:14.479 didn't have to commit to a long-term  <br>00:05:15.919 lease and that was above a shop and that  <br>00:05:18.160 was disastrous because the boardroom we  <br>00:05:20.880 had I I had bought a a table in a  <br>00:05:24.080 liquidation sale from an old friend of  <br>00:05:25.800 mine which was huge and in our front  <br>00:05:29.120 room which was a converted bedroom or  <br>00:05:30.800 boardroom as we call it if there's more  <br>00:05:32.639 than five people in the room the floor  <br>00:05:34.199 started to give so if a client arrived  <br>00:05:36.520 with more than two people with I might  <br>00:05:37.919 have to say to one of my staff go out  <br>00:05:39.400 the back door I'll tell them you're sick  <br>00:05:40.680 because we couldn't admit that the floor  <br>00:05:41.919 was caving in and we only had one you  <br>00:05:44.960 there was about a 12we lead time for an  <br>00:05:46.880 internet cable for ISDN it's 128  <br>00:05:50.039 kilobyte so we had one phone cable there  <br>00:05:52.800 was six staff one phone cable and uh the  <br>00:05:55.560 debate every day was who's got the  <br>00:05:57.039 internet so we were a web agency  <br>00:05:59.080 pitching for these these large  <br>00:06:00.800 contracts and uh we'd have debates every  <br>00:06:03.080 day why do you need the internet today  <br>00:06:04.479 and you like why you get this proposal  <br>00:06:06.160 at your client why do you need it and  <br>00:06:07.840 the tech you like if I don't start  <br>00:06:08.960 uploading the website today it won't be  <br>00:06:10.880 there by 8:00 in the morning okay you  <br>00:06:13.319 win so that was a Continuum that was my  <br>00:06:15.880 first startup and uh I'd call it  <br>00:06:18.199 Continuum because I wanted an ongoing  <br>00:06:20.080 relationship with with uh customers it  <br>00:06:22.919 started as being Continuum Technologies  <br>00:06:24.520 but the Technologies word aged really  <br>00:06:26.960 really quickly so I very quickly pivoted  <br>00:06:29.240 to kind of make it about people and uh  <br>00:06:31.599 we did very well we grew up and then and  <br>00:06:33.639 then in 2015 I overleveraged myself and  <br>00:06:36.560 then broke that out into a group so we  <br>00:06:38.680 had uh a lot more opportunities for  <br>00:06:41.080 growth there because people were coming  <br>00:06:42.800 to agencies saying I need a thing built  <br>00:06:44.720 I've got this budget this time scale and  <br>00:06:46.720 it has to do the following and I really  <br>00:06:48.960 want to get ahead of that say well how  <br>00:06:51.360 did you make all those decisions how do  <br>00:06:52.599 you know they're the right decisions and  <br>00:06:54.199 they typically didn't have answers so  <br>00:06:56.360 then we went towards what was called  <br>00:06:58.000 digital transformation which was getting  <br>00:06:59.759 ahead of that and you'd go in and write  <br>00:07:02.000 the road map with them and keep more  <br>00:07:04.039 importantly get the benefit of the doubt  <br>00:07:05.639 from them that you know let's talk about  <br>00:07:08.240 the proposal before you decide selling  <br>00:07:10.479 this to North America is the plan you  <br>00:07:13.120 challenge that idea but what it also  <br>00:07:15.680 meant then is that suddenly you were  <br>00:07:17.039 influential on how they went to B  <br>00:07:19.280 business and then suddenly you were  <br>00:07:20.319 winning business by default so we could  <br>00:07:22.199 start much earlier than a lot of our  <br>00:07:23.680 competition and then we could end much  <br>00:07:25.680 further because then we went into cyber  <br>00:07:28.120 security we went into hosting we went  <br>00:07:29.840 into  <br>00:07:30.720 24/7 uh support so you couldn't have  <br>00:07:34.199 full-time Engineers all the time but we  <br>00:07:35.879 had Partnerships with places that had  <br>00:07:38.160 24-hour Network operating centers and  <br>00:07:40.120 you just hand them a run book after 5:30  <br>00:07:42.720 at night so you were able to then  <br>00:07:45.520 support your clients 247 for a lot  <br>00:07:47.319 cheaper than a lot of your competition  <br>00:07:49.319 and there was still an escalation  <br>00:07:50.919 process um but when we started I mean I  <br>00:07:53.639 had a one-page website that was an extr  <br>00:07:56.840 net it said please enter your your  <br>00:07:58.400 username and password to log in cuz it  <br>00:08:01.199 was completely bootstrapped right and no  <br>00:08:03.440 matter what you put in there it just  <br>00:08:04.680 came back with oh I'm sorry your  <br>00:08:06.120 username is incorrect please contact  <br>00:08:07.879 sales at this number for extra support  <br>00:08:10.319 which rang my mobile directly and I  <br>00:08:12.680 remember when I won my first big  <br>00:08:14.039 contract uh it was actually Nissan and  <br>00:08:16.720 uh I remember the guys asked me do we  <br>00:08:18.120 get access to your Swanky externet now I  <br>00:08:20.280 said no no no you get me fulltime you  <br>00:08:21.960 get all of our service so it you know it  <br>00:08:24.680 was it was a bit of a bit of that it was  <br>00:08:26.800 very very critical path um very much  <br>00:08:29.039 about um being very deliberate there's a  <br>00:08:31.520 word I overuse which is the word  <br>00:08:32.958 deliberate but it was it was about being  <br>00:08:34.719 very very specific and very deliberate  <br>00:08:36.360 both in terms of what you were doing  <br>00:08:38.360 more importantly what you weren't doing  <br>00:08:40.440 and uh you know the people that you went  <br>00:08:42.479 along with you know it's a it's a space  <br>00:08:44.720 where you have to admit very quickly I  <br>00:08:46.519 just don't understand that or I I know  <br>00:08:48.680 what to get out of that person or that  <br>00:08:50.320 Tech or that skill and and how to pull  <br>00:08:52.600 it together and as that evolved into a  <br>00:08:54.399 group and we started getting much bigger  <br>00:08:55.880 clients and much longer contracts and a  <br>00:08:57.920 lot more dependencies  <br>00:08:59.880 you know I remember being challenged One  <br>00:09:01.320 Day by a very large International firm  <br>00:09:03.000 the head of marketing and she said  <br>00:09:04.360 you're the guy I never meet again once I  <br>00:09:06.720 sign this contract and I said I'm the  <br>00:09:09.480 guy that's responsible to make sure you  <br>00:09:11.320 have the right people in front of you at  <br>00:09:12.560 the right time and if that doesn't  <br>00:09:14.360 happen then I'm the guy you call and she  <br>00:09:16.440 said fair enough and she signed a  <br>00:09:17.480 multiion contract on that and and that  <br>00:09:20.040 was kind of that was the approach um but  <br>00:09:22.480 it was you know hard yards I went  <br>00:09:24.600 through two recessions a pandemic uh and  <br>00:09:28.680 I built up into a group I sold U most  <br>00:09:31.680 Parts anything that had staff um I sold  <br>00:09:35.079 I was taking a break I had lost  <br>00:09:36.440 unfortunately one or two members of my  <br>00:09:37.680 family and just decided to take a break  <br>00:09:39.560 so sold all of that and kept the  <br>00:09:41.560 investment stuff which brings us up to  <br>00:09:45.200 2018 uh where I live now is continuous  <br>00:09:47.760 Ventures uh and how I'd started that was  <br>00:09:51.800 as a give back as a CS so we did lots of  <br>00:09:54.240 Charity websites and projects and I went  <br>00:09:56.160 to Africa for years I went to Chernobyl  <br>00:09:57.920 I went to all these places because I had  <br>00:09:59.839 that freedom you know the tech was going  <br>00:10:01.519 well the business was going well I was  <br>00:10:03.000 free and single I was just enjoying  <br>00:10:05.240 other things in life I played music I  <br>00:10:07.040 wrote all these things uh and it was  <br>00:10:09.440 nice it was very very fulfilling uh as  <br>00:10:11.760 part of that and you know to be honest  <br>00:10:13.839 I'd become a bit complacent about  <br>00:10:15.120 business it kind of ran itself and I was  <br>00:10:16.839 like okay well I can now do this in my  <br>00:10:18.959 sleep and now just es and flows with  <br>00:10:21.240 society and values and markets and so on  <br>00:10:24.240 so it's doing other things but one thing  <br>00:10:25.920 that I really got struck by was the  <br>00:10:28.320 amount of mistakes that's startups we're  <br>00:10:30.279 making and uh as our give back instead  <br>00:10:33.600 of doing all the charity stuff which is  <br>00:10:35.079 extremely important but I found that the  <br>00:10:37.519 ask never changed it was just we need  <br>00:10:39.320 more of the same we need more of the  <br>00:10:40.560 same More Money More investment we'd  <br>00:10:42.320 build websites extr Nets things like  <br>00:10:44.959 that for them just as a as a giveaway  <br>00:10:46.639 just best of luck with that and and you  <br>00:10:48.639 know it was very important work  <br>00:10:51.480 extremely important but it was a lot of  <br>00:10:53.079 the same and the biggest lesson it  <br>00:10:55.760 taught me was about you know I mean you  <br>00:10:58.360 focus on the power content for for your  <br>00:11:00.880 for your living for what we're doing  <br>00:11:02.320 right here but in agency world you kind  <br>00:11:04.839 of it's about the impact of the message  <br>00:11:06.639 for the customer or the customer's  <br>00:11:08.200 customer and so on but I remember we  <br>00:11:09.800 were doing a website for a kids  <br>00:11:11.240 orphanage and a a Content update update  <br>00:11:14.560 came up to the design team and they just  <br>00:11:17.200 said uh can you remove the pictures of  <br>00:11:18.959 those three girls because they've all  <br>00:11:20.120 passed away and they were all like 10 12  <br>00:11:22.079 years of age and the impact in the  <br>00:11:24.480 office I can still get the Goosebumps  <br>00:11:26.240 now it hit the place like a tsunami it  <br>00:11:28.639 was just this  <br>00:11:30.440 Frozen vacuum of feeling that they the  <br>00:11:34.079 impact of that for designers and  <br>00:11:35.880 developers there was tears there was  <br>00:11:37.279 everything and you get that a lot with  <br>00:11:40.000 you know charity projects some of your  <br>00:11:41.959 most calm and quiet staff could be ones  <br>00:11:45.279 that feel the most passionate about a  <br>00:11:47.720 particular cause or particular um you  <br>00:11:50.120 know charity or or proposal um but I  <br>00:11:53.839 just remember the uniformity of of of  <br>00:11:56.200 everyone's feelings and that I was just  <br>00:11:57.519 sudden like oh God this is this is  <br>00:11:58.959 really real it's not just web stuff so I  <br>00:12:02.240 decided after that it was one of those  <br>00:12:04.320 kind of moments I just thought I need  <br>00:12:06.440 this needs to be about real people how  <br>00:12:08.040 we help Society sh about real real  <br>00:12:10.279 people so what it did was every second  <br>00:12:12.600 Thursday because we built out a group  <br>00:12:14.120 with a lot of senior people um every  <br>00:12:16.639 second Thursday I would advise for free  <br>00:12:19.079 with startups and just put it out there  <br>00:12:21.160 you i' kind of grown up in business in  <br>00:12:22.760 Dublin was well known in business terms  <br>00:12:25.199 particularly in Internet terms in Dublin  <br>00:12:27.360 and so just put Linked In and things  <br>00:12:29.920 like that you know with a little bit of  <br>00:12:31.800 pre-qualification we'll look at some of  <br>00:12:33.519 these things and then again because I  <br>00:12:35.959 wouldn't understand it fully I'd pull in  <br>00:12:37.800 you know CTO or design or development or  <br>00:12:40.920 strategy and then this kind of formula  <br>00:12:43.399 was born  <br>00:12:45.000 where I could make these very senior  <br>00:12:47.240 people that were sunken cost to us I  <br>00:12:49.480 could make them available to these  <br>00:12:50.760 startups just to help them avoid the  <br>00:12:52.519 mistakes that I made you know they say  <br>00:12:54.440 an expert is somebody who's made every  <br>00:12:56.000 mistake in a focused area uh I was  <br>00:12:58.880 definitely an expert for making all  <br>00:13:01.000 those mistakes and it was great  <br>00:13:02.680 satisfaction in just helping them  <br>00:13:04.639 reverse out of situations that they'  <br>00:13:06.639 caught up you know every every company  <br>00:13:08.639 has challenges that to them is  <br>00:13:11.000 completely new but you start seeing it  <br>00:13:12.519 on a routine basis you're like oh i'  <br>00:13:14.399 just I'd caution you there or let's just  <br>00:13:16.920 have another look at that and you try  <br>00:13:18.279 and draw it out of them rather than tell  <br>00:13:19.959 them you know um the language you use is  <br>00:13:22.720 very important but I was used to dealing  <br>00:13:24.160 with super bright people far brighter  <br>00:13:26.079 than me I like being the dumbest guy in  <br>00:13:27.839 every room particularly the team I've  <br>00:13:29.440 recently uh built and uh so the language  <br>00:13:33.120 you use is kind of supportive but coxing  <br>00:13:35.079 you know you firm on topics not on  <br>00:13:36.720 people and things like that and uh and  <br>00:13:39.519 then you know when when you needed to be  <br>00:13:40.959 a bit stronger with them you could be  <br>00:13:42.480 and then that led to being chairman of  <br>00:13:44.240 one or two things and I personally  <br>00:13:45.639 invested in a few of these startups but  <br>00:13:48.519 the energy that came from these as I saw  <br>00:13:51.519 them kids I mean they weren't but they  <br>00:13:53.720 were kids and and uh excited  <br>00:13:57.079 entrepreneurs and first timers and and  <br>00:13:59.120 midtimes and all this kind of stuff it  <br>00:14:01.680 just reinvigorated me towards the  <br>00:14:03.519 strategy of business and the ABS and  <br>00:14:05.120 flows and you know my kind of best  <br>00:14:08.040 definition of an entrepreneur is is is  <br>00:14:10.199 somebody who creates unlimited results  <br>00:14:13.199 out of often limited to no means by use  <br>00:14:16.199 of their their focus their ability to  <br>00:14:18.399 harness Talent harness people and  <br>00:14:19.920 resources and opportunities around them  <br>00:14:21.639 to to see their purpose through and you  <br>00:14:24.519 just trying to put that into these guys  <br>00:14:26.399 or you know or Draw it out of them some  <br>00:14:27.959 of them are amazing but they can't talk  <br>00:14:30.560 to somebody they can they can explain  <br>00:14:32.680 the best mathematics in the world but  <br>00:14:34.320 you put them in a room with a pretty  <br>00:14:35.920 girl and they go red and stare at the  <br>00:14:38.040 floor you know everyone needed strength  <br>00:14:40.360 at different times but certainly the  <br>00:14:43.199 model for continuous Ventures was born  <br>00:14:45.240 out of that fact that apart from the  <br>00:14:47.040 advisory and the investment making very  <br>00:14:50.199 Senior People available to these  <br>00:14:51.680 startups so they're not burning their  <br>00:14:53.199 own cash all the time you see these  <br>00:14:54.720 startups they raise a million or two and  <br>00:14:57.360 then before you know they've hired  <br>00:14:58.440 people they don't how to use properly  <br>00:15:00.040 they're underutilized even from a time  <br>00:15:01.839 and cost point of view and they're  <br>00:15:03.600 burning cash and suddenly the pressure's  <br>00:15:05.279 on and they probably got a a bear of an  <br>00:15:07.600 investor sitting at the boardroom table  <br>00:15:09.199 tapping the  <br>00:15:10.519 table so we could just absorb that into  <br>00:15:13.000 our model and and then kind of  <br>00:15:14.680 facilitate the conduit for startups and  <br>00:15:17.199 that's what I do know  <br>00:15:19.959 wow let's talk about digital  <br>00:15:22.000 transformation because I think it's a  <br>00:15:24.399 term that's that's widely used that most  <br>00:15:27.480 people don't really understand so can  <br>00:15:29.120 you explain to me what it is and give me  <br>00:15:30.920 an  <br>00:15:31.600 example yes uh one of the things about  <br>00:15:34.000 digital transformation is defining what  <br>00:15:35.720 it isn't uh every company will say we  <br>00:15:38.199 want to be you know we want to do a  <br>00:15:40.360 digital transformation program and we're  <br>00:15:42.160 going to be the best in our field or  <br>00:15:43.519 we're going to be you know leading the  <br>00:15:45.480 market and so  <br>00:15:46.639 on companies want digital transformation  <br>00:15:49.199 until you try and change something and  <br>00:15:50.759 then they realize they just want digital  <br>00:15:52.360 efficiency they want it faster a little  <br>00:15:54.560 bit more accurate or better or shinier  <br>00:15:57.519 but when you say okay we're going to  <br>00:15:59.480 totally recalibrate how you do your  <br>00:16:01.079 business how you talk to your customer  <br>00:16:02.480 where you where your customer is or what  <br>00:16:03.920 channels you go to market or a big one  <br>00:16:06.959 is what do you do with your data do you  <br>00:16:09.360 you gather loads of data have you any  <br>00:16:11.079 insight on what that data  <br>00:16:12.959 is and then you try and you you try and  <br>00:16:15.560 recalibrate you try and change it find  <br>00:16:17.440 new rootes to Market an example I gave  <br>00:16:19.560 was you get the airline business they  <br>00:16:21.680 know you're flying from from Dublin to  <br>00:16:23.720 Dubai and you're flying you know at on  <br>00:16:26.240 this date you've booked it in a certain  <br>00:16:27.959 language you're your you know business  <br>00:16:30.319 or first or economy class you know what  <br>00:16:33.160 airport you're going to how long you're  <br>00:16:34.680 staying all of that  <br>00:16:36.199 data and the airline business started  <br>00:16:38.399 kind of transforming that to say okay  <br>00:16:40.120 well then we can start making  <br>00:16:41.319 assumptions and now it's done with more  <br>00:16:42.880 AI but it was more kind of digital  <br>00:16:45.319 suppositions before to say okay well  <br>00:16:47.800 you're traveling with two kids so you  <br>00:16:49.639 possibly need a car and you possibly  <br>00:16:51.440 need to return it on this day so here's  <br>00:16:52.920 a guest average of a three star level  <br>00:16:55.720 car at this price or three star level  <br>00:16:58.639 hot hotel or five star level Hotel  <br>00:17:00.680 depending on your profile and you know I  <br>00:17:03.920 I remember working on that a long long  <br>00:17:05.559 time ago for Rhino [hotels.com](http://hotels.com/) for  <br>00:17:07.799 example and they they in the first year  <br>00:17:10.000 they increased the revenue by 11% just  <br>00:17:12.079 by changing that one thing and that's a  <br>00:17:14.799 you know it's using your data to reach  <br>00:17:17.199 your customer in a in a deeper way not  <br>00:17:19.280 in a new way because you've already sold  <br>00:17:21.000 to them but now you're saying let's  <br>00:17:22.119 let's solve those problems for you as  <br>00:17:23.520 well and in this in the spirit of  <br>00:17:26.000 critical thinking and deliberate  <br>00:17:27.679 thinking it's it's how do you nail the  <br>00:17:30.679 job to be done you know and old elector  <br>00:17:32.760 mind you say that how do you nail the  <br>00:17:34.160 job to be done getting that one thing  <br>00:17:37.039 right that is a pain for a customer and  <br>00:17:39.679 you solve it and it's that thing of you  <br>00:17:41.600 don't buy a drill because you need a  <br>00:17:42.799 drill you buy a drill because you need a  <br>00:17:44.160 hole so so can can I maybe take an  <br>00:17:47.360 example within my business about how  <br>00:17:49.840 that would apply then so so one of my  <br>00:17:51.760 businesses is an insurance brokerage  <br>00:17:54.039 that insurance brokerage predominantly  <br>00:17:55.799 sells medical insurance okay now our  <br>00:17:58.559 client have other insurance needs but we  <br>00:18:01.039 predominantly focus on medical insurance  <br>00:18:03.799 but the buyer or the decision maker  <br>00:18:07.400 would be the HR Director followed by the  <br>00:18:11.080 CFO who would sign it off so HR Director  <br>00:18:13.080 does the leg work CFO signs it off make  <br>00:18:14.960 sure they've got the budget to do  <br>00:18:16.559 it we have a requirement to potentially  <br>00:18:19.919 Sell gratuiti Solutions to companies  <br>00:18:22.320 here the same decision maker is involved  <br>00:18:25.159 on a B2B basis really because the HR  <br>00:18:27.240 Director and the CFO are the ones that  <br>00:18:28.520 were the decisions about that kind of  <br>00:18:30.120 stuff so am why on the clock now am I am  <br>00:18:32.280 I  <br>00:18:34.360 good I just because I want I want to  <br>00:18:36.400 give everyone context if we could we we  <br>00:18:38.200 we could do it there because I think  <br>00:18:39.200 that was a b Toc model and and and  <br>00:18:41.440 because digital transformation I think  <br>00:18:42.799 would apply to B2B of course as well  <br>00:18:44.440 yeah yeah it's where most of the most of  <br>00:18:46.120 the work is so the work that you'd be  <br>00:18:47.960 doing is you potentially would be  <br>00:18:49.679 looking at that saying right you're  <br>00:18:50.720 sending to this type of customer this  <br>00:18:53.039 type of product or service what other  <br>00:18:54.880 the problems do they have and how can I  <br>00:18:57.600 solve other problems that they've got  <br>00:18:59.679 because they've already made a  <br>00:19:00.640 commitment to be a customer anyway and  <br>00:19:02.679 how can I do that in a more digitally  <br>00:19:05.039 effective process yeah in fact the the  <br>00:19:08.200 example you give is is a very  <br>00:19:09.919 interesting and easier one to solve  <br>00:19:12.080 although it's it's big pieces of work  <br>00:19:14.440 and the first thing you do is you know  <br>00:19:15.880 you say for example a HR Director um  <br>00:19:18.600 would be would be involved in in signing  <br>00:19:20.480 off on that for a company so  <br>00:19:22.760 particularly in Dubai you've got a legal  <br>00:19:24.200 requirement to provide certain levels of  <br>00:19:25.640 health insurance and so on and then  <br>00:19:26.919 depending on the profile of the staff  <br>00:19:28.400 you might at various  <br>00:19:30.000 levels so you got that but then you look  <br>00:19:32.960 at the problems that the HR Director or  <br>00:19:36.679 chief people officer has so actually up  <br>00:19:39.080 until recently and a client to  <br>00:19:40.280 continuous is a company called covis and  <br>00:19:42.480 they're like the Harvard Business review  <br>00:19:43.960 of strategy for chief people officers  <br>00:19:46.280 right so when the you know the chief  <br>00:19:48.320 people officer of Pepsi gets asked  <br>00:19:50.120 what's our working from home policy post  <br>00:19:52.080 pandemic they turn to academics to say  <br>00:19:55.120 well you know firstly prove it secondly  <br>00:19:57.720 give me a template for in that out  <br>00:19:59.320 across my staff across the world so if  <br>00:20:01.840 you look at that person's um profile and  <br>00:20:05.039 problem it's typically a mid toate uh  <br>00:20:08.039 director female and in in that role but  <br>00:20:12.280 then if you think of let's say her  <br>00:20:15.280 her uh customers and her customers are  <br>00:20:18.039 the staff so then you take anything that  <br>00:20:20.559 you're signing and passing through like  <br>00:20:22.240 Insurance whether it's medical insurance  <br>00:20:24.559 whether it's car insurance pet insurance  <br>00:20:26.159 doesn't matter that's solving a problem  <br>00:20:28.080 for her C customer who is the the staff  <br>00:20:30.240 member so then you follow the data down  <br>00:20:32.840 to them and you say okay well I've also  <br>00:20:34.559 noticed that you have a husband and  <br>00:20:36.440 husband is a separate policy someplace  <br>00:20:38.120 else okay so let's let's get efficient  <br>00:20:40.360 here about cross- selling and we'll  <br>00:20:41.919 offer a family discount that's the easy  <br>00:20:44.039 stuff okay but then you start saying  <br>00:20:46.159 okay how are we going to separate  <br>00:20:47.280 ourselves apart and this is really where  <br>00:20:48.840 digital transformation kicks in because  <br>00:20:50.440 you then say right we know from the  <br>00:20:53.480 profile of the staff that that person  <br>00:20:55.840 maybe the CFO of the same company is a  <br>00:20:58.280 50 year old man and you know he's always  <br>00:21:01.720 asking about Family Insurance  <br>00:21:03.240 particularly maybe insurance for his  <br>00:21:05.120 father or something and then you go down  <br>00:21:07.000 that rabbit hole and you say okay his  <br>00:21:09.240 father is Alzheimer's he's no power of  <br>00:21:11.600 attorney with his father's data you  <br>00:21:13.720 think of where that medical data sits  <br>00:21:15.559 does it sit in a hospital does it sit in  <br>00:21:17.400 his in his pocket has a bunch of  <br>00:21:18.960 doctor's notes and can you digitize that  <br>00:21:21.799 and if you can digitize that then you  <br>00:21:24.159 can you're your that person can be  <br>00:21:26.240 authorized to maybe make decisions for  <br>00:21:28.640 father about his medication renewing his  <br>00:21:30.880 prescriptions anything like that so  <br>00:21:32.600 you're solving very very personal  <br>00:21:34.720 problems for people you're doing it in a  <br>00:21:36.799 very data efficient way and you're  <br>00:21:39.480 you're kind of going down the rabbit  <br>00:21:40.880 hole of of every individual need and  <br>00:21:43.600 that's how you kind of get you know  <br>00:21:45.320 loyalty and stickiness with these  <br>00:21:46.799 Platforms in a world of a million apps  <br>00:21:49.200 right it's the ones that you know really  <br>00:21:51.919 channel the life blood of people's  <br>00:21:53.880 problems is where you'll find the money  <br>00:21:55.919 and they will say if you if you solve  <br>00:21:57.320 one problem a person has on a recurring  <br>00:21:59.400 basis you'll make a couple of million  <br>00:22:00.720 dollars in in in those apps but it's  <br>00:22:03.200 just in those processes the ability to  <br>00:22:05.799 breathe life into following the data and  <br>00:22:09.440 solving those problems for everybody so  <br>00:22:11.919 then you say okay we sell  <br>00:22:14.159 insurance but you can self tailor that  <br>00:22:16.960 insurance the company is paying for your  <br>00:22:18.559 insurance but we're going to give you  <br>00:22:20.000 through our platform or through app the  <br>00:22:21.880 ability to really self- tailor that so  <br>00:22:24.360 you've got you've got a a a blanket  <br>00:22:26.440 coverage or you can maybe upself for  <br>00:22:28.720 blank coverage and here's multiple  <br>00:22:31.000 scenarios everyone typically has a  <br>00:22:32.919 mother or father or somebody that might  <br>00:22:35.400 be unwell or somebody that's just been  <br>00:22:36.960 born or you just never know but you can  <br>00:22:39.679 you can suppose those scenarios and then  <br>00:22:42.320 you can provide processes and data for  <br>00:22:44.640 that and then once you do that you can  <br>00:22:47.240 go further down the rabbit hole and say  <br>00:22:49.200 okay this person is a diabetic okay we  <br>00:22:51.320 should set up relationships with  <br>00:22:52.600 diabetic firms to get bulk purchasing of  <br>00:22:55.919 this and make it available through the  <br>00:22:57.200 app as well so now suddenly were a super  <br>00:22:59.159 app because we're we're ordering we're  <br>00:23:01.400 now a logistics company right we're  <br>00:23:03.480 ordering um you know insulin or we're  <br>00:23:06.360 ordering headache tablets or blood  <br>00:23:08.039 pressure tablets or whatever and then  <br>00:23:10.360 you know you kind of go down that route  <br>00:23:12.559 I looked at a project before where we  <br>00:23:14.279 wanted  <br>00:23:15.200 to revolutionize the concept of a first  <br>00:23:18.120 aid kit we wanted to make a first aid  <br>00:23:19.840 kit or the concept of a first aid kit a  <br>00:23:22.200 smart device in a home so you think of  <br>00:23:24.520 the tech involved in in um opening your  <br>00:23:26.799 phone uh with your face or recording  <br>00:23:29.559 your voice or whatever if you had a sick  <br>00:23:31.480 parent the machine could bleep for the  <br>00:23:33.679 parent to come along it could dispense a  <br>00:23:35.880 tablet record that person taking the  <br>00:23:38.440 tablet talk them through the process  <br>00:23:40.400 reorder if necessary because it's a  <br>00:23:42.200 secure device with with digital  <br>00:23:44.159 encryption and then you as a son could  <br>00:23:46.799 be sent a little video oh yeah Dad took  <br>00:23:48.440 his medicine soor great solved so that's  <br>00:23:51.720 kind of how you you you lean into a  <br>00:23:53.559 process like insurance which in in  <br>00:23:55.799 Insurance worlds can just be erased to  <br>00:23:57.159 the bottom it can be price price price  <br>00:23:58.600 and and what's available for what  <br>00:24:00.640 different profile of insurance level you  <br>00:24:02.360 have but there's so much more to it if  <br>00:24:04.559 you make it about the human then you  <br>00:24:06.919 wrap the process around the human then  <br>00:24:08.559 you've got a bigger Market got it okay  <br>00:24:12.960 so the way that you describe everything  <br>00:24:15.520 clearly very intelligent around that but  <br>00:24:18.480 and and as you as you explain your  <br>00:24:19.720 journey apart from being at the  <br>00:24:20.880 beginning where up in the attic there  <br>00:24:22.440 and not really having much money behind  <br>00:24:24.000 you and boardroom tables that are a  <br>00:24:25.480 little bit too heavy and so on  <br>00:24:28.760 talk to me about because we always talk  <br>00:24:30.159 about the winds don't we we hear a lot  <br>00:24:31.919 about how someone turned this into this  <br>00:24:33.559 into this and it was yes B an IPO and Y  <br>00:24:35.799 didly everyone got very rich but you  <br>00:24:38.360 also spoke about how when when you when  <br>00:24:40.640 you look at people that have said  <br>00:24:41.720 setting up companies the ones that have  <br>00:24:43.200 failed before okay if you've made the  <br>00:24:45.720 mistakes then you'll you you they've  <br>00:24:47.240 probably been costly in the early stages  <br>00:24:49.039 and so you've learned some really  <br>00:24:50.039 valuable lessons yes tell me about a  <br>00:24:52.440 business that you got involved with that  <br>00:24:55.360 you look back now and you're like I wish  <br>00:24:58.000 I never did that but I got some valuable  <br>00:25:00.039 lessons from it um yes uh I remember  <br>00:25:03.440 being on on uh the chairman on a minor  <br>00:25:07.159 shareholder in a in a project with Nile  <br>00:25:10.000 Horn you know from One Direction okay  <br>00:25:12.399 and uh it was in Nile Emoji so it was he  <br>00:25:15.799 consulted with our designers to create  <br>00:25:17.480 different emojis of his face all  <br>00:25:20.120 selected by him and signed off by him  <br>00:25:22.480 and then when he released his album uh  <br>00:25:25.559 it was I think it his first solo album  <br>00:25:27.240 maybe his second solo album  <br>00:25:29.120 um we released this at the same time  <br>00:25:30.919 with his Blessing like he was part he  <br>00:25:32.360 was a director in the firm and and a  <br>00:25:33.919 shareholder and we released it and it  <br>00:25:36.679 was a lot of work and it was a lot of  <br>00:25:38.480 advertising also amazing to see the  <br>00:25:41.360 power of celebrity endorsement because  <br>00:25:43.360 as soon as it went out on his Instagram  <br>00:25:45.640 and his Twitter and his Facebook at the  <br>00:25:48.360 time you literally you saw okay five  <br>00:25:51.399 likes 10 likes th000 likes 5,000 likes  <br>00:25:54.399 15,000 likes I've literally videos of it  <br>00:25:56.520 just it was just incredible that reach  <br>00:25:59.679 and uh you know because that was you  <br>00:26:02.520 know I knew some older celebrities being  <br>00:26:04.480 Ireland is a small place right you know  <br>00:26:06.039 some of the old singers and actors and  <br>00:26:07.399 so on but um the the kind of kidy Markus  <br>00:26:11.640 I'm watching The Power of of the act the  <br>00:26:13.600 hive of activity and so on but  <br>00:26:16.120 interestingly it was the day of the  <br>00:26:18.080 launch of the album people were  <br>00:26:20.600 delighted to by the album and then they  <br>00:26:21.960 complained like helled spending 99 cents  <br>00:26:24.120 on a set of emojis so our guys are  <br>00:26:27.279 watching this we're saying okay well  <br>00:26:28.480 we'll do a competition if you get you  <br>00:26:30.679 know 50 likes we'll send it to you for  <br>00:26:32.120 free kind of stuff and but it was just  <br>00:26:35.080 uh just did not work the whole thing all  <br>00:26:37.919 the work everything it just didn't work  <br>00:26:39.640 and and we thought we'd leverage the  <br>00:26:42.399 love that he has from the audience and  <br>00:26:44.440 so on and uh sorry now but um it just it  <br>00:26:49.480 helped reinforce probably his album  <br>00:26:51.039 sales so I'm sure he did well out of it  <br>00:26:52.640 but as a business I think it made about  <br>00:26:54.679 20 grand and it didn't it didn't cover  <br>00:26:57.200 anything at all um another one I had was  <br>00:27:00.640 was a takeaway from that you know you  <br>00:27:01.960 sat there and you know if you had to go  <br>00:27:04.039 back and do that again was that you  <br>00:27:05.320 learning that um the youngsters 999  <br>00:27:08.600 cents was just a step too much for them  <br>00:27:10.720 after buying the album or yeah I mean  <br>00:27:13.640 it's it's it's really about the power of  <br>00:27:16.080 the grow to Market strategy uh I'm not  <br>00:27:18.720 particularly adapt at thinking like a  <br>00:27:20.240 12-year-old girl and nor do I want to be  <br>00:27:23.000 um and but that's what it took to know  <br>00:27:24.919 if this was a good idea or not  <br>00:27:26.360 technically it worked beautifully  <br>00:27:28.679 integrated beautifully it was aligned  <br>00:27:30.799 brand on on point and on message all of  <br>00:27:33.360 those bits were absolutely right and you  <br>00:27:34.960 never know where the weak point is going  <br>00:27:36.600 to be and the weak point was in the  <br>00:27:39.279 acceptance of a 99 Cents purchase uh by  <br>00:27:43.240 by a 12-year-old fan and you just didn't  <br>00:27:48.360 get it do we didn't catch it and that's  <br>00:27:49.919 the go to market piece so and this  <br>00:27:52.320 happens very frequently with with  <br>00:27:54.640 technology-led startups they nail  <br>00:27:57.320 something new they do an amazing  <br>00:27:58.760 technical job of looking at something  <br>00:28:00.480 and and saying this is a brand new way  <br>00:28:01.960 of doing it but what they don't do is  <br>00:28:05.200 they connect it to the customer in in in  <br>00:28:07.880 the customer's terms and I suppose the  <br>00:28:10.000 lesson of that was doing it in a  <br>00:28:12.320 digestible way by the customer rather  <br>00:28:14.080 than what we thought they needed to hear  <br>00:28:16.039 or that we thought they wanted and  <br>00:28:18.360 sometimes you're inventing out of  <br>00:28:19.240 nothing so like here's a surprise thing  <br>00:28:21.080 same as an mden launch here's also an  <br>00:28:22.600 emoji go celebrate Nile didn't  <br>00:28:25.480 work interesting now  <br>00:28:28.760 how many how many startups have you got  <br>00:28:30.360 involved with if you count them in total  <br>00:28:33.000 oh uh 20 over the years and how many did  <br>00:28:37.399 you to choose 20 how many did you have  <br>00:28:39.960 come across your desk I'd love to be  <br>00:28:43.039 very strategic and say oh 700 in my team  <br>00:28:45.840 but up up until about three years ago  <br>00:28:47.679 I'd say I anything that came across my  <br>00:28:49.559 desk that I worked on um I I was  <br>00:28:52.440 involving in one way or other because I  <br>00:28:54.000 had a vicious appetite for but part of  <br>00:28:56.240 that process was consuming them to sort  <br>00:28:58.559 of go yeah it's never going to work and  <br>00:29:00.600 fine-tuning that process for myself and  <br>00:29:02.840 bringing people along in that process  <br>00:29:04.880 but very interesting when when covid  <br>00:29:06.880 happened and agency work diminished uh  <br>00:29:09.880 you know obviously because like we still  <br>00:29:12.480 had Nissan as a client I remember they  <br>00:29:13.799 rang me to say we haven't sold a car in  <br>00:29:15.679 six months you know and we need to  <br>00:29:17.159 reverse the project we were going to do  <br>00:29:18.919 but we'll talk to you later you can't  <br>00:29:20.760 blame anybody we had we had hotels we  <br>00:29:22.880 had Hotel kid out so you we went like  <br>00:29:25.279 this and then when the pandemic was over  <br>00:29:28.640 we accelerated through the roof we came  <br>00:29:30.080 up we gave free Consulting during the  <br>00:29:32.480 pandemic because I wanted to keep the  <br>00:29:34.240 people um it took a hit on balance  <br>00:29:36.600 sheets and so on but it meant that we  <br>00:29:38.559 were saying to our customers we'll give  <br>00:29:40.080 you free strategy free advice bit of  <br>00:29:41.799 technical support but remember us after  <br>00:29:43.480 the fact and and that's you know it came  <br>00:29:45.880 back with a vengeance so even when I had  <br>00:29:47.960 a a weak balance sheet on one agency the  <br>00:29:50.399 book of business came back with a  <br>00:29:51.480 flourish and it sold that on the up as  <br>00:29:53.159 well and that's another thing about  <br>00:29:54.799 selling is is the timing of of those  <br>00:29:56.840 sales but but  <br>00:29:59.000 um during the pandemic I put out a note  <br>00:30:01.720 on social media on LinkedIn and Twitter  <br>00:30:03.519 and so on to say in the spirit of  <br>00:30:06.039 everyone trying to help everybody uh and  <br>00:30:08.760 I had free time H I'm I'm willing to  <br>00:30:11.159 offer free half hour Zoom calls to  <br>00:30:14.200 anyone with a with a challenge or  <br>00:30:15.720 problem or to to fellow CEOs or  <br>00:30:18.320 entrepreneurs who would just wanted to  <br>00:30:19.600 talk I said the Only Rule was you're not  <br>00:30:21.799 LED sell to me I'm not alled to sell to  <br>00:30:23.320 you it's just a well met occasion where  <br>00:30:24.880 you can you can cry you can talk you you  <br>00:30:26.799 can do whatever and that was was  <br>00:30:28.880 fascinating to me I learned more about  <br>00:30:30.640 just you know I had CEOs on there who  <br>00:30:33.240 had you know a thousand people and  <br>00:30:35.720 suddenly they're literally told okay you  <br>00:30:37.799 you now need 20 people just to wind down  <br>00:30:40.279 the system to let everybody go and they  <br>00:30:42.519 find it hard looking in the mirror you  <br>00:30:43.880 know things of that I other on where you  <br>00:30:45.519 had a a 19-year-old saying I've got this  <br>00:30:47.720 great idea for Tech how do I engage the  <br>00:30:49.480 world and it's such a big answer you're  <br>00:30:52.600 like trying to break it down into  <br>00:30:53.919 meaningful chunks in an hour period of  <br>00:30:55.799 time to say well consider this first  <br>00:30:58.200 considered a second considered a third  <br>00:31:00.799 and the resistance to say go and get  <br>00:31:02.840 formal education before you try it  <br>00:31:04.519 because a lot of entrepreneurs don't  <br>00:31:05.960 want to do that they just want to get  <br>00:31:08.159 going um but then when I when I got more  <br>00:31:11.480 involved and I was kind of formerly  <br>00:31:13.559 chairman of a couple of these and it's  <br>00:31:15.120 easier to be an investment than a an  <br>00:31:16.760 investor than a chairman um I remember  <br>00:31:19.799 another instance a brilliant piece of  <br>00:31:21.200 tech too early to Market with a  <br>00:31:23.720 horrendous investor involved and the the  <br>00:31:28.120 damage I remember just trying to protect  <br>00:31:30.480 the startup team from that investor and  <br>00:31:33.120 he was taking finders fees for finding  <br>00:31:35.000 the money he was taking board seats all  <br>00:31:37.320 this kind of stuff he shall remain  <br>00:31:38.440 nameless but I remember this person  <br>00:31:41.360 would just in every board meeting just  <br>00:31:42.600 go on the attack because the CEO was  <br>00:31:44.600 young the COO were young they were the  <br>00:31:46.760 startup guys they were the the clever  <br>00:31:49.039 ones and this guy just no we need a  <br>00:31:52.039 50-year-old running that business you're  <br>00:31:53.840 terrible you're terrible and just attack  <br>00:31:55.440 attack attack and I would just spend the  <br>00:31:58.279 board meetings defending that person and  <br>00:32:00.919 and uh trying to find some kind of  <br>00:32:03.120 resonance be between people so again  <br>00:32:05.880 another weak point for a startup that  <br>00:32:07.279 you can't predict until you have the  <br>00:32:08.559 money and you're in flow and you don't  <br>00:32:10.880 expect it to be an internal problem you  <br>00:32:12.760 expect it to be the world connecting to  <br>00:32:14.600 the world is going to be the problem for  <br>00:32:15.919 the startups but it's a people game  <br>00:32:19.720 ultimately beay you to one of the  <br>00:32:21.440 property portals here in the UAE um I  <br>00:32:24.159 know the founders of that company and  <br>00:32:25.600 the parent company behind that wonderful  <br>00:32:27.559 human beings they have worked their ass  <br>00:32:31.159 off and I remember how long it took them  <br>00:32:33.639 to raise capital in the beginning now  <br>00:32:35.799 they're in a unicorn so they' done very  <br>00:32:37.399 well for themselves but I know the pain  <br>00:32:40.279 and I said to them you know what was it  <br>00:32:42.080 like at first and they went we were  <br>00:32:44.480 going to these these fundraising  <br>00:32:46.480 networking events and we went to a 100  <br>00:32:50.200 and we didn't know how to pitch MH we  <br>00:32:53.799 didn't know how to present we didn't  <br>00:32:55.639 really know what we were talking about  <br>00:32:57.720 and and it was after 100 events around  <br>00:33:01.559 that number that someone contacted them  <br>00:33:04.679 that had been at one of those events a  <br>00:33:06.080 few months earlier and that's where they  <br>00:33:08.480 got their first fund raise from they  <br>00:33:10.200 bootstrapped until then and I'm like did  <br>00:33:13.720 you just not know what you were doing  <br>00:33:15.240 they're like we didn't have a clue  <br>00:33:16.399 Spence we like genuinely didn't have a  <br>00:33:18.159 clue one of them one was at MIT the one  <br>00:33:21.120 was at Ox one was at cambrid super well  <br>00:33:22.760 educated people so you know all  <br>00:33:25.120 self-funded one was a finance guy one  <br>00:33:27.320 was a tech guy the other one was you  <br>00:33:28.840 know a marketing guy so and they're  <br>00:33:31.559 three brothers and so the trust was  <br>00:33:33.519 there and they're complimenting each  <br>00:33:34.799 other in terms of the skill sets was  <br>00:33:36.559 there um but none of them know what they  <br>00:33:38.919 were doing they look back on that now  <br>00:33:41.679 and they they're like it was just  <br>00:33:43.360 bloody-minded persistence that  <br>00:33:45.279 eventually got us there and I'm like had  <br>00:33:47.360 you known how to sell your concept sell  <br>00:33:49.960 your idea had you known how to genuinely  <br>00:33:52.559 build relationships and network with  <br>00:33:54.399 people what would be different they're  <br>00:33:56.679 like it would have been like is  <br>00:33:58.279 different yeah how often do you see  <br>00:34:01.000 entrepreneurs come to you that actually  <br>00:34:04.399 do have a good idea do have a good  <br>00:34:07.159 business they've started but just don't  <br>00:34:08.918 know how to verbalize it create a deck  <br>00:34:12.800 present it deliver it be passionate sell  <br>00:34:15.639 it essentially so that they can raise  <br>00:34:17.399 capital is that very frequent for you  <br>00:34:19.359 very frequent  <br>00:34:21.399 um the the very nature of what we've  <br>00:34:23.839 built in continuous Ventures now is  <br>00:34:25.760 we've got what's called A disruption un  <br>00:34:27.719 elligence team and that's all of these  <br>00:34:29.918 senior people that I used to make  <br>00:34:31.320 available every other Thursday in my my  <br>00:34:33.320 old instance of of companies we now have  <br>00:34:36.280 those people working full-time to  <br>00:34:38.159 support our Investment Portfolio and our  <br>00:34:40.119 startups and one of the big parts of  <br>00:34:42.879 their job is to reinforce any of the  <br>00:34:44.719 weak points that they see with anybody  <br>00:34:47.239 so you'll get superb technologists who  <br>00:34:50.520 like I say couldn't talk to a pretty  <br>00:34:52.000 girl or marketing person who can't  <br>00:34:54.119 explain a balance sheet or you know  <br>00:34:56.399 somebody who who won't understand why a  <br>00:34:58.920 particular color might be offensive in a  <br>00:35:00.440 certain territory if they're trying to  <br>00:35:01.680 sell it or things like that and you just  <br>00:35:03.839 never know where the weak points are so  <br>00:35:05.280 our team wrap themselves around those  <br>00:35:07.960 entrepreneurs to kind of make them as as  <br>00:35:11.440 copper fastened as possible on the  <br>00:35:13.040 journey so we see that every single day  <br>00:35:15.800 but it's not about oh that's not going  <br>00:35:18.240 to work because you're not the right guy  <br>00:35:19.760 to see this through I mean we've  <br>00:35:21.800 recalibrated firms in the past where the  <br>00:35:25.280 CEO is clearly not going to be you know  <br>00:35:27.240 you you get start of two two people one  <br>00:35:29.160 of them is the CEO right and you're like  <br>00:35:30.680 soly they're like LinkedIn I'm a CEO and  <br>00:35:32.440 director and it goes straight to their  <br>00:35:34.079 head and you're just like okay well what  <br>00:35:36.200 what oh you know we we um we do social  <br>00:35:38.920 media posts for a living you know that's  <br>00:35:40.760 that's our business but you look at them  <br>00:35:42.480 see look Le let's be frank you're not a  <br>00:35:45.079 CEO material but you're a brilliant  <br>00:35:46.880 Chief Innovation officer or you're great  <br>00:35:48.560 you're an ideas man or I mean we took  <br>00:35:50.760 one firm uh a couple years ago and we we  <br>00:35:53.240 recalibrated an an eight-year startup  <br>00:35:56.599 that had a patent and had a CEO who was  <br>00:35:59.240 tired and and a little begrudging that  <br>00:36:01.640 it hadn't gone better for him and we  <br>00:36:03.839 recalibrated moved him  <br>00:36:05.920 from Ireland where he was trying to  <br>00:36:08.359 Target um he was trying to Target the UK  <br>00:36:11.560 so we moved him into the region he was  <br>00:36:13.160 trying to Target registered a fresh  <br>00:36:15.040 company moved the patent and then re  <br>00:36:18.119 repositioned him as a Dyson type  <br>00:36:20.240 character he was like this is a new  <br>00:36:21.800 green startup with a full-time inventor  <br>00:36:24.960 then the interest came and that was  <br>00:36:28.160 pretty much the price of registering a  <br>00:36:29.680 firm and a little bit of message but how  <br>00:36:32.480 it was perceived by the market was where  <br>00:36:34.720 the secret sauce starts coming in  <br>00:36:36.160 suddenly you've got you know the same  <br>00:36:38.240 story told differently but now there's  <br>00:36:40.560 an appetite for it and it it kind of  <br>00:36:42.800 comes down you know the they say with  <br>00:36:44.560 the startups you know whether whether  <br>00:36:46.319 it's um luck or perseverance or after 10  <br>00:36:50.200 years in overnight success or any of  <br>00:36:52.040 this but you often hear this thing of  <br>00:36:54.079 fake it till you make it I don't believe  <br>00:36:56.280 in that for a second  <br>00:36:58.200 because faking it till you make it seems  <br>00:37:00.720 like Chancery seems like you're you're  <br>00:37:02.720 pretending you're worthwhile and then  <br>00:37:04.240 suddenly it might happen for you I from  <br>00:37:06.880 you believe in Project it then grow into  <br>00:37:09.359 that projection then project again grow  <br>00:37:11.160 into that projection again because it's  <br>00:37:12.839 driving yourself it's putting a future  <br>00:37:15.240 path there it's assuming success and  <br>00:37:18.000 it's not apologetic there's no imposter  <br>00:37:19.960 syndrome there's not anything that like  <br>00:37:22.079 oh thank God we got that deal or thank  <br>00:37:23.839 God they believed in us enough to sign a  <br>00:37:26.000 contract you're just saying I'm headed  <br>00:37:27.839 there who's with me it's a much more  <br>00:37:30.000 powerful message and then that means  <br>00:37:32.480 that you in in a technology firm or in a  <br>00:37:35.480 logistics firm or a data firm you're  <br>00:37:37.599 still putting people first the  <br>00:37:39.079 connection with the customer and your  <br>00:37:41.040 connection with the staff and and  <br>00:37:42.400 marrying those two things and uh you I  <br>00:37:45.920 think that's where the secret sauce in  <br>00:37:47.400 any of these startups  <br>00:37:49.520 lies interesting  <br>00:37:53.520 okay first of I'm going to ask this  <br>00:37:55.560 question because I know there's going to  <br>00:37:56.640 be a really great answer to this but  <br>00:37:58.960 before I ask the question let's give  <br>00:38:00.200 some context here you're you're a big  <br>00:38:02.000 fan of iido yes how long have you been  <br>00:38:04.400 doing Aikido for I started Aikido  <br>00:38:06.960 shortly after starting Continuum so  <br>00:38:08.800 would have been about 2003 okay I had  <br>00:38:11.040 done different martial arts but I had  <br>00:38:12.400 also been injured so I I took a break  <br>00:38:14.960 and then I took it up full-time in 2003  <br>00:38:18.200 what is  <br>00:38:20.000 iido uh what is aido so it's a Japanese  <br>00:38:22.760 martial arts form but it's it's um while  <br>00:38:26.599 it's full Conta  <br>00:38:27.960 it's designed to be a peaceful martial  <br>00:38:30.800 art so understanding the physics of the  <br>00:38:33.520 body the philosophy of movement the  <br>00:38:35.800 philosophy of solving Conflict by  <br>00:38:37.720 blending with conflict centrifugal kind  <br>00:38:40.480 of movements and so on it's it's really  <br>00:38:43.040 designed to be a living breathing  <br>00:38:45.000 martial art as opposed to clashing with  <br>00:38:46.800 something so what I'd have is you know  <br>00:38:50.200 um historically I did Ninjutsu I did  <br>00:38:52.920 Karate I did aido with Ninjutsu if  <br>00:38:55.839 someone tried to hit you over the head  <br>00:38:56.880 with an iron bar  <br>00:38:58.280 you they teach how to dislocate the arm  <br>00:39:00.280 right pretty violent pretty aggressive  <br>00:39:02.520 in Kempo they'd say here this is how you  <br>00:39:04.760 snap a block and you might hurt your arm  <br>00:39:06.960 but at least it's not your head in iido  <br>00:39:09.440 they say firstly as a guyy swinging down  <br>00:39:11.400 a bar at you don't be  <br>00:39:14.319 there and secondly see he's got he's  <br>00:39:16.680 gone to all this effort and all this  <br>00:39:18.319 energy to attack you why not manipulate  <br>00:39:21.160 that and redistribute it into the  <br>00:39:22.640 universe and get on with your life you  <br>00:39:24.520 know and when I say don't be there the B  <br>00:39:26.680 the best marshal is to not physically be  <br>00:39:28.800 there to recognize the signs that's  <br>00:39:31.040 Brewing over there so girlfriend let's  <br>00:39:33.440 go we walk out the door but if an attack  <br>00:39:36.480 comes to understand the physics of that  <br>00:39:38.920 motion and the little telltale signs you  <br>00:39:41.440 see in people to understand the  <br>00:39:43.640 aggression to understand the movement  <br>00:39:45.079 and then blend with it you know the best  <br>00:39:47.319 way to kill an enemy as sunu we were  <br>00:39:49.520 joking about sunsu earlier is to make  <br>00:39:51.480 them your friend it's the biggest way to  <br>00:39:52.920 evaporate an enemy so if you blend with  <br>00:39:55.079 an attack the attack disappears and  <br>00:39:57.560 that's kind of the philosophy behind the  <br>00:40:00.200 the physicality of iido and I think the  <br>00:40:03.280 this it was one of those things where as  <br>00:40:06.280 I got to know it and I got to practice  <br>00:40:08.200 it it just suited my mindset and it felt  <br>00:40:11.119 like it was kind of a a missing spine in  <br>00:40:13.760 the Journey of my life it kind of  <br>00:40:15.359 connected some significant points in my  <br>00:40:17.560 life and it just made sense it was about  <br>00:40:20.240 blending with things instead of classing  <br>00:40:21.920 with things it changed your tone of  <br>00:40:23.760 voice it changed how you if you took it  <br>00:40:25.760 in you know if it really meant something  <br>00:40:27.400 to you the kind of underlying concept of  <br>00:40:30.800 Bushido is life in every breath and how  <br>00:40:34.520 that translated for me into into life  <br>00:40:36.960 and then into business was be deliberate  <br>00:40:40.280 we're having a conversation I'm looking  <br>00:40:41.800 not looking at my phone we're having cup  <br>00:40:43.920 of tea we're enjoying the tea if we're  <br>00:40:45.560 doing Japanese archery look at the focus  <br>00:40:48.000 that they have in that it was just about  <br>00:40:49.880 being deliberate in the moment and being  <br>00:40:52.160 free to to really really appreciate that  <br>00:40:54.319 moment and it's something I've  <br>00:40:55.359 definitely applied to life it's  <br>00:40:56.520 something I've definitely applied to  <br>00:40:57.720 work and even the guys in continuous  <br>00:40:59.839 ventes would slag me that's you know I'm  <br>00:41:01.640 overusing the word deliberate but you  <br>00:41:04.040 know even the work is like is what we're  <br>00:41:05.760 doing on purpose can it be challenged  <br>00:41:08.160 can it be defended and these are  <br>00:41:09.800 questions the startups need to hear as  <br>00:41:11.240 well as well as being a human going  <br>00:41:13.640 through this process every single part  <br>00:41:16.240 of our business process has to be  <br>00:41:17.960 measured kpi defended qualified so then  <br>00:41:21.000 it moves through to different phases but  <br>00:41:23.160 certainly for my own life it made it  <br>00:41:26.920 made a lot of sense and probably solved  <br>00:41:29.560 things in me you know um that I was  <br>00:41:32.040 struggling with fear and and you know a  <br>00:41:34.640 history of being bullied and all these  <br>00:41:36.319 things that you can choose to set down  <br>00:41:38.880 over time if you if you address it  <br>00:41:41.880 correctly you know you you talk about  <br>00:41:44.280 being bullied but you're sitting here  <br>00:41:45.800 opposite me and we're worried about the  <br>00:41:47.839 legs being too tall on the chair because  <br>00:41:49.560 you're you're you're you're you're a  <br>00:41:51.000 giant of a man you're you know did that  <br>00:41:54.480 that kind of and and and I'm sure when  <br>00:41:56.160 you were younger you you were probably  <br>00:41:58.200 tall and skinny as opposed to being tall  <br>00:42:00.800 and Broad yeah I was I was a clumsy  <br>00:42:02.920 puppy big feet B hands so so how old  <br>00:42:07.319 were you when you started kind of like  <br>00:42:08.720 to fill out and start to become this the  <br>00:42:10.880 strapping kind of guy you are now well  <br>00:42:13.160 thank you for noticing  <br>00:42:14.800 uh I was is that a chat upline or  <br>00:42:17.400 something yeah did you get with that  <br>00:42:19.720 recorded um I was probably I was being  <br>00:42:23.160 extremely badly badly bullied um I had  <br>00:42:26.359 an older brother who was who was uh  <br>00:42:28.359 rather rather intense and wired wrong um  <br>00:42:31.760 so I was being bullied at at home when  <br>00:42:33.760 my parents were there my parents were  <br>00:42:35.520 amazing um both work fulltime to put us  <br>00:42:37.880 into private school so they were often  <br>00:42:39.640 not there H and uh my brother was was a  <br>00:42:42.880 tough not and in the spirit of healing  <br>00:42:44.680 through understanding I think he was  <br>00:42:45.960 bullied by his friends or certainly the  <br>00:42:47.680 weak one in his group so he used to take  <br>00:42:49.680 it out of me um but it just meant then  <br>00:42:52.480 that I was going to school feeling you  <br>00:42:54.839 know vulnerable and I used to have to go  <br>00:42:57.200 go through City Center in Dublin in a  <br>00:42:59.079 private school uniform through the the  <br>00:43:01.960 the kind of working class areas from the  <br>00:43:03.520 from the railway stations and so on with  <br>00:43:05.760 like a tin Whistler recorder sticking  <br>00:43:07.319 out of side and so it was fair game  <br>00:43:09.319 right to the neighborhood and then I get  <br>00:43:11.359 into class and you know you'd kind of  <br>00:43:13.240 put your cat and you go back to your  <br>00:43:14.559 desk and your bag is in the bin or  <br>00:43:16.400 there's chocolate over your it was just  <br>00:43:18.160 this  <br>00:43:19.319 ongoing you know mood I remember saying  <br>00:43:22.400 to my parents I really wanted to move  <br>00:43:23.680 school and when they drilled into it I  <br>00:43:25.599 couldn't admit I was being bullied I  <br>00:43:26.960 just just was trying to say because I  <br>00:43:29.559 just want to move schools I want to move  <br>00:43:30.800 schools I'm delighted I didn't and my  <br>00:43:32.200 parents were amazing about it I just  <br>00:43:34.559 never told them and then years later I  <br>00:43:37.920 was working on a book in Africa in 2008  <br>00:43:41.319 I think and I gave them the first draft  <br>00:43:43.440 and it was the first time I told him  <br>00:43:44.359 about what I'd been through and so on  <br>00:43:46.960 and uh I remember my dad God West was  <br>00:43:49.960 was really shocked had no idea you know  <br>00:43:53.200 and uh but so it culminated I got  <br>00:43:55.760 attacked one day my brother started  <br>00:43:57.440 smoking and he arranged for a guy to  <br>00:43:58.920 Ambush me with a knife pinned me against  <br>00:44:00.680 the wall I was like 13 and I froze  <br>00:44:03.480 completely froze and uh it's funny I can  <br>00:44:06.800 still remember now but I remember it was  <br>00:44:09.079 the freezing worried me more than  <br>00:44:10.559 anything else uh if the guy punched me  <br>00:44:13.200 or something that would have been  <br>00:44:14.240 probably easier uh I was playing rugby  <br>00:44:16.839 for school and so on so I was I I was  <br>00:44:19.359 tall so I couldn't not do rugby but I  <br>00:44:21.760 was uh when when something comes out of  <br>00:44:23.559 the universe and attacks you you can't  <br>00:44:25.079 rationalize that and it sat would me  <br>00:44:26.640 very bad  <br>00:44:28.400 um and they long story short about six  <br>00:44:29.800 months later of of worrying about that I  <br>00:44:32.200 I I stopped at a martial arts center on  <br>00:44:33.839 a Saturday and it was just these mixed  <br>00:44:36.640 various martial arts who' obviously  <br>00:44:38.000 taken a lease together and I I went in  <br>00:44:39.720 and it was Ninjutsu which is a very  <br>00:44:41.640 impressive gymnastic martial arts they  <br>00:44:44.040 were black they look cool it was like  <br>00:44:45.520 something out of the movies but I was  <br>00:44:47.280 still this nervous kid you know clumsy  <br>00:44:50.559 and and and and timid but I spoke to the  <br>00:44:54.680 the trainer afterwards and I I just went  <br>00:44:56.319 up and said look I don't want to do this  <br>00:44:57.359 or anything but can I just tell you I  <br>00:44:59.440 told him about what happened and I said  <br>00:45:01.079 can I how do you not freeze was the  <br>00:45:03.880 question basically I was kind of  <br>00:45:05.319 struggling to to get out and he just  <br>00:45:07.520 said look this people talk about fight  <br>00:45:09.599 and flight but it's actually fight  <br>00:45:11.000 flight and freeze and he said the the  <br>00:45:13.200 challenge is you'll always have the  <br>00:45:14.440 reaction you'll always be a freezer but  <br>00:45:16.480 you can learn to be switched on by it  <br>00:45:18.280 rather than switched off so the moment  <br>00:45:19.720 it happens you go you you move rather  <br>00:45:22.200 than freeze doesn't mean you haven't  <br>00:45:23.680 Frozen but you recognize the symptoms  <br>00:45:25.200 and off you go and I I I then went down  <br>00:45:29.119 the route of you know Ninjutsu and and  <br>00:45:31.720 Kempo and literally tournaments fighting  <br>00:45:33.760 and all this kind of stuff so built a  <br>00:45:36.200 pair of shoulders built a pair of arms  <br>00:45:38.160 had to run with my brother one time it  <br>00:45:39.680 was the last time he ever had to run  <br>00:45:41.000 with  <br>00:45:41.960 me and uh kind of built it out from  <br>00:45:44.319 there but I got that out of my system  <br>00:45:46.359 but very interestingly I became the kind  <br>00:45:48.040 of the anti-bully then if I saw kids  <br>00:45:49.839 getting bullied I'd step forward and you  <br>00:45:54.160 know it and it really helped me with  <br>00:45:55.880 with with work over over the years  <br>00:45:58.440 because I then start to antagonize  <br>00:46:00.720 because if things got violent I was kind  <br>00:46:03.040 of comfortable with that you know you're  <br>00:46:04.160 16 you're cocky then you have a chest  <br>00:46:05.760 and you feel like you're bulletproof but  <br>00:46:08.240 um you'd antagonize and then you'd look  <br>00:46:10.480 for the little nonverbal signs or the  <br>00:46:12.640 reactions and things like that you know  <br>00:46:14.200 you you'd see a guy going hell would you  <br>00:46:16.640 but he'd look around three people around  <br>00:46:18.400 him looking to be egged on or something  <br>00:46:20.559 and I found that piece absolutely  <br>00:46:22.280 fascinating the non-verbal piece and  <br>00:46:25.400 that's been a huge influence in in my  <br>00:46:27.559 life I even like when I watch the news I  <br>00:46:29.400 turn this the sound off and I just watch  <br>00:46:32.040 the politicians because they usually you  <br>00:46:34.400 know in a in a pressurized live  <br>00:46:36.440 environment trying to you know peacock  <br>00:46:38.440 or whatever they're doing and I just  <br>00:46:40.319 kept on watching for non-verbal cues  <br>00:46:42.720 which helped with martial arts because I  <br>00:46:45.319 you know I burnt out of the feir wasn't  <br>00:46:47.440 afraid of anything anymore so I can  <br>00:46:48.960 stand on the stage of 10,000 people now  <br>00:46:50.720 and you know not say boo it it doesn't  <br>00:46:53.480 bother me at all I played music any of  <br>00:46:55.680 these things I just in my write this now  <br>00:46:58.720 and again it was in the moment that kind  <br>00:47:00.960 of mindfulness not bringing anything  <br>00:47:03.359 else into it except for what I needed  <br>00:47:05.720 there and then you know I used to think  <br>00:47:07.520 of it like you know Newton's cradles  <br>00:47:09.359 those balls that go I used to in my mind  <br>00:47:12.480 I used to imagine I could just decide  <br>00:47:14.240 and they they'd just stop and start  <br>00:47:16.040 swinging together instead of clacking  <br>00:47:17.559 against each other and and that was I I  <br>00:47:19.599 I learn learned a phrase much later on  <br>00:47:21.800 called equipoise and it was just about  <br>00:47:24.359 that kind of centeredness and Stillness  <br>00:47:26.319 and so on it sounds a bit cliche but  <br>00:47:28.880 when you just decide okay this now and  <br>00:47:31.800 nothing else it comes to you that that  <br>00:47:35.040 that confidence and that that calmness  <br>00:47:37.079 and uh aido and Bushido that kind of  <br>00:47:39.839 philosophy just just sat with that well  <br>00:47:42.000 you know so that's kept me to this  <br>00:47:46.760 day for me it's trying  <br>00:47:49.400 to to  <br>00:47:51.599 take somebody who's been through an  <br>00:47:54.160 experience is taking on a martial art  <br>00:47:56.599 that's toughened him up he's then moved  <br>00:47:59.000 to another  <br>00:48:00.720 form and and then that form which seems  <br>00:48:03.880 like a a more as you as you describe a  <br>00:48:07.040 calmer um more thoughtful more flow  <br>00:48:09.640 inducing form  <br>00:48:12.119 and I can see how taken on the martial  <br>00:48:14.920 art at the beginning there potentially  <br>00:48:17.000 solved a problem and it was like I the  <br>00:48:20.559 freezing thing that I want to go there  <br>00:48:22.359 if that man can help me not freeze then  <br>00:48:24.520 that's that's the problem I'm trying to  <br>00:48:25.839 solve when when you look at businesses  <br>00:48:28.240 that you've built and you sold and ones  <br>00:48:29.520 that you've been involved with as well  <br>00:48:31.319 when you take on akido and its  <br>00:48:33.559 principles you talk about as you just  <br>00:48:35.760 said earlier deliberate okay so that's  <br>00:48:37.520 clearly something that's ingrained in  <br>00:48:39.280 you within within that that that that uh  <br>00:48:42.000 process that you  <br>00:48:44.520 apply do you find yourself watching  <br>00:48:48.119 People's lack of because you're so  <br>00:48:51.760 strong in your knowledge around does it  <br>00:48:54.160 do you understand what I mean that I do  <br>00:48:56.079 I do because to me it's kind of like  <br>00:48:57.799 that it's it's who you are so that that  <br>00:49:01.559 would make it almost like you could  <br>00:49:03.000 notice it so apparently to you when  <br>00:49:05.160 people and does it make you go okay he  <br>00:49:07.160 doesn't know this kind of stuff or does  <br>00:49:08.319 it make you go for goodness sake you  <br>00:49:10.880 donut yeah there's a bit of there's a  <br>00:49:13.079 bit of is that there's a bit of that I  <br>00:49:15.200 mean uh we had planned I hope he's not  <br>00:49:17.160 been with me yeah no no no no you're  <br>00:49:20.200 you're you're safe enough we're in a  <br>00:49:21.559 safe place safe place we had planned a  <br>00:49:24.559 Trilogy of books when I was working with  <br>00:49:26.240 an old friend friend of mine who's who's  <br>00:49:27.359 very sick now we can't we can't proceed  <br>00:49:28.920 with it but but we had decided on on on  <br>00:49:31.799 writing three books and the first one  <br>00:49:33.960 was called the tribe of one and it was  <br>00:49:35.359 about looking at because we're not  <br>00:49:37.079 qualified it was only philos philosophy  <br>00:49:39.280 it wasn't we're not qualified to go any  <br>00:49:41.160 deeper on it but we were just we did  <br>00:49:42.920 some work in Africa together we did some  <br>00:49:44.240 work in London together and we're just  <br>00:49:45.599 looking at people and watching people  <br>00:49:47.319 and you know you you'd watch you know  <br>00:49:50.240 Canary Warf at quarter 8 in the morning  <br>00:49:53.400 and you just see people running up a  <br>00:49:55.440 moving escalator and you know on their  <br>00:49:58.200 phone earphones and you just kind of  <br>00:50:00.520 wondering about how people see their own  <br>00:50:02.920 life and how they navigate through a day  <br>00:50:04.720 right and and what they don't do and  <br>00:50:06.599 what they don't stop to take in and I  <br>00:50:08.640 don't mean you know stare at the trees  <br>00:50:10.400 and and Forest bath or any of this stuff  <br>00:50:12.359 which is all amazing stuff but actually  <br>00:50:14.559 just are they given themselves a moment  <br>00:50:17.280 I mean one of the things I've enjoyed  <br>00:50:19.839 particularly after an exit is you have  <br>00:50:21.760 time in your day to think about your day  <br>00:50:24.160 not to think about what you have to get  <br>00:50:25.440 done you know I'm not you're a great  <br>00:50:27.960 early riser I mean you're you written  <br>00:50:30.359 the book on it by the time I see your  <br>00:50:32.440 Instagram post five hours has passed I'm  <br>00:50:34.559 like oh he's he's back from the desert  <br>00:50:36.040 already but you know I I'm I'm  <br>00:50:38.799 not but there's moments in my day  <br>00:50:40.960 there's waves in my day like I would  <br>00:50:42.240 only do email twice a week um I would  <br>00:50:45.480 only you know there's certain things I  <br>00:50:46.880 don't allow say that again because I  <br>00:50:48.599 don't think people would have picked  <br>00:50:49.680 that up you do emails twice a week yeah  <br>00:50:51.799 so I would have typically about two two  <br>00:50:54.640 hour Windows a week to do email  <br>00:50:57.680 I and that is the only time you would  <br>00:50:59.280 respond and Zend  <br>00:51:01.119 y consciously consciously deliberately  <br>00:51:04.079 like you if you email me you'll get an  <br>00:51:05.880 out of office saying you  <br>00:51:08.720 know in small Windows of time I'll be  <br>00:51:10.920 able to answer you but if here's an  <br>00:51:12.280 escalation process if it's something  <br>00:51:13.760 bigger I have an amazing assistant  <br>00:51:15.760 Sunshine hello but um it's it's just  <br>00:51:20.160 that's if I'm sitting at a desk I'm not  <br>00:51:21.599 doing my job really not and so you don't  <br>00:51:26.079 get moment  <br>00:51:27.520 you don't build energy you don't build  <br>00:51:29.280 teams you don't build resonance between  <br>00:51:31.040 teams by sending emails and so on in  <br>00:51:33.839 fact emails are usually after the fact  <br>00:51:35.480 when you're trying to catch things or  <br>00:51:37.160 blame things you know um when I was  <br>00:51:39.640 interviewing for the the dni team and  <br>00:51:42.040 and my partner column in continuous I  <br>00:51:45.079 was looking for extreme talent because  <br>00:51:47.200 we knew we we wanted to build a  <br>00:51:48.520 worldclass team and we knew they were  <br>00:51:50.200 all very very experienced people to  <br>00:51:52.720 people that I hoped I'd I'd struggle to  <br>00:51:54.799 interview because they were so good  <br>00:51:57.119 and and that's what I wanted I wanted to  <br>00:51:59.160 be the dumbest guy in that room as I  <br>00:52:00.680 said but I wasn't just looking at them  <br>00:52:03.000 from their extreme skill set are their  <br>00:52:05.280 extreme experience or perspective on the  <br>00:52:07.400 world I was looking at them seeing how  <br>00:52:09.160 would they resonate with another extreme  <br>00:52:11.720 person in another part of what we call  <br>00:52:14.040 the different lenses how we look at all  <br>00:52:16.319 of our deal flow all of these lenses  <br>00:52:18.720 design creativity data science quants  <br>00:52:20.839 everything they all look at anything we  <br>00:52:22.200 bring to the table and and bring if we  <br>00:52:25.200 if we commit to investing we bring bring  <br>00:52:26.680 that entrepreneur on the journey so it's  <br>00:52:29.000 how these people resonate with  <br>00:52:30.920 others and yeah you can sort of go right  <br>00:52:34.640 you look around and think oh I've got an  <br>00:52:35.920 advantage of you I've got an advantage  <br>00:52:37.000 of you but that's only if you're letting  <br>00:52:38.920 your ego trigger like you see those  <br>00:52:41.640 those little videos on on YouTube where  <br>00:52:43.960 you where the shark swins and all the  <br>00:52:45.400 fish avoid it all the time that's the  <br>00:52:47.520 that effect you'll end up being alone  <br>00:52:49.160 right you'll be of the Walk but you  <br>00:52:50.839 end up being alone because you're making  <br>00:52:52.760 it about you when you remove that and  <br>00:52:55.359 you make it about other people  <br>00:52:57.520 then things start to change and to me  <br>00:53:00.359 the most successful entrepreneurs that I  <br>00:53:02.000 see both the ones that are billionaires  <br>00:53:04.319 and the ones that are just starting off  <br>00:53:07.079 they're cam they're able to be  <br>00:53:09.200 comfortable around anybody they  <br>00:53:11.040 literally have that ability to what I  <br>00:53:13.119 call a network chameleon they they can  <br>00:53:14.680 kind of adapt and helps when you're  <br>00:53:16.440 talking about pitching and so on if I'm  <br>00:53:19.040 telling you about me I'm kind of failing  <br>00:53:21.240 the message here MH and it's that all  <br>00:53:23.200 that just people hate being sold to but  <br>00:53:25.280 they love buying you love to go in and  <br>00:53:27.319 say right there's a brand new car it's  <br>00:53:28.520 mine but you don't want the Slick guy  <br>00:53:30.000 going oh you'd look right in this sir  <br>00:53:31.839 you know saying you're allergic to that  <br>00:53:33.119 you go go away from me and but the more  <br>00:53:36.480 you blend with people the more you can  <br>00:53:37.680 adapt people and this is your language  <br>00:53:39.240 your framework um you I know you've  <br>00:53:41.760 you've talked to Chris Voss before he's  <br>00:53:43.480 a master in talking about mirroring and  <br>00:53:45.760 and making the conversation turning  <br>00:53:47.319 their own sentence on them again and  <br>00:53:49.720 again all of these tips and tricks help  <br>00:53:52.079 how you relate to people and then I'd  <br>00:53:54.559 always say there's two types of people  <br>00:53:55.920 in the world there drains and there  <br>00:53:57.400 radiators people who are exuding energy  <br>00:54:00.079 and other people who are just the room  <br>00:54:01.680 is empty with them in it and I don't do  <br>00:54:03.920 very well around  <br>00:54:06.200 drains that's fantastic okay um you  <br>00:54:09.599 recently moved to Dubai yes you've been  <br>00:54:11.640 here I think a few months now 108 days  <br>00:54:14.640 and you you came across a island and and  <br>00:54:17.280 and and you told me when we had the  <br>00:54:18.760 dinner that evening that you had sold  <br>00:54:21.720 everything moved here and bought nothing  <br>00:54:24.640 yep which seemed a little bit weird now  <br>00:54:27.760 I would I would I would suggest bought  <br>00:54:29.920 nothing whilst you're deciding what to  <br>00:54:31.720 buy maybe there there's a there's a  <br>00:54:33.520 reason for not but the Liberation that  <br>00:54:36.720 seemed to be in your eyes when you were  <br>00:54:38.599 explaining this to me at the time so can  <br>00:54:40.520 you just share that with me again and  <br>00:54:42.160 why did you do that and how does that  <br>00:54:43.599 feel well it it feels fantastic I mean  <br>00:54:46.960 you know firstly it was a nice exercise  <br>00:54:50.040 in in detaching from things so you you  <br>00:54:52.760 you you know has his cars and so on uh  <br>00:54:56.160 it it's nice to just shake all that off  <br>00:54:58.839 not even just from an operational point  <br>00:55:00.319 of view you know um but just from a a  <br>00:55:04.160 detached of of of feelings  <br>00:55:07.839 the sharing things with people is very  <br>00:55:10.200 very important and going through things  <br>00:55:12.440 with people are very important but like  <br>00:55:14.359 the last time I went back to duin I  <br>00:55:16.760 visited my my house which is now sold as  <br>00:55:20.160 well and uh it didn't feel like a home  <br>00:55:23.200 anymore and it was a very clear thing  <br>00:55:25.319 and it just reminded me that that was  <br>00:55:26.839 just stuff I actually pride myself on  <br>00:55:29.160 the stuff that I don't need I don't even  <br>00:55:30.720 have a car here or anything and uh it's  <br>00:55:33.599 just about my family now that will  <br>00:55:35.960 change over time because you know Dubai  <br>00:55:38.559 is lovely and there's lovely places to  <br>00:55:40.079 live and and and uh my kids want things  <br>00:55:42.799 and so on but as it stands currently  <br>00:55:45.240 granted I own Investments and companies  <br>00:55:47.280 and so on but that's all you know in a  <br>00:55:49.400 portfolio somewhere other than that I'm  <br>00:55:51.599 completely free and it's great and it  <br>00:55:54.039 just it just resets you and it reminds  <br>00:55:55.720 you that  <br>00:55:57.319 the people that are traveling with you  <br>00:55:58.680 and the moments you're going through are  <br>00:56:00.319 so much more important than stuff and  <br>00:56:02.440 stuff depreciates but people and  <br>00:56:04.680 relationships hopefully appreciate and  <br>00:56:07.359 just drives that point home to you the  <br>00:56:09.119 guy that's the founder of telegram Pavo  <br>00:56:11.680 I for what his surname he F he famously  <br>00:56:14.000 said in an interview he said I own  <br>00:56:15.319 nothing he said why would you want to  <br>00:56:17.240 own stuff like that it gets in the way  <br>00:56:19.000 of your freedom to be yeah I mean you  <br>00:56:21.799 you you made me struggle Z tell me to  <br>00:56:23.520 wear not a black T-shirt I literally  <br>00:56:25.400 just wear a black T-shirt every day I'm  <br>00:56:28.079 like this morning like what will I  <br>00:56:30.880 wear that was my biggest challenge you  <br>00:56:33.160 know  <br>00:56:34.000 yeah you've won some awards yeah when  <br>00:56:37.599 you win awards for the work that you do  <br>00:56:39.240 and I'll just I'll just

win you win these award  <br>00:57:05.240 and how does it feel to win  <br>00:57:09.000 Awards uh I think it's because you went  <br>00:57:11.599 to Career recently yes I did yeah South  <br>00:57:13.839 Korea yeah three weeks ago that was we  <br>00:57:17.319 could do a whole podcast on that  <br>00:57:19.039 experience yeah and that was L you that  <br>00:57:21.319 was that was we we were in the National  <br>00:57:23.799 Assembly and was presented an award  <br>00:57:26.760 um for our kind of ethical Investments  <br>00:57:29.240 our ESG Investments for continuous

and we're moving very fast  <br>00:57:39.240 but that was very touching the welcome  <br>00:57:41.039 we got was very touching uh myself and  <br>00:57:43.039 the team were were all uh greatly  <br>00:57:45.599 received and um one of our client  <br>00:57:47.559 Investments was also won an award and  <br>00:57:49.839 Paul he was amazing um yeah it was funny  <br>00:57:54.240 I it was funny for me because I was so  <br>00:57:56.200 so far from Ireland and Ireland's a  <br>00:57:58.720 small place but it seems to get  <br>00:58:00.119 connected everywhere and we met with the  <br>00:58:01.720 ambassador to Ireland there and you know  <br>00:58:04.400 I wore a green tie on purpose and things  <br>00:58:06.440 like that you know my dad would have  <br>00:58:07.960 been proud and it was it was a nice it  <br>00:58:10.839 was a really nice uh occasion um when  <br>00:58:14.799 you when you win Awards I remember my  <br>00:58:17.319 first award was in 2003 I won best new  <br>00:58:19.839 internet ENT entrepreneur in Ireland H  <br>00:58:22.480 it was called the net Visionary award  <br>00:58:25.160 and uh on the night my parents were with  <br>00:58:28.039 me and I remember they said and the  <br>00:58:30.000 winter is I was sitting there my my  <br>00:58:31.880 probably rented tuxedo at the time and I  <br>00:58:34.559 remember my my my um fingers crossed  <br>00:58:37.240 like this and my head down and it was  <br>00:58:38.760 they were going through you know the  <br>00:58:39.880 finalists and a little profile of them  <br>00:58:42.400 and the winner is and I remember getting  <br>00:58:44.000 hit by this kind of wave of loneliness  <br>00:58:46.520 like nobody was going through this with  <br>00:58:48.000 me this wasn't significant for anyone  <br>00:58:49.640 else except for me and I remember  <br>00:58:52.680 carrying that feeling up on the side one  <br>00:58:54.319 and I I remember carrying that feeling  <br>00:58:55.480 up on the stage just going who that that  <br>00:58:57.440 actually feels really  <br>00:58:58.680 empty but those spider awards for  <br>00:59:01.599 example they I give credit to them  <br>00:59:04.160 completely to the staff that I worked  <br>00:59:05.880 with the teams that I worked with  <br>00:59:07.160 because I remember one of our clients we  <br>00:59:09.160 won a huge um spider award for them for  <br>00:59:12.599 best e-commerce  <br>00:59:14.680 in uh in England or the United Kingdom I  <br>00:59:17.319 think and it was a big deal and their  <br>00:59:19.280 marketing director was with us and she  <br>00:59:21.039 had a review the next day so I said here  <br>00:59:22.880 just walk in and plunk that on the desk  <br>00:59:25.160 so for them it was great stamps in their  <br>00:59:26.920 CV uh I think when you're when you're  <br>00:59:29.400 building  <br>00:59:31.000 companies you you only kind of you never  <br>00:59:33.680 really stop to to smell the roses you're  <br>00:59:35.760 always looking about you forget about  <br>00:59:37.440 what you've done well and you just focus  <br>00:59:38.799 on what of the next challenges and  <br>00:59:40.119 there's always more challenges right and  <br>00:59:41.680 there's always more things to do but  <br>00:59:43.680 those things they they force you to look  <br>00:59:46.480 around look look your teammates in the  <br>00:59:48.319 eye and toasted glass champ Pages we  <br>00:59:49.960 bloody dter and you know we have a ways  <br>00:59:52.319 to go yet but it's it's there's nice  <br>00:59:54.359 recognition um and some of the I I kept  <br>00:59:56.720 some of them just nostalgically um here  <br>00:59:59.520 as I say of nothing but I could a couple  <br>01:00:01.760 of those are in the office here in Dubai  <br>01:00:03.319 now as well is there something when you  <br>01:00:05.720 go back and and it doesn't matter which  <br>01:00:07.599 part of your life because it could be  <br>01:00:09.119 childhood as well but is there something  <br>01:00:11.920 that you weren't recognized for that  <br>01:00:14.960 still to this day sits in your mind and  <br>01:00:17.400 you wish you  <br>01:00:19.319 were uh I definitely being very honest  <br>01:00:24.200 and personal I definitely struggled for  <br>01:00:26.119 having an older brother really care for  <br>01:00:28.000 me and I definitely noticed that it  <br>01:00:30.079 meant that I responded to older people  <br>01:00:32.039 better which I think became a strength  <br>01:00:34.280 over time but but back then you just  <br>01:00:36.720 wanted your older brother to you know  <br>01:00:38.160 rub your hair and say he loved you and  <br>01:00:39.440 so on and we never had that relationship  <br>01:00:41.400 unfortunately um and even I remember  <br>01:00:44.079 seeing in school reports it would say I  <br>01:00:47.400 didn't really care about my peer  <br>01:00:50.000 feedback I was looking for the teachers  <br>01:00:52.000 feedback or you know U supervisors or  <br>01:00:54.359 things like that and uh you know in  <br>01:00:56.880 whatever way we get a we become a  <br>01:00:59.000 patchwork quilt as as I me our kind of  <br>01:01:01.920 construct over time that was certainly  <br>01:01:04.119 something I was I was more comfortable  <br>01:01:05.720 and more interested in older people  <br>01:01:08.359 generally um and I I think it it kind of  <br>01:01:11.079 worked like at 21 I was presenting in  <br>01:01:12.760 the boardrooms of IBM in Dublin and  <br>01:01:15.240 purely because I could create PowerPoint  <br>01:01:16.720 it wasn't because of my great great  <br>01:01:18.240 strategic thoughts I could just make it  <br>01:01:19.680 look Do  <br>01:01:20.680 It um and but I learned a lot about  <br>01:01:23.240 politics I learned a lot about you know  <br>01:01:25.359 middle Mar management you know silos of  <br>01:01:28.880 power and protection and all that kind  <br>01:01:30.160 of stuff and and I really really fought  <br>01:01:31.760 to make sure there was no politics or  <br>01:01:33.280 in any company I was involved  <br>01:01:35.200 with or anything that I built and even  <br>01:01:37.640 now if you looked at our our dni team  <br>01:01:40.440 we've we've got three teams in continus  <br>01:01:42.039 with have a partners team the the  <br>01:01:43.319 disruption intelligence team and then  <br>01:01:44.799 what we call client Partners who are the  <br>01:01:46.880 main principles of anything we invest in  <br>01:01:49.520 but when you look at the dni team which  <br>01:01:51.000 is our kind of Secret Sauce that's a  <br>01:01:53.079 circular team where they're all facing  <br>01:01:54.279 each other and the process goes through  <br>01:01:56.000 the middle of them their our lenses on  <br>01:01:57.720 the world and their job is to be a  <br>01:02:00.200 rising tide to anything they touch and  <br>01:02:02.799 we get to include them we get to bring  <br>01:02:05.839 them along on our journey we we we can  <br>01:02:07.839 focus on making them wealthy over time  <br>01:02:09.680 because we can make them shareholders of  <br>01:02:11.319 the things we invest in if they're  <br>01:02:13.599 subject matter experts in those areas we  <br>01:02:15.440 can we've our internal share a scheme so  <br>01:02:18.039 they their job is to be good for society  <br>01:02:21.200 is to bring the next generation of  <br>01:02:23.279 business of of an ethical investment  <br>01:02:25.920 it's not all ethical Essence we're not  <br>01:02:27.839 Saints either it's not our mandate it  <br>01:02:29.799 just happens to really suit how we see  <br>01:02:32.279 the  <br>01:02:33.000 world but they're a very motivated  <br>01:02:35.119 talented team that um it's a privilege  <br>01:02:38.400 when you get to handpick everyone you  <br>01:02:39.640 work with so you you can't take that  <br>01:02:41.880 privilege for granted you have to really  <br>01:02:43.680 really focus on that and make it about  <br>01:02:45.599 them not make it about you so even in my  <br>01:02:48.480 last uh in my last instance as as  <br>01:02:52.240 CEO um I did this um murf business  <br>01:02:56.359 school leadership training thing and to  <br>01:02:58.160 do this psychometric testing very very  <br>01:03:00.400 intense prism psychometric testing and I  <br>01:03:03.599 just gave I gave it to all the senior  <br>01:03:05.640 team and I said There You Go warts and  <br>01:03:07.440 all very vulnerable thing to do but  <br>01:03:09.359 again you know I said the better you  <br>01:03:12.160 understand this the better you can use  <br>01:03:13.160 me as a business tool so that's if you  <br>01:03:16.160 see my eyes rolling in the back of my  <br>01:03:17.640 head it's because of that weed Point not  <br>01:03:19.079 because it's me you know but to them  <br>01:03:21.640 they got the point is just like okay  <br>01:03:22.880 this is a very Frank relationship we're  <br>01:03:24.359 having here and it's the one thing I  <br>01:03:25.839 insist on with the guys we work with is  <br>01:03:28.200 be very direct be very Frank don't coat  <br>01:03:30.799 sugarcoat things because if you get this  <br>01:03:33.000 decision wrong for us we're in a lovely  <br>01:03:35.720 environment it's it's a a privileged air  <br>01:03:38.160 and and we get to work with amazing  <br>01:03:39.599 talent and so on but for the  <br>01:03:41.760 entrepreneurs coming through the the  <br>01:03:43.440 place quite often private equity and  <br>01:03:45.520 Venture Capital they go you oh you want  <br>01:03:47.160 our a couple of million Kiss the Ring  <br>01:03:48.640 here and so on but if you think of the  <br>01:03:52.319 emotional Journey a lot of entrepreneurs  <br>01:03:54.039 go through this could be their one Moon  <br>01:03:55.960 they could have given up the day job  <br>01:03:57.359 spent their savings and they arrive  <br>01:03:59.279 exhausted at our door so we say they're  <br>01:04:02.400 our customer and and treat them with  <br>01:04:04.559 emotional intelligence it is it's a it's  <br>01:04:06.640 a human game but you you have to treat  <br>01:04:10.400 them with emotional intelligence even if  <br>01:04:12.039 you know you're dealing with somebody  <br>01:04:13.359 who's brilliant and heavily on the  <br>01:04:15.319 Spectrum and you look at them and  <br>01:04:16.960 they're lightning in a jar and they just  <br>01:04:19.119 can't express themselves to you you  <br>01:04:20.760 still have to make it about you to  <br>01:04:22.520 connect with them and I think that's a  <br>01:04:24.599 very worthy challenge particularly when  <br>01:04:26.680 you have all these different lenses that  <br>01:04:28.440 mean we need to connect to that person  <br>01:04:30.079 in different ways to make them  <br>01:04:32.079 potentially successful investing is a  <br>01:04:34.200 very very Risky Business particularly  <br>01:04:35.760 with startups so what we're doing is  <br>01:04:37.559 trying to drisk that by creating fully  <br>01:04:40.119 evolved CEOs through that journey and if  <br>01:04:42.839 not we reserve the right typically in  <br>01:04:45.359 our structures to bring them on the  <br>01:04:47.279 journey but if we say look we need to  <br>01:04:48.559 put a CEO above you and you focus on  <br>01:04:51.440 your strength your power and this person  <br>01:04:53.119 will be a commercial person they'll  <br>01:04:54.520 worry about the day today you just focus  <br>01:04:57.799 on your Brilliance and let's bring that  <br>01:04:59.240 out of you you're still making it about  <br>01:05:01.079 them it's still a a learning experience  <br>01:05:03.680 for them and uh you know as I would say  <br>01:05:06.680 we're building a a wall Garden of trees  <br>01:05:09.839 okay and some of those trees will bear  <br>01:05:11.079 fruit some won't they'll die in the vine  <br>01:05:13.200 others will grow roots for five years  <br>01:05:14.760 and then suddenly spring up you just  <br>01:05:16.200 never know what the the mix of trees is  <br>01:05:19.359 going to be and they all need nurturing  <br>01:05:20.720 they all need care in different ways um  <br>01:05:23.039 and it once you put those entrepreneurs  <br>01:05:25.039 at the center that process I think  <br>01:05:27.200 you're you're kind of drisking the  <br>01:05:31.400 journey I get this  <br>01:05:34.680 sense that there's something you're  <br>01:05:36.640 trying to  <br>01:05:38.760 prove to some I don't know what and but  <br>01:05:44.200 your brother keeps coming up in my mind  <br>01:05:46.520 and I don't know why yeah well I mean  <br>01:05:48.799 you we've talked about him today I think  <br>01:05:52.400 um I think uh it's it's probably fresh  <br>01:05:56.240 cuz he passed away last year um it was  <br>01:05:58.640 he was quite unwell but he had an  <br>01:06:00.680 accident before he broke 18 bones fell  <br>01:06:02.599 out of a tree and so on so I was  <br>01:06:03.960 involved in helping him in in his life  <br>01:06:05.760 and sponsoring some part of his life  <br>01:06:07.760 even though we didn't really have a  <br>01:06:08.960 connection but it was just a in my head  <br>01:06:12.440 it's not this big emotional Gap now it's  <br>01:06:15.319 just a shame it's just a bloody shame  <br>01:06:16.960 let have gone for pin or more but the  <br>01:06:18.920 fact of the matter was he'd ring me  <br>01:06:20.039 whenever he needed money or we'd have  <br>01:06:22.640 the same conversation every time you  <br>01:06:24.640 know seemed like a nice guy his friends  <br>01:06:27.400 in where he lived in Florida loved him I  <br>01:06:30.680 even met one girl who who claimed that  <br>01:06:32.400 she saved his life when she was 12 he  <br>01:06:33.960 stopped her from drowning so I'm like he  <br>01:06:36.079 seemed to have a great life there he  <br>01:06:37.640 just didn't have it with us he left when  <br>01:06:39.240 he was 19 never came back to Ireland  <br>01:06:41.440 never left America again never did email  <br>01:06:44.359 never had a smartphone he was just  <br>01:06:45.760 really removed did gardening for a  <br>01:06:48.119 living and uh I just hop that he was  <br>01:06:50.400 very very happy in that he just didn't  <br>01:06:52.440 seem to need the connections with us you  <br>01:06:54.160 know and it's just a  <br>01:06:56.359 it's it's uh there's that kind of thing  <br>01:06:59.319 of healing through understanding you  <br>01:07:00.559 sort of go okay I know what it was more  <br>01:07:02.880 importantly I understand what it wasn't  <br>01:07:04.240 and possibly some of the reasons for  <br>01:07:05.599 that it's just a Pity I think we would  <br>01:07:07.599 have had some fun together and uh I  <br>01:07:09.520 think he would have enjoyed the journey  <br>01:07:11.400 uh a little bit more you know but I  <br>01:07:13.200 think the same about my dad my dad  <br>01:07:14.520 passed away three years ago and  <br>01:07:17.960 sometimes now like I kind of you know  <br>01:07:20.039 and like yeah Dad I'm on stage in the  <br>01:07:21.720 assembly in ker getting an award for  <br>01:07:23.319 being a global person I'm a big deal in  <br>01:07:25.520 South career now and my dad would would  <br>01:07:27.520 have reveled in that you know he really  <br>01:07:29.079 did and so would my mom so uh yeah it's  <br>01:07:32.160 just about you know you look back but  <br>01:07:34.160 you don't stare is is kind of how I look  <br>01:07:36.359 at it and you you um you bring the  <br>01:07:39.319 people that you care about along in this  <br>01:07:41.000 journey and you're hopefully open and  <br>01:07:43.279 sensitive to them the language you use  <br>01:07:45.279 should be uh blending with people not  <br>01:07:48.240 conflicting with them and uh you know  <br>01:07:50.359 every day is a a learning experience  <br>01:07:52.400 with different people and and the  <br>01:07:54.799 privilege of this job is I meet so many  <br>01:07:56.880 diverse kind of people I mean  <br>01:07:59.000 even on our dni team I think there's  <br>01:08:01.240 about 24 languages on the team and I  <br>01:08:03.680 think that's a great symbol of of of  <br>01:08:05.760 success and and and I don't mean  <br>01:08:07.559 diversity for diversity's sake this  <br>01:08:09.319 isn't like quota building in in a  <br>01:08:11.599 America or something it's just like it  <br>01:08:13.680 takes a certain kind of person to leave  <br>01:08:16.000 where they lived and and they're  <br>01:08:17.560 comfortable or it's safe and their  <br>01:08:19.040 family may be there to go somewhere else  <br>01:08:21.279 to work their ass off and you know you  <br>01:08:24.279 see that in the Middle East and  <br>01:08:25.960 particularly in Dubai in in in to such  <br>01:08:28.679 an extreme that I get so excited by the  <br>01:08:31.198 people I've met and the people have  <br>01:08:32.399 hired and even I've often found recently  <br>01:08:35.439 you know there there's been some jobs we  <br>01:08:37.158 filled and I'm like oh I wish we had  <br>01:08:39.679 three slots because I I find it very  <br>01:08:41.960 hard to to pick from those three people  <br>01:08:43.520 I hate to walk away from talent but we  <br>01:08:45.920 also have we're building out an agency  <br>01:08:47.439 one of our investments and we'll have  <br>01:08:48.960 200 people there by Christmas of next  <br>01:08:50.560 year I'm like oh let's genuinely keep in  <br>01:08:53.399 touch because I'll have a thing for you  <br>01:08:55.479 just not yet or just not for this team  <br>01:08:57.238 you know um and that's great that's you  <br>01:08:59.880 know so am I trying to prove  <br>01:09:02.799 anything no I think I think one of the  <br>01:09:05.359 reasons I moved here was for a big  <br>01:09:06.880 worthy challenge I wasn't about to go  <br>01:09:08.600 into business again life was pretty  <br>01:09:10.319 comfortable and I I didn't you know I  <br>01:09:13.479 wanted a big Market with a meaningful  <br>01:09:15.560 purpose and a real a big big audacious  <br>01:09:19.080 Challenge and my God we have we got  <br>01:09:22.560 us last question before I finish sir  <br>01:09:31.600 who do you care that you want to make  <br>01:09:34.759 proud of you who do I care oh my kids  <br>01:09:39.679 definitely um you want to be uh  <br>01:09:43.120 shoulders for them you know you want  <br>01:09:44.479 have you know you want to  <br>01:09:47.279 uh you want to have gone through your  <br>01:09:49.399 struggles in a way that when they look  <br>01:09:51.560 at what you went through um they can see  <br>01:09:54.920 that the journey and you know I I often  <br>01:09:58.600 say you know my wife to my wife and I  <br>01:10:01.239 say look we've done well but the kids  <br>01:10:05.159 are broke and we want them to learn to  <br>01:10:07.159 smell blood on their own because that  <br>01:10:09.440 kind of strength and resilience is a  <br>01:10:11.080 gift you give yourself you earn it over  <br>01:10:13.000 time and I'd really want that for them  <br>01:10:16.400 um I it there's very little else  <br>01:10:18.840 important to me you know some very close  <br>01:10:21.040 friends a an interesting and momentum of  <br>01:10:24.159 life and and you know My Little Secret  <br>01:10:27.520 Garden of Love and and and kids and so  <br>01:10:29.480 on and and that's kind of it you know  <br>01:10:31.320 it's it's you know you talk about  <br>01:10:33.520 detaching from stuff earlier yeah I've  <br>01:10:36.600 been I've been at occasions where you're  <br>01:10:38.679 trying to be all things to all people  <br>01:10:40.040 particularly when you're bootstrapping a  <br>01:10:41.840 an agency in an at in Ireland you know  <br>01:10:44.199 you kind of you're you're trying to be  <br>01:10:45.960 everybody's best friend and you you  <br>01:10:47.679 become very protective of your energy  <br>01:10:49.440 because you don't have the funds to to  <br>01:10:51.960 go and build a big amazing teams like we  <br>01:10:54.000 do now and  <br>01:10:55.760 you share your energy with people  <br>01:10:58.120 because you have to bring them along  <br>01:10:59.880 with you on the  <br>01:11:01.120 journey like you're giving Junior people  <br>01:11:03.480 big titles because you can't afford the  <br>01:11:04.800 big person you're trying to bring them  <br>01:11:06.080 along and I find excuse me that my  <br>01:11:10.080 energy um there's kind of two things  <br>01:11:12.679 that that frustrate me instantly I have  <br>01:11:14.520 a slow fuse when it comes to temper but  <br>01:11:16.880 two things frustrate one is crazy  <br>01:11:18.440 drivers so you know uh  <br>01:11:22.560 Dubai pick the wrong place for that oh  <br>01:11:24.960 yeah I I sit in the back and I work and  <br>01:11:27.000 I just say let's go that way which suits  <br>01:11:29.040 me too it's it's you know but um and  <br>01:11:31.880 then simple things having to repeat  <br>01:11:34.080 myself uh like simple things that have  <br>01:11:36.560 one function they can't do it like if a  <br>01:11:38.120 toaster doesn't work you know clock the  <br>01:11:40.159 thing bread doesn't go down clock it  <br>01:11:41.600 again right goes o|## SUMMARY  <br>Colin Meagle discusses startup potential, digital transformation, and personal philosophies

What Alcohol Is Doing To Your Brain!  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/R6xbXOp7wDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch/R6xbXOp7wDA)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.240 there's a very famous experiment in  <br>00:00:02.200 which rats were engineered to have no  <br>00:00:04.200 dopamine and the scientists discovered  <br>00:00:06.160 that if they put food in the rat's mouth  <br>00:00:07.919 the rat would eat but if you put the  <br>00:00:09.280 food even a body length away the rat  <br>00:00:11.000 will starve to death which tells us that  <br>00:00:13.519 dopamine is fundamental to get the  <br>00:00:15.719 things that we need for our basic  <br>00:00:17.439 survival now every time we're doing  <br>00:00:19.640 something that's pleasurable from sugar  <br>00:00:21.439 to video games work pornography social  <br>00:00:23.599 media that will affect dopamine and the  <br>00:00:25.680 more dopamine that's released the more  <br>00:00:27.240 likely that drug or behavior is to be  <br>00:00:29.480 addictive but also the genetic risk of  <br>00:00:31.599 addiction is about 50 to 60% so if you  <br>00:00:34.200 have a biological parent or grandparent  <br>00:00:36.280 with addiction you are more likely to  <br>00:00:38.440 develop that addiction we have to keep  <br>00:00:40.399 it in balance in order to stay healthy  <br>00:00:42.600 Dr Anna lmy is Professor of Psychiatry  <br>00:00:44.600 at Stanford chief of the Stanford  <br>00:00:46.039 addiction clinic and a world leading  <br>00:00:47.719 expert on the subject of doping she will  <br>00:00:49.559 tell you how this one powerful chemical  <br>00:00:51.120 is controlling your life and what to do  <br>00:00:52.879 about it one of the most important  <br>00:00:54.399 findings in Neuroscience in the past 75  <br>00:00:56.840 years is that the same parts of the  <br>00:00:58.399 brain that process pleasure also process  <br>00:01:00.559 pain and the balance wants to remain  <br>00:01:02.920 level the problem is that we  <br>00:01:04.438 automatically seek out pleasure and  <br>00:01:06.000 avoid pain and we're exposed to all  <br>00:01:07.759 kinds of Pleasures that we have in the  <br>00:01:09.240 modern world and our brains are reeling  <br>00:01:11.119 in response to try to compensate now I  <br>00:01:13.000 need more of my drug and more potent  <br>00:01:14.479 forms to get the same effect which then  <br>00:01:16.320 leads to addiction and that's what  <br>00:01:17.720 happened to me when I got addicted to  <br>00:01:19.200 romance novels take me into that phase  <br>00:01:21.720 of your life I was out of control and I  <br>00:01:23.960 needed to restore a level balance and  <br>00:01:25.720 take the advice I give my patients and  <br>00:01:27.520 what is that

<br>00:02:14.200 minutes trying to figure out how to say  <br>00:02:15.720 this to you so I'm just going to say it  <br>00:02:17.000 how it comes out my mouth and I  <br>00:02:18.120 apologize if this is messy but if there  <br>00:02:20.280 was ever an episode this year that you  <br>00:02:22.440 should listen to it is this one I've  <br>00:02:24.840 since this episode was recorded about a  <br>00:02:26.360 month ago all I've been thinking about  <br>00:02:28.560 is how on Earth I get you to watch this  <br>00:02:30.640 and I don't say this often the last time  <br>00:02:32.160 I said this was the first time Mo gordak  <br>00:02:34.239 came on this podcast this is the second  <br>00:02:36.160 time I've said this in almost four years  <br>00:02:38.200 of recording this podcast on YouTube and  <br>00:02:40.200 the reason for that is so many of the  <br>00:02:42.560 things that I know you're struggling  <br>00:02:43.680 with in your life that stand in the way  <br>00:02:45.319 of the person you want to become that  <br>00:02:47.000 relationship you have with your phone  <br>00:02:49.319 the  <br>00:02:50.400 procrastination the cycles of behavior  <br>00:02:53.120 that make you feel embarrassed and full  <br>00:02:54.800 of shame that you've just never been  <br>00:02:56.040 able to crack all of them all of them I  <br>00:02:59.840 genuinely believe for many of you are  <br>00:03:01.159 going to be understood today if you  <br>00:03:03.120 listen to this episode it has changed my  <br>00:03:05.440 life and it has changed much of the  <br>00:03:07.360 lives of my team if if I'm wrong here  <br>00:03:11.080 you have the right to message me and  <br>00:03:12.840 tell me that I was wrong please listen  <br>00:03:15.280 to this episode really really I mean  <br>00:03:17.120 that from the bottom of my heart and  <br>00:03:18.560 just to make sure you do throughout this  <br>00:03:20.120 episode there's going to be these popups  <br>00:03:21.720 if you collect eight of these codes that  <br>00:03:23.560 are going to pop up on the screen and  <br>00:03:25.080 put them in the document link below  <br>00:03:26.959 you'll unlock something very special  <br>00:03:28.560 some additional content please listen to  <br>00:03:30.720 this  <br>00:03:34.959 episode Dr Anna  <br>00:03:37.439 lmy you wrote one of the most iconic  <br>00:03:39.959 well-known books about dopamine which  <br>00:03:43.040 propelled the subject matter of dopamine  <br>00:03:44.840 into the public  <br>00:03:45.959 Consciousness but I guess the most  <br>00:03:47.920 important question I should ask you  <br>00:03:50.360 is why does dopamine matter ah good  <br>00:03:54.680 question good good place to start I mean  <br>00:03:57.760 dopamine matters because it  <br>00:04:00.319 fundamental to our survival right so  <br>00:04:03.159 it's the chemical that we make in our  <br>00:04:04.760 brain that tells us this is something we  <br>00:04:07.400 should approach explore investigate so  <br>00:04:10.879 it's it's really almost the survival  <br>00:04:13.120 chemical so what is dopamine if you had  <br>00:04:15.360 to explain it to a 10-year-old how would  <br>00:04:17.160 you go about explaining it so dopamine  <br>00:04:19.478 is a chemical that we make in our brain  <br>00:04:23.240 um it has many different functions but  <br>00:04:27.080 one of its most important functions is  <br>00:04:29.479 that it helps us experience pleasure  <br>00:04:32.919 reward and  <br>00:04:34.800 motivation um it may be even more  <br>00:04:37.000 important for the motivation to do  <br>00:04:39.400 things than it is for the pleasure  <br>00:04:41.199 itself so for example there's a very  <br>00:04:43.840 famous experiment in which rats were  <br>00:04:46.199 engineered to have no dopamine in the  <br>00:04:49.160 brain's reward pathway and the  <br>00:04:51.360 scientists discovered that if they put  <br>00:04:53.479 food in the rat's mouth the rat would  <br>00:04:55.280 eat the food would seem to get some  <br>00:04:57.360 pleasure from the food if you can deter  <br>00:04:59.919 that from watching a rat eat which I  <br>00:05:01.919 think they felt like they could uh but  <br>00:05:04.039 if you put the food even a body length  <br>00:05:06.280 away the rat will starve to death the  <br>00:05:09.560 idea being that without dopamine we're  <br>00:05:12.479 not motivated to seek out the things  <br>00:05:15.400 that we need for our basic survival  <br>00:05:18.080 that's crazy so you get a rat you put  <br>00:05:20.440 the food an inch from its mouth and it  <br>00:05:24.039 will starve to death because it doesn't  <br>00:05:25.520 have dopamine the dopamine required to  <br>00:05:27.280 just reach out and eat yeah essentially  <br>00:05:29.800 maybe it's not an inch maybe it's a  <br>00:05:31.120 little more than an inch but the idea  <br>00:05:33.160 being that dopamine is necessary to be  <br>00:05:36.680 motivated to do the work to get the  <br>00:05:39.880 thing that we need and having an  <br>00:05:43.400 understanding of dopamine how might that  <br>00:05:45.840 improve my life having a basic  <br>00:05:48.479 understanding of how dopamine Works how  <br>00:05:51.360 we process Pleasure and Pain and also  <br>00:05:54.639 what happens with dopamine as we go from  <br>00:05:57.240 adaptive recreational use to Mal  <br>00:05:59.639 adaptive addictive use is something that  <br>00:06:02.560 is really useful especially for those of  <br>00:06:04.720 us living in the modern world where now  <br>00:06:07.240 we're exposed to so many reinforcing  <br>00:06:09.599 substances and behaviors that we've all  <br>00:06:12.000 become vulnerable to the problem of  <br>00:06:13.800 addiction and what are the biggest  <br>00:06:15.680 misconceptions of on the subject of  <br>00:06:17.479 dopamine because it's kind of thrown  <br>00:06:19.039 around in society I see it in my group  <br>00:06:20.840 chats people saying I need more dopamine  <br>00:06:22.840 or whatever or you know that person just  <br>00:06:24.960 craves dopamine what what are the  <br>00:06:26.720 biggest misconceptions you've come  <br>00:06:28.000 across the main miscon conception is  <br>00:06:30.199 that somehow we can get addicted to  <br>00:06:32.319 dopamine we're not getting addicted to  <br>00:06:34.680 dopamine itself dopamine is neither good  <br>00:06:37.240 nor bad it's a signal to tell us whether  <br>00:06:41.479 or not something that we're doing is  <br>00:06:44.120 potentially useful for our survival and  <br>00:06:47.120 also it's related to what we predicted  <br>00:06:51.360 about how rewarding or pleasurable  <br>00:06:53.759 something would be and so it's really um  <br>00:06:56.800 you know I sort of sometimes I joke it's  <br>00:06:58.360 like the um reward theory of relativity  <br>00:07:02.319 DOP mean is in the sense that Pleasure  <br>00:07:04.560 and Pain really are truly relative to  <br>00:07:07.199 one another and so dopamine gives us  <br>00:07:09.680 information about where we are in that  <br>00:07:12.280 relativity scale between Pleasure and  <br>00:07:14.360 Pain and when you say relative you mean  <br>00:07:16.440 I mean it's it's quite fitting for  <br>00:07:18.000 anyone that can't see we have a a set of  <br>00:07:19.960 scales on the table and scales are  <br>00:07:22.319 relative to each other because if you  <br>00:07:23.560 pour in one end the other end goes up  <br>00:07:26.000 and if you pour in the other end the  <br>00:07:27.000 other end goes up and this end goes down  <br>00:07:29.240 and when you say relative that's what  <br>00:07:30.800 you're describing right yes that's what  <br>00:07:32.680 that's what I'm describing yes okay and  <br>00:07:35.360 what activities that I do every day have  <br>00:07:38.160 an impact on my  <br>00:07:39.639 dopamine well probably almost everything  <br>00:07:43.479 you know in some ways um I mean every  <br>00:07:45.919 time we are doing something that's  <br>00:07:48.599 pleasurable reinforcing rewarding that  <br>00:07:52.000 will affect dope mean it's it's really  <br>00:07:54.240 the primary signal that lets us know  <br>00:07:57.080 that this thing is potentially important  <br>00:07:59.560 for our survival as I mentioned um but  <br>00:08:02.440 you know even um aversive stimuli can  <br>00:08:06.680 trigger dopamine what's oh something  <br>00:08:09.319 that's painful or not pleasurable  <br>00:08:11.159 dopamine gets involved in in that um  <br>00:08:14.159 equation anything that's novel or new is  <br>00:08:17.960 something that triggers our dopamine in  <br>00:08:20.560 in our reward pathway dopamine is  <br>00:08:23.039 fundamental for movement so not just  <br>00:08:26.120 pleasure and reward but also movement so  <br>00:08:28.800 for example Parkinson's disease which is  <br>00:08:31.560 a disease related to stiffness and  <br>00:08:34.320 Tremor is caused by a depletion of  <br>00:08:37.719 dopamine in a part of the brain called  <br>00:08:39.640 the substantia [ __ ] and as dopamine  <br>00:08:42.479 gets depleted in that part of the brain  <br>00:08:44.680 people lose the ability to move their  <br>00:08:47.240 bodies and it's probably no coincidence  <br>00:08:50.360 that the same neurotransmitter that is  <br>00:08:52.120 so important for pleasure reward  <br>00:08:54.200 motivation is also really important for  <br>00:08:56.680 movement because most organisms have to  <br>00:08:59.440 to locomote toward the object of their  <br>00:09:02.200 desire we want that thing we have to  <br>00:09:04.680 exert effort right we have to put in the  <br>00:09:06.959 work to go get it but in the world today  <br>00:09:09.680 we really don't have to do that right we  <br>00:09:11.880 can swipe right we can swipe left and  <br>00:09:13.959 all of a sudden it magically appears at  <br>00:09:16.079 the touch of a finger and that's very  <br>00:09:18.720 confusing for our brains because that's  <br>00:09:20.680 not how we evolved we really evolved for  <br>00:09:23.399 for having to do quite a bit of upfront  <br>00:09:26.240 work for a tiny little bit of reward  <br>00:09:29.920 I just want to before we move on talk  <br>00:09:32.079 about this point you said because I  <br>00:09:33.320 think it's quite foundational to  <br>00:09:34.600 everything we're going to talk about  <br>00:09:35.680 about dopamine being relative to pain  <br>00:09:38.200 and I have this set of scales in front  <br>00:09:39.839 of me and here I have some chemicals  <br>00:09:43.480 that are likely to produce dopamine in  <br>00:09:46.120 my brain I believe right so alcohol I  <br>00:09:49.040 have some rum I have some whiskey I have  <br>00:09:51.120 some vodka and can you explain to me  <br>00:09:53.839 using this rum whiskey and vodka how  <br>00:09:56.760 dopamine is relative to pain and what  <br>00:09:59.519 going on in my brain sure okay I'll  <br>00:10:01.360 slide this over to you oh  <br>00:10:03.320 okay so one of the most exciting  <br>00:10:06.839 findings in Neuroscience in the past 75  <br>00:10:09.560 years is that Pleasure and Pain are  <br>00:10:12.160 collocated in the brain so the same  <br>00:10:14.880 parts of the brain that process pleasure  <br>00:10:17.000 also process pain and in a very simple  <br>00:10:20.600 reductionist kind of way they work like  <br>00:10:23.160 opposite sides of a balance so imagine  <br>00:10:26.720 that deep in your brain's reward pathway  <br>00:10:29.040 which is is another exciting Discovery  <br>00:10:31.440 right that there's this dedicated reward  <br>00:10:33.120 pathway of the brain that consists  <br>00:10:35.279 broadly speaking of the prefrontal CeX  <br>00:10:37.680 which is this large gray matter area  <br>00:10:39.720 right behind our foreheads that's so  <br>00:10:41.399 important for future planning for  <br>00:10:43.680 delayed gratification for appreciating  <br>00:10:45.920 future consequences you might think of  <br>00:10:48.160 it as like the brakes on the car if  <br>00:10:50.200 we're going to analogize to to a to an  <br>00:10:52.839 engine and then deep you know in the  <br>00:10:55.880 brain we've got what we call the limic  <br>00:10:58.240 areas or the emotion brain and there you  <br>00:11:01.079 have the nucleus accumbens and the  <br>00:11:02.880 vental tegmental area that are rich in  <br>00:11:06.240 dopamine releasing neurons right and  <br>00:11:09.200 they act like the accelerator on the car  <br>00:11:11.639 so when you've got a healthy functioning  <br>00:11:13.760 brain you've got enough accelerator but  <br>00:11:17.240 not too much right so enough dop Meine  <br>00:11:19.200 being released but not too much and  <br>00:11:20.680 youve got a healthy prefrontal cortex  <br>00:11:23.079 putting the brakes on that dopamine  <br>00:11:25.560 release when people um become addicted  <br>00:11:29.680 there's either a problem with the brakes  <br>00:11:32.600 the prefrontal cortex or the accelerator  <br>00:11:35.120 the nucleus accumbens and vental  <br>00:11:36.600 tegmental area or both right what we're  <br>00:11:39.800 finding is that there's actually a  <br>00:11:42.720 disconnect so there are large neuronal  <br>00:11:45.160 circuits and Pathways between those deep  <br>00:11:47.440 lyic structures and the prefrontal  <br>00:11:48.920 cortex that literally get severed or  <br>00:11:51.320 disconnected when people become addicted  <br>00:11:54.560 as we think about Pleasure and Pain  <br>00:11:57.240 being collocated in the same parts of  <br>00:11:58.880 the brain working like opposite sides of  <br>00:12:00.920 the  <br>00:12:01.920 balance in order to understand what  <br>00:12:04.360 happens in the addicted brain is to  <br>00:12:06.279 appreciate that there are fundamental  <br>00:12:08.480 rules governing this balance and one of  <br>00:12:11.360 the most important rules is is that the  <br>00:12:13.279 balance wants to remain level it does  <br>00:12:15.959 not want to be tilted very long to the  <br>00:12:17.760 side of either pleasure or pain and in  <br>00:12:20.920 fact what our brain does is first tilt  <br>00:12:22.839 an equal and opposite amount to whatever  <br>00:12:25.519 the initial stimulus is so I'm going to  <br>00:12:27.519 try to illustrate that here so let's say  <br>00:12:28.959 our  <br>00:12:29.680 initial stimulus is alcohol now alcohol  <br>00:12:32.800 Works through its own chemical pathway  <br>00:12:35.079 it works on our endogenous opioid system  <br>00:12:37.440 the opioids that we make we have  <br>00:12:39.000 receptors for opioids in our brains it  <br>00:12:41.199 works on our endogenous Gaba system  <br>00:12:43.240 which is our calming  <br>00:12:44.920 neurotransmitter and at the end of the  <br>00:12:46.839 day it releases dopamine in the reward  <br>00:12:49.519 pathway so any potentially addictive  <br>00:12:52.199 substance will release dopamine in the  <br>00:12:54.399 reward pathway the more that's released  <br>00:12:57.360 and the faster that's released in a  <br>00:12:59.600 given individual the more likely that  <br>00:13:01.959 substance is to be  <br>00:13:03.519 addictive now another important concept  <br>00:13:06.240 here is what we call drug of choice  <br>00:13:08.000 which is to say what releases a lot of  <br>00:13:10.399 dopamine in your brain may not release a  <br>00:13:13.079 lot of dopamine in my brain and vice  <br>00:13:14.760 versa right which is this idea that  <br>00:13:16.800 people have predictions to different  <br>00:13:18.639 kinds of drugs and by the way people can  <br>00:13:20.600 get addicted to behaviors too I should  <br>00:13:22.680 emphasize that when you say drug of  <br>00:13:25.440 choice you mean the brain has a  <br>00:13:28.040 particular sensitivity to that drug in  <br>00:13:31.120 terms of dopamine yes okay the more  <br>00:13:34.279 dopamine that's released the faster that  <br>00:13:36.079 it's released the more likely that drug  <br>00:13:38.000 is to be addictive for a given  <br>00:13:39.639 individual so you're holding some  <br>00:13:41.079 whiskey there I'm holding some whiskey  <br>00:13:42.839 there could be a brain that is very  <br>00:13:44.600 sensitive to Whiskey and there could be  <br>00:13:46.760 a different brain that you could pull  <br>00:13:48.320 all the whiskey and you like and the  <br>00:13:49.720 dopamine response is sort of limited  <br>00:13:52.759 exactly okay and for many of my patients  <br>00:13:56.519 who become addicted to alcohol they will  <br>00:13:58.759 tell you that from the first moment they  <br>00:14:01.040 had alcohol they knew they were either  <br>00:14:03.480 in trouble or had met their best friend  <br>00:14:05.720 or some combination it was a very potent  <br>00:14:09.040 experience for them all right so let's  <br>00:14:11.680 let's go ahead and put this on the  <br>00:14:13.160 pleasure side of the  <br>00:14:14.680 balance dopamine is being released but  <br>00:14:16.920 no sooner has that happened then my  <br>00:14:19.000 brain will work very hard to restore a  <br>00:14:22.160 level balance and by the way a level  <br>00:14:24.160 balance is what neuroscientists call  <br>00:14:26.720 homeostasis okay and one of the  <br>00:14:29.120 overarching physiologic drives for all  <br>00:14:31.160 living organisms is to return to  <br>00:14:32.959 homeostasis homeostasis is that  <br>00:14:35.360 parameter of what's often called called  <br>00:14:38.440 affordances or states of being that are  <br>00:14:41.600 adaptive and healthy for the organism  <br>00:14:43.839 for example like we have a certain  <br>00:14:45.920 homeostasis of body temperature and if  <br>00:14:47.920 we go much too much beyond that either  <br>00:14:50.959 too high or too low we will disintegrate  <br>00:14:53.120 and die right so homeostasis is that  <br>00:14:55.639 that states of being that are compatible  <br>00:14:58.480 with existence  <br>00:14:59.720 and and potentially advantageous too  <br>00:15:01.560 sort of Baseline level that's right yeah  <br>00:15:04.079 Baseline level and by the way we're  <br>00:15:05.360 always releasing dopamine at a kind of  <br>00:15:07.040 tonic Baseline level in our brains I  <br>00:15:08.880 sometimes think of it as the heartbeat  <br>00:15:10.040 of the brain so what's happened here for  <br>00:15:11.920 people that can't see is you've poured a  <br>00:15:13.199 little bit of whiskey into one end of  <br>00:15:14.519 the scale the pleasure side of the scale  <br>00:15:17.040 and the other side of the scale has  <br>00:15:18.680 risen because now there's whiskey um in  <br>00:15:21.120 the the pleasure side which I guess is  <br>00:15:22.720 released dopamine exactly so now now we'  <br>00:15:25.519 released dopamine in the reward pathway  <br>00:15:27.880 okay because the pain side went up does  <br>00:15:29.920 that mean there's now less pain in the  <br>00:15:31.480 brain well I think you know again this  <br>00:15:34.040 is a metaphor it's an oversimplification  <br>00:15:36.560 the idea here is just when we press on  <br>00:15:38.920 the pleasure side we're releasing  <br>00:15:40.839 dopamine in the reward pathway and  <br>00:15:42.279 experiencing pleasure okay okay but no  <br>00:15:45.240 sooner has that happened then our brain  <br>00:15:47.199 will try to compensate or adapt to  <br>00:15:50.600 increased dopamine firing by down  <br>00:15:52.959 regulating dopamine transmission for  <br>00:15:54.880 example by involuting post synaptic  <br>00:15:57.560 dopamine receptors that mean okay okay  <br>00:16:00.759 so our brain is a bunch of wires you  <br>00:16:04.240 know um that conduct these electrical  <br>00:16:06.639 signals and and these long spindly cells  <br>00:16:09.120 are called neurons and the thing about  <br>00:16:11.199 neurons is that they don't actually  <br>00:16:13.120 touch end to end there's a little Gap or  <br>00:16:15.519 space between them and that Gap is  <br>00:16:17.000 called the synapse and that Gap or  <br>00:16:20.199 synapse is bridged by what we call  <br>00:16:21.880 neurotransmitters and dopamine is one of  <br>00:16:23.800 those neurotransmitters okay and when  <br>00:16:27.120 the pre synaptic neuron pulses and  <br>00:16:29.759 releases dopamine it crosses the synapse  <br>00:16:32.759 and binds to a receptor on the post  <br>00:16:35.360 synaptic neuron which either continues  <br>00:16:38.000 or aborts that electrical signal does  <br>00:16:40.160 that make sense yes okay so one of the  <br>00:16:42.920 ways that our brain can decrease the  <br>00:16:46.040 effects of dopamine decrease dopamine  <br>00:16:48.160 transmission is by involuting or taking  <br>00:16:51.480 inside the neuron the post synaptic  <br>00:16:54.399 receptor that way when dopamine is  <br>00:16:56.360 released it has nowhere to bind oh okay  <br>00:16:58.480 so it's like removing the docking  <br>00:17:00.079 station exactly very good it's removing  <br>00:17:02.800 the docking station so essentially  <br>00:17:04.480 getting back to our scale we've we've  <br>00:17:06.480 you know ingested alcohol we've  <br>00:17:08.199 increased dopamine firing in the reward  <br>00:17:10.280 pathway but remember our pleasure pain  <br>00:17:12.319 balance wants to return to the level  <br>00:17:14.400 position level with the ground  <br>00:17:16.679 homeostasis so it's going to decrease  <br>00:17:19.160 dopamine transmission by for example  <br>00:17:21.520 involuting those post synaptic dopamine  <br>00:17:24.319 receptors but one thing about the brain  <br>00:17:27.079 in its process of trying to get back to  <br>00:17:29.799 homeostasis and again I like to think of  <br>00:17:31.760 this neuro adaptation process as these  <br>00:17:33.760 Gremlins hopping on the pain side of the  <br>00:17:36.400 balance to bring it level again you  <br>00:17:38.039 don't have Gremlins here you have these  <br>00:17:39.360 little rocks but let's go ahead and put  <br>00:17:41.480 a rock on the pain side of the balance  <br>00:17:43.240 and the these rocks are are friends  <br>00:17:45.880 right their job is to level the balance  <br>00:17:47.880 because remember we got to go back to  <br>00:17:48.799 homeostasis I'm going to put a rock on  <br>00:17:50.600 and you're going to see oh my gosh it  <br>00:17:53.000 overshot right it now I've got it  <br>00:17:55.880 pressed down on the the pain side of the  <br>00:17:57.840 balance but that's exactly what happens  <br>00:18:00.480 in our brains in this process of neuro  <br>00:18:02.559 adaptation those Gremlins hopping on the  <br>00:18:04.960 pain side of the balance don't get off  <br>00:18:07.120 as soon as the balance is level they  <br>00:18:08.720 stay on until we're tilted and equal an  <br>00:18:11.360 opposite amount so is that what a  <br>00:18:13.080 hangover is or a cown as they would say  <br>00:18:16.360 when people take drugs they say I have a  <br>00:18:18.120 come down exactly that's exactly what it  <br>00:18:21.520 is that's the hangover the come down the  <br>00:18:23.760 Blue Monday or on a much smaller scale  <br>00:18:26.799 just that moment of craving right that  <br>00:18:29.080 moment of wanting to have one more shot  <br>00:18:31.960 right why does it overshoot why can't it  <br>00:18:33.720 just perfectly hit homeostasis such a  <br>00:18:36.360 great question because then we'd feel  <br>00:18:38.159 fine yeah why did Mother Nature do that  <br>00:18:40.400 to us so cruel right yeah okay I'm going  <br>00:18:45.640 to tell you an evolutionary just so  <br>00:18:47.480 story what we mean by that is we don't  <br>00:18:49.320 really know why you know this mechanism  <br>00:18:51.880 exists but from an evolutionary  <br>00:18:54.520 perspective if you're living in a world  <br>00:18:56.720 of scarcity and everpresent danger this  <br>00:19:00.039 is the perfect mechanism to make sure  <br>00:19:03.200 that we're never satisfied with what we  <br>00:19:05.520 have that we're always wanting more it's  <br>00:19:08.640 made us the ultimate  <br>00:19:10.480 Seekers okay because immediately after  <br>00:19:12.880 getting something I'm now feeling a lack  <br>00:19:15.720 of pleasure and I'm at a deficit you  <br>00:19:17.960 know on the pain side of the scale which  <br>00:19:19.760 means that I'm going to go seeking out  <br>00:19:21.400 more dopamine and in a world where  <br>00:19:23.960 everything is quite scarce that could  <br>00:19:25.799 mean going on another 4-Hour hunt the  <br>00:19:27.960 next day to go killer gazelle or  <br>00:19:29.480 something perfect you got yeah you got  <br>00:19:31.960 it interesting yeah okay so that's going  <br>00:19:34.960 to motivate me because this get so Jesus  <br>00:19:39.000 people that have hangovers don't seem  <br>00:19:40.320 very  <br>00:19:41.440 motivated right so now that's a so why  <br>00:19:44.240 is that right it's because alcohol is a  <br>00:19:49.600 product of human  <br>00:19:51.960 engineering that releases so much  <br>00:19:54.640 dopamine all at once in the reward  <br>00:19:56.880 pathway that our brains are reeling to  <br>00:20:00.240 compensate right we we really weren't  <br>00:20:03.080 evolved for this much pleasure with this  <br>00:20:06.720 much easy access as you said yourself we  <br>00:20:09.240 were really evolved for to have to do  <br>00:20:12.200 quite a lot of work upfront and to be  <br>00:20:15.039 hungry and to be lonely and to be tired  <br>00:20:17.600 and then get a little bit of reward that  <br>00:20:20.039 would then bring us back up to  <br>00:20:22.440 homostasis so really we were evolved to  <br>00:20:25.159 be pressing on the pain side of the  <br>00:20:26.760 balance in our effort to find pleasure  <br>00:20:29.440 and then when we find it that little bit  <br>00:20:31.720 of food or clothing or shelter or a mate  <br>00:20:34.320 would bring us back to the level  <br>00:20:35.840 position does that makes sense yeah so  <br>00:20:37.520 you're you're telling me essentially  <br>00:20:38.679 that we're all wired to be addicted  <br>00:20:42.679 because if this is how our brain works  <br>00:20:44.400 in a world it's designed to seek out  <br>00:20:48.039 more dopamine but the problem we have  <br>00:20:50.000 now is we have all the synthetic  <br>00:20:51.600 dopamine effectively like this so  <br>00:20:53.840 synthetic chemicals and synthetic things  <br>00:20:55.880 and you know an Internet that is wiring  <br>00:20:58.679 us to give us so much dopamine so easily  <br>00:21:01.640 that that means that our brains are  <br>00:21:02.760 effectively like mismatched to the world  <br>00:21:05.320 that we live in and therefore wired to  <br>00:21:06.760 be addicted yeah I think you actually  <br>00:21:08.039 said that I found a quote you said in an  <br>00:21:10.440 interview where you said we all wired to  <br>00:21:12.880 be addicted and if you're not addicted  <br>00:21:14.440 yet it's right around the corner right  <br>00:21:17.120 coming to a website near you yes I I  <br>00:21:19.760 guess I would I would qualify that a  <br>00:21:21.840 little bit by saying we're wired for  <br>00:21:24.480 survival in a world of scarcity that's  <br>00:21:27.919 not the world live in now we live in a  <br>00:21:29.679 world of overwhelming overabundance and  <br>00:21:32.320 so there is a mismatch between this  <br>00:21:34.480 ancient wiring that has us relentlessly  <br>00:21:36.679 pursuing pleasure in order to survive  <br>00:21:40.279 and a world that's so infused with  <br>00:21:42.600 pleasure and so many rewarding stimuli  <br>00:21:44.960 that now we're overwhelming our reward  <br>00:21:47.120 system and our brains are reeling in  <br>00:21:49.360 response to try to compensate so what  <br>00:21:51.679 happens to this scale then in such a  <br>00:21:53.559 world where I can get a big hit of  <br>00:21:55.320 dopamine all the time using some of  <br>00:21:57.600 these synthetic things or the internet  <br>00:21:59.279 or pornography or whatever else what's  <br>00:22:01.120 going on with this scale over and over  <br>00:22:02.679 again okay great so let me get there let  <br>00:22:04.960 me first say though that remember after  <br>00:22:07.559 we do something that's highly  <br>00:22:09.279 pleasurable our brain compensates with  <br>00:22:11.480 neuro adaptation tilting an equal and  <br>00:22:13.720 opposite amount to the side of pain and  <br>00:22:16.480 then restoring our balance back to the  <br>00:22:19.440 level position right or what we call  <br>00:22:21.400 homeostasis so this doesn't last forever  <br>00:22:23.919 right it's to pleasure then it's to pain  <br>00:22:26.240 then it's back to the level position but  <br>00:22:28.720 if we continue to consume our drug of  <br>00:22:31.240 choice over days to weeks to months to  <br>00:22:34.120 years and we add in a whole bunch of  <br>00:22:36.760 other drugs and now we're consuming you  <br>00:22:40.039 know pornography and smoking pot and  <br>00:22:43.120 eating um donuts and you know you name  <br>00:22:47.520 it all at the same time then essentially  <br>00:22:50.559 what happens is those Gremlins on the  <br>00:22:53.559 pain side of the balance end up camped  <br>00:22:56.480 out there for anyone that see she put  <br>00:22:59.120 all of the Rocks into the pain side to  <br>00:23:01.279 represent All Of The Addictive behaviors  <br>00:23:03.279 that this individual has now taken on  <br>00:23:06.320 right and now we've entered addicted  <br>00:23:10.039 brain by which I mean that we've changed  <br>00:23:12.919 our honic or Joy set point to the side  <br>00:23:17.440 of pain now we need more and more of our  <br>00:23:21.240 drug in more potent forms not to get  <br>00:23:24.520 high and feel good but just to level the  <br>00:23:28.000 balance feel normal and this is not  <br>00:23:29.720 going to be enough to level the balance  <br>00:23:31.720 I would have to like keep filling this  <br>00:23:34.200 much more than this container can hold  <br>00:23:36.600 and that would be in Pursuit really of  <br>00:23:38.480 just trying to level that balance so  <br>00:23:40.720 that we can feel normal and when we're  <br>00:23:42.200 not using we're walking around with a  <br>00:23:44.559 balance tilted toward the side of pain  <br>00:23:47.120 experiencing the universal symptoms of  <br>00:23:49.520 withdrawal from any addictive substance  <br>00:23:52.159 or behavior which are anxiety  <br>00:23:55.080 irritability insomnia depression and  <br>00:23:58.120 crav  <br>00:23:59.360 so if I managed to get enough vodka  <br>00:24:01.799 whiskey rum and pour it into the  <br>00:24:03.840 pleasure side of the scale now that all  <br>00:24:05.360 the rocks are in the pain side of the  <br>00:24:06.720 scale I managed to outweigh  <br>00:24:09.120 it it would it would what would then  <br>00:24:11.960 happen more rocks more rocks would be  <br>00:24:14.240 added yes more so momentarily yeah I  <br>00:24:17.640 would maybe be in a little bit of  <br>00:24:19.279 pleasure yes but then my brain would  <br>00:24:21.000 remove those docking stations again  <br>00:24:22.679 remove more of them and more rocks would  <br>00:24:24.360 go in and I'd slam  <br>00:24:26.000 down on the pain side again which means  <br>00:24:28.399 I need more alcohol to try and get up to  <br>00:24:30.799 pleasure SL okay so really you want to  <br>00:24:33.679 you want to like dopamine fast you need  <br>00:24:37.440 you need to just balance this and this  <br>00:24:39.080 is so difficult because of the world we  <br>00:24:40.480 live in it's almost it's it's it's funny  <br>00:24:42.880 enough because this little scales  <br>00:24:44.559 experiment um analogy here has given me  <br>00:24:46.960 a huge amount of empathy for people that  <br>00:24:48.159 are addicts oh gosh I'm so glad you said  <br>00:24:50.520 that because I think that is the key to  <br>00:24:53.799 empathy for the disease of addiction as  <br>00:24:56.520 well as for people with the disease  <br>00:24:57.919 having empathy for themselves is  <br>00:25:00.399 recognizing that on some level it it's  <br>00:25:04.799 it's out of their control right because  <br>00:25:07.120 when we are tilted to the side of pain  <br>00:25:09.559 the overwhelming drive to restore a  <br>00:25:12.559 level balance or restore homeostasis as  <br>00:25:14.840 quickly as possible overwhelms any other  <br>00:25:18.000 rational thought about the consequences  <br>00:25:20.320 of my drug use right it's just like get  <br>00:25:22.799 back to the level position because if I  <br>00:25:25.240 do that I'll at least feel temporarily  <br>00:25:27.559 better  <br>00:25:29.399 one of the things this analogy also  <br>00:25:31.520 highlights for me is that people who are  <br>00:25:34.399 addicted aren't trying to self harm  <br>00:25:37.720 right and this is kind of the prevailing  <br>00:25:39.679 narrative that if you're like why would  <br>00:25:41.880 you do that to yourself right whereas  <br>00:25:43.720 when I look at this analogy I go  <br>00:25:45.480 actually what they're trying to do is  <br>00:25:47.840 to deal with pain and we're all trying  <br>00:25:50.440 to find ways to deal with our pain and  <br>00:25:53.240 but in this analogy what ultimately  <br>00:25:54.799 happens and I guess is what's happening  <br>00:25:56.240 with addicts is the way they're choosing  <br>00:25:58.000 to deal with their pain is becoming  <br>00:26:00.399 self-destructive and that's creating  <br>00:26:01.919 more pain right and it's this vicious  <br>00:26:04.080 downward cycle yes and I think that sort  <br>00:26:05.960 of reframing of what's going on there is  <br>00:26:07.600 really critical because again it begets  <br>00:26:09.159 more empathy absolutely I agree with you  <br>00:26:12.559 and and I think you know we this this  <br>00:26:15.480 metaphor it makes an assumption that we  <br>00:26:18.480 all start with a pleasure pain balance  <br>00:26:20.000 that's level with the ground but  <br>00:26:21.440 actually that's probably not true right  <br>00:26:24.399 some people at Baseline may actually be  <br>00:26:26.919 more depressed or more anxious or may  <br>00:26:29.080 have had life experiences that sets them  <br>00:26:31.360 up for a kind of chronic stress reaction  <br>00:26:34.760 and we know that people with  <br>00:26:35.919 co-occurring psychiatric disorders for  <br>00:26:37.799 example are at increased risk of  <br>00:26:39.799 developing addiction probably because  <br>00:26:41.559 they're reaching for that substance to  <br>00:26:43.960 self medicate their psychiatric problem  <br>00:26:47.600 the the issue with that is that it's not  <br>00:26:50.320 medicinal right it's not healing  <br>00:26:53.159 although in the short term substances  <br>00:26:56.159 can help with those kinds of feelings  <br>00:26:58.240 feelings of psychological and physical  <br>00:27:00.720 pain over time because of the way the  <br>00:27:03.760 brain adapts as we've  <br>00:27:06.320 discussed substances and other addictive  <br>00:27:09.200 behaviors just make psychiatric problems  <br>00:27:11.600 worse right as we drive ourselves  <br>00:27:13.880 further into the the kind of uh you know  <br>00:27:16.679 the pain side of the balance so is this  <br>00:27:18.520 why trauma often leads to addictive  <br>00:27:20.440 behaviors because the trauma has caused  <br>00:27:23.200 a a pain a stress and we're searching  <br>00:27:26.720 for ways to  <br>00:27:29.200 medicate that pain or stress yeah to  <br>00:27:31.279 numb ourselves to not be present in our  <br>00:27:33.640 reality and have to deal with what's  <br>00:27:35.559 going on there is dopamine what role is  <br>00:27:37.880 dopamine playing in it's all the same  <br>00:27:39.760 dopamine  <br>00:27:41.039 originally was to help us find those  <br>00:27:43.519 things that we need to survive food  <br>00:27:46.039 clothing shelter a mate we call those  <br>00:27:48.559 Natural Rewards but  <br>00:27:51.760 today that same reward pathway that  <br>00:27:54.720 relies on dopamine has been hijacked by  <br>00:27:57.440 all of these  <br>00:27:58.640 artificial rewards that our brain  <br>00:28:01.600 confuses as necessary for survival which  <br>00:28:05.080 is why people with severe addiction will  <br>00:28:07.840 be willing to lose you know not  <br>00:28:10.159 consciously but unconsciously their  <br>00:28:12.840 loved ones their homes their jobs  <br>00:28:15.480 everything they have in pursuit of their  <br>00:28:17.159 drug of choice it's because their brain  <br>00:28:19.399 has been hijacked and they now confuse  <br>00:28:23.080 the drug as necessary for survival the  <br>00:28:26.240 other thing about drugs is that they're  <br>00:28:28.399 incredibly potent they release a lot of  <br>00:28:30.440 dopamine all at once which again is  <br>00:28:32.919 confusing for our brain Natural Rewards  <br>00:28:36.519 require upfront effort where we do a lot  <br>00:28:38.720 of work and then we get a little bit of  <br>00:28:41.399 dopamine and that's what our brains  <br>00:28:43.200 evolved for I mean I can that makes  <br>00:28:45.399 sense in my own life when I'm most  <br>00:28:47.919 stressed or most challenged by something  <br>00:28:50.679 professionally is when I I immediately  <br>00:28:52.880 notice that my diet goes out the window  <br>00:28:54.840 I start eating things that are bad I  <br>00:28:56.279 actually stop going to the gym as much  <br>00:28:58.640 um and it's it be can form a bit of a  <br>00:29:01.320 downward spiral can't it I guess as  <br>00:29:03.080 we've kind of seen from the dopamine  <br>00:29:04.679 scale um can I can I get back to that  <br>00:29:07.760 your question though about trauma and  <br>00:29:09.440 stress so um there's a very series  <br>00:29:13.279 there's a very interesting series of  <br>00:29:14.840 experiments in rodents mice and rats  <br>00:29:18.960 where they first of all rodents very  <br>00:29:22.760 easily get addicted to cocaine they will  <br>00:29:25.279 press a lever for cocaine until  <br>00:29:27.440 exhaustion or death but if that cocaine  <br>00:29:31.039 is then taken away that behavior will  <br>00:29:34.720 extinguish which means that the mice  <br>00:29:37.200 will eventually just stop pressing the  <br>00:29:38.840 lever right because they're not getting  <br>00:29:40.120 any cocaine totally makes sense and then  <br>00:29:42.240 they'll go off and do something else in  <br>00:29:43.640 the cage but if they're then exposed to  <br>00:29:46.919 a very painful foot shock right so a  <br>00:29:50.159 very extreme physical pain which you  <br>00:29:52.159 could equate to a serious life stressor  <br>00:29:55.559 the first thing the rat will do is run  <br>00:29:58.320 over to the lever and start pressing for  <br>00:30:02.919 cocaine which tells us that once our  <br>00:30:06.120 brain has discovered a drug that  <br>00:30:08.679 releases a lot of dopamine in our reward  <br>00:30:12.279 pathway even after we stop using that  <br>00:30:15.480 drug if we are exposed to an extreme  <br>00:30:20.360 stressor our brain will tell us  <br>00:30:23.080 immediately go and do that thing that  <br>00:30:25.799 gives us a lot of dopamine because you  <br>00:30:28.000 are under stress and I need to be  <br>00:30:30.279 relieved of stress does that make sense  <br>00:30:32.080 makes perfect sense yeah so if you  <br>00:30:33.799 especially so if you discover your drug  <br>00:30:35.159 of choice when you're younger and it's  <br>00:30:36.799 food or it's pornography or if it's I  <br>00:30:39.840 don't know anything that really made you  <br>00:30:41.679 feel good for a moment a moment of  <br>00:30:43.640 pleasure that will always become in the  <br>00:30:46.519 case of these rodent  <br>00:30:48.960 experiments the thing you run back to  <br>00:30:51.519 when life gets hard right and we see  <br>00:30:54.039 that again and again in people in  <br>00:30:56.159 sustained recovery from addtion that  <br>00:30:59.600 when they are under stress that is a  <br>00:31:03.639 trigger potentially for them to relapse  <br>00:31:06.200 so they have to be really thoughtful in  <br>00:31:08.000 their lives for number one trying to  <br>00:31:10.039 avoid stressful situations and and by  <br>00:31:12.559 the way stress can come in many  <br>00:31:14.639 different forms there's a great acronym  <br>00:31:16.240 in in alcoholic synonymous called halt  <br>00:31:19.039 hungry angry lonely tired those kinds of  <br>00:31:23.880 stressors everyday stressors which we  <br>00:31:26.279 all experience hungry angry lonely tired  <br>00:31:29.480 can trigger us to want to use so people  <br>00:31:31.960 in recovery have to be really thoughtful  <br>00:31:33.760 about not getting too hungry not getting  <br>00:31:35.880 too angry not getting too lonely and not  <br>00:31:38.600 getting too tired at the end of this  <br>00:31:40.440 conversation I want to go through all of  <br>00:31:41.519 the sort of practical solutions that  <br>00:31:43.360 someone struggling with an addiction to  <br>00:31:44.760 social media pornography food whatever  <br>00:31:47.880 it might be um Can Implement to try and  <br>00:31:50.960 shift that cycle that they might be  <br>00:31:53.159 going through especially when they're  <br>00:31:54.519 halting hungry angry lonely or tired how  <br>00:31:57.399 often have you worked with addicts have  <br>00:31:59.320 you spent much time working with addicts  <br>00:32:00.840 directly oh my gosh yeah so that's the  <br>00:32:02.720 bulk of my career is working uh with  <br>00:32:05.679 people with all different kinds of  <br>00:32:07.000 addictions me an example of the most  <br>00:32:09.039 obscure the most I had a patient who was  <br>00:32:11.840 addicted to  <br>00:32:13.399 water I know hard hard to imagine you  <br>00:32:16.639 have to though understand her narrative  <br>00:32:19.480 so she had a very severe alcohol  <br>00:32:21.880 addiction she got into recovery from  <br>00:32:24.320 that addiction and gave up alcohol but  <br>00:32:26.919 she discovered that by drinking copious  <br>00:32:29.880 amounts of water she could become  <br>00:32:32.880 hyponic meaning that she could lower the  <br>00:32:36.360 sodium levels in her bloodstream which  <br>00:32:38.159 would then lead her to become delirious  <br>00:32:40.600 and so in her desire to just be checked  <br>00:32:42.720 out she would do that she would she  <br>00:32:45.080 would drink a large amounts of water  <br>00:32:48.240 she's doing okay no sadly she's not um  <br>00:32:51.600 she she ended up taking her own life so  <br>00:32:54.240 that was very sad  <br>00:32:59.720 gosh in that situation was there was  <br>00:33:02.760 there a root cause of that behavior  <br>00:33:04.440 pattern further Upstream some kind of  <br>00:33:06.639 trauma or experience that had set this  <br>00:33:09.120 sort of cascade cascading set of issues  <br>00:33:11.240 off yeah you know I'm just speaking  <br>00:33:14.039 broadly um for for some patients with  <br>00:33:17.120 severe addiction trauma is a huge Factor  <br>00:33:21.480 um especially severe Early Childhood  <br>00:33:24.000 trauma but there are also many folks we  <br>00:33:27.399 see  <br>00:33:28.399 who have kind of great parents and have  <br>00:33:31.159 had happy childhoods and have great  <br>00:33:34.159 social networks and and work that they  <br>00:33:36.720 enjoy and yet they still become addicted  <br>00:33:40.240 and that's because we again we are wired  <br>00:33:44.600 to consume as much as possible of  <br>00:33:47.880 whatever releases dopamine in our brains  <br>00:33:50.120 to have survived Evolution to this date  <br>00:33:53.519 and yet we're living in this world where  <br>00:33:55.320 we have access to so many drug aied  <br>00:33:58.519 substances and behaviors that we've all  <br>00:34:00.760 become vulnerable to this problem and  <br>00:34:02.960 the reason I highlight this is because  <br>00:34:05.360 one of the things that I think has  <br>00:34:06.760 happened in the field of addiction  <br>00:34:08.359 medicine that maybe isn't the best is  <br>00:34:12.320 that often times patients themselves as  <br>00:34:14.879 well as their providers are digging  <br>00:34:17.040 really deep to find the trauma or the  <br>00:34:20.639 reason that someone has become addicted  <br>00:34:23.760 and I think that that's important to do  <br>00:34:25.800 in some cases but in in other other  <br>00:34:28.079 cases it can lead to kind of  <br>00:34:30.239 manufacturing trauma where there really  <br>00:34:32.280 isn't any furthermore I would say that  <br>00:34:35.199 when a person is in the throws of their  <br>00:34:37.119 addiction they're not going to be able  <br>00:34:39.560 to really do the complex emotional  <br>00:34:42.199 processing of their trauma while they're  <br>00:34:44.520 still using their drug of choice that  <br>00:34:46.719 they really need to get out of that  <br>00:34:48.440 Vortex of addiction and get into some  <br>00:34:50.560 degree of recovery before you would even  <br>00:34:53.159 want to go tackle some of those early  <br>00:34:55.560 traumatic experiences how many people do  <br>00:34:58.240 you think are struggling with some form  <br>00:34:59.680 of  <br>00:35:00.640 addiction well if you think of addiction  <br>00:35:02.920 as a spectrum disorder right there's  <br>00:35:04.800 mild moderate and severe um and there's  <br>00:35:08.200 I would even say a kind of a pre-  <br>00:35:09.680 addiction state where we're all sort of  <br>00:35:11.359 dabbling in compulsive overc consumption  <br>00:35:14.079 I would say the vast majority of us like  <br>00:35:16.760 90 probably  <br>00:35:19.200 95% have some degree of compulsive over  <br>00:35:22.599 consumption and you know if and when it  <br>00:35:25.320 tips over into what we would call  <br>00:35:26.920 addiction there's not a brain scan or a  <br>00:35:29.160 blood test to assess that it's not like  <br>00:35:31.040 you know switching a light a light  <br>00:35:32.520 switch and it's like oh yeah now you  <br>00:35:33.680 have addiction um it's not like that  <br>00:35:36.200 it's you know it's a gradual often a  <br>00:35:37.920 gradual and Insidious thing and we don't  <br>00:35:40.280 in fact have a biological measurement of  <br>00:35:42.960 addiction we Bas it on what we call  <br>00:35:45.320 phenomenology which is patterns of  <br>00:35:47.200 behavior that re repeat themselves  <br>00:35:49.079 across time and broadly speaking the  <br>00:35:52.319 definition of addiction is the continued  <br>00:35:54.440 compulsive use of a substance or a  <br>00:35:57.079 behavior despite harm to self and or  <br>00:36:00.280 others and so you know that harm can be  <br>00:36:03.800 very subtle um or not right and it can  <br>00:36:07.560 be a judgment call interesting because  <br>00:36:10.839 we do throw the word Addiction around a  <br>00:36:12.400 lot in society but but really the most  <br>00:36:15.280 important part of that is to understand  <br>00:36:17.040 if it's harming yourself or someone else  <br>00:36:18.920 the behavior pattern yes that's right  <br>00:36:20.800 and to also recognize that we're not  <br>00:36:22.440 very good judges of that when we're  <br>00:36:24.160 chasing dopamine okay so we sometimes  <br>00:36:26.720 justify behaviors we have as being not  <br>00:36:29.119 harmful and it's fine and it's not  <br>00:36:30.480 impacting me at all and what do you mean  <br>00:36:32.240 exactly and we don't we're not very good  <br>00:36:34.079 at seeing true cause and effect honestly  <br>00:36:36.200 when it comes to these behaviors which  <br>00:36:38.240 is why often times people won't really  <br>00:36:40.319 see the harm until they've stopped using  <br>00:36:43.000 for a period of time in your book  <br>00:36:45.480 dopamine Nation you talk about an  <br>00:36:47.160 addiction that you had yes and it was  <br>00:36:49.160 really surprising to me because I would  <br>00:36:51.880 never have thought that being obsessed  <br>00:36:53.359 with erotic  <br>00:36:54.839 novels could be classified as an  <br>00:36:57.040 addiction  <br>00:36:59.839 what happened what was the behavior take  <br>00:37:01.440 me into that that phase of your life so  <br>00:37:04.400 I was in my early 40s um my kids were no  <br>00:37:08.200 longer little um I got a lot of my  <br>00:37:10.760 self-worth and identity from being a mom  <br>00:37:14.079 and my kids were sort of entering  <br>00:37:15.839 adolescence they were doing fine but  <br>00:37:18.160 they didn't need me as much um so I had  <br>00:37:20.880 kind of a grief reaction you know in  <br>00:37:22.560 response to that was trying to figure  <br>00:37:24.480 out you know how to navigate this next  <br>00:37:26.280 phase of my life I'd always been a  <br>00:37:28.640 reader and in particular a reader of  <br>00:37:30.640 novels um in my own way that was how as  <br>00:37:33.880 a child I self soothed was to escape  <br>00:37:36.240 into uh the Fantasy Life of novels um  <br>00:37:39.720 but I never had what what I would call a  <br>00:37:42.040 problem with it and then one day I heard  <br>00:37:44.880 another mother at school said that she  <br>00:37:46.640 was reading this great book it was  <br>00:37:48.160 called Twilight it was about these  <br>00:37:50.040 vampires and she was going on and on  <br>00:37:52.000 about it and I read it and I I can't  <br>00:37:53.960 tell you what it was but it was just  <br>00:37:55.400 like the the the key in my particular it  <br>00:37:57.880 was completely  <br>00:37:59.079 transporting it just released a lot of  <br>00:38:01.880 dope mean is all I can imagine in my  <br>00:38:03.720 brains reward pathway and so I read the  <br>00:38:06.119 whole series and then I read the series  <br>00:38:08.200 again and I read it again and of course  <br>00:38:10.440 by the third or fourth time it wasn't as  <br>00:38:13.000 you know reinforcing and I thought to  <br>00:38:14.839 myself I wonder if there are any more  <br>00:38:17.200 vampire romance novels and then for me  <br>00:38:20.240 the real Tipping Point was I got an  <br>00:38:22.079 e-reader I got a Kindle because what  <br>00:38:24.960 happened was I I even before I got the  <br>00:38:27.680 Kindle I started reading you know novels  <br>00:38:30.319 that I would say I would be slightly  <br>00:38:31.440 embarrassed to admit that I was reading  <br>00:38:33.640 like kind of bodice Ripper novels as  <br>00:38:36.280 time went on I I needed more and more  <br>00:38:39.319 like graphic kinds of descriptions in  <br>00:38:42.680 order to find it pleasurable and and by  <br>00:38:45.440 the way that's classic for the addiction  <br>00:38:48.880 narrative right where you start out with  <br>00:38:50.960 a little bit and it goes a long way and  <br>00:38:52.599 then over time you build up tolerance  <br>00:38:54.599 that's neuro adaptation the Gremlins  <br>00:38:57.560 pressing down on the pain side of  <br>00:38:58.720 balance now I need more of my drug in  <br>00:39:00.200 more potent forms to get the same effect  <br>00:39:02.760 gradually over time I started um reading  <br>00:39:06.280 you know more and more sort of graphic  <br>00:39:09.079 erotic sexualized versions of this novel  <br>00:39:12.560 and I would I was embarrassed so I would  <br>00:39:14.520 hide that I was reading them and that  <br>00:39:16.119 gets into the whole double life of  <br>00:39:17.640 addiction where now we're lying about  <br>00:39:19.720 our use we're we're using our drug over  <br>00:39:21.960 here but pretending like we're not so my  <br>00:39:24.319 kids or my husband would walk in the  <br>00:39:25.520 room and I would be you know hiding  <br>00:39:27.760 behind another book one book behind  <br>00:39:30.079 another book so it looked like I was  <br>00:39:32.319 reading something you know I don't know  <br>00:39:34.520 more  <br>00:39:36.720 sophisticated and then the Tipping Point  <br>00:39:38.800 for me came really when I got a Kindle  <br>00:39:40.920 or an e-reader and then my reading was  <br>00:39:43.560 totally Anonymous I could read these  <br>00:39:45.280 books anywhere any time no one knew what  <br>00:39:47.359 I was reading and as soon as I finished  <br>00:39:49.760 one um I could read another one and I  <br>00:39:53.359 almost overnight became a chain reader  <br>00:39:55.640 like literally when I was n doing  <br>00:39:58.160 something else that I had to do I was  <br>00:40:00.560 reading romance novels one after another  <br>00:40:03.160 after another um which meant I was you  <br>00:40:06.000 know less present for my kids less  <br>00:40:08.079 present for my husband I would often  <br>00:40:10.119 stay up till 2: 3 4 in the morning on a  <br>00:40:12.560 week night reading romance novels have  <br>00:40:15.040 to get up two hours later go to work  <br>00:40:17.400 exhausted not able to be present for my  <br>00:40:19.640 patience not enjoying my work gradually  <br>00:40:22.200 getting more depressed more irritable  <br>00:40:24.040 more anxious more insomnia we went on on  <br>00:40:27.520 a a family vacation with an family  <br>00:40:29.960 friends of ours everybody together at  <br>00:40:31.520 this beach house all the kids playing I  <br>00:40:33.599 was like hiding in a room reading  <br>00:40:35.000 romance novels so and this is exactly  <br>00:40:37.839 what happens with addiction is that our  <br>00:40:40.160 Focus Narrows and the things that we  <br>00:40:43.640 used to enjoy are no longer pleasurable  <br>00:40:45.920 only this one thing has salience for us  <br>00:40:48.720 we plan our whole whole day around  <br>00:40:50.599 getting it using it hiding our use um  <br>00:40:54.920 and that's what happened to me  <br>00:40:58.599 it's so interesting because I was as you  <br>00:41:00.280 were talking about that I was thinking  <br>00:41:01.319 about all the behaviors that I have that  <br>00:41:04.280 are maybe isolating me or you know I  <br>00:41:08.680 just even things like spending a lot of  <br>00:41:10.599 time on the internet just watching video  <br>00:41:12.720 after video after video on YouTube or um  <br>00:41:17.160 those kinds of things or just like  <br>00:41:18.680 spending tons of time in my WhatsApp  <br>00:41:20.520 group chat talking like roasting my  <br>00:41:22.960 friends about nothing right how do you  <br>00:41:24.760 know if like this is it's cuz on end of  <br>00:41:27.560 the spectrum I could say okay well  <br>00:41:28.680 that's harming my relationship with  <br>00:41:31.240 people in the real world but  <br>00:41:34.920 it's helping making me feel good and  <br>00:41:38.280 it's you know maybe helping me in  <br>00:41:40.480 another department because I'm learning  <br>00:41:42.200 more about vampires or you know like so  <br>00:41:46.319 like you know because there's there  <br>00:41:47.760 might be net harm somewhere else but  <br>00:41:50.680 then an upside over here which and then  <br>00:41:52.760 I start rationalizing this Behavior like  <br>00:41:55.280 how' you just distinguish between these  <br>00:41:57.599 behaviors and know what's bad and what's  <br>00:41:59.240 good you know what it's really hard um  <br>00:42:03.560 these digital devices are powerful tools  <br>00:42:07.079 but also very potent drugs there's no  <br>00:42:09.880 doubt that digital media lights up the  <br>00:42:13.160 same reward pathway as drugs and alcohol  <br>00:42:16.119 these devices and platforms were  <br>00:42:18.000 designed to be addictive that is to keep  <br>00:42:20.200 us scrolling and tapping long beyond  <br>00:42:23.800 what we plan for or what we want or even  <br>00:42:26.760 what's pleasurable I think we can all  <br>00:42:28.839 relate to using this  <br>00:42:31.599 medium to a point where we don't even  <br>00:42:35.000 like it anymore and yet have difficulty  <br>00:42:37.400 getting ourselves off of it that really  <br>00:42:39.599 speaks to the inherently reinforcing and  <br>00:42:43.680 cognitively adherent nature of this  <br>00:42:46.760 medium it is a drug and so you know if  <br>00:42:51.319 and when and how we're crossing into  <br>00:42:53.359 addictive  <br>00:42:54.400 use I think we need to be very Vig  <br>00:42:58.280 about whether that's happened in our  <br>00:43:00.319 lives and one of the ways to do that is  <br>00:43:03.079 actually to try cutting out that  <br>00:43:05.319 particular digital medium that website  <br>00:43:08.720 or that behavior for a period of time  <br>00:43:11.720 long enough to experience withdrawal  <br>00:43:14.960 potentially reset reward Pathways and  <br>00:43:17.200 then re-evaluate because when we're in  <br>00:43:19.640 the behavior as you yourself noted it's  <br>00:43:22.880 very easy to rationalize oh I need to do  <br>00:43:25.720 this for work oh I need need to do this  <br>00:43:27.520 to stay in touch with my friends oh I'm  <br>00:43:29.000 learning so much from this right and all  <br>00:43:32.520 of that may have been true initially but  <br>00:43:35.359 may not be that true anymore and what I  <br>00:43:39.119 often point to is the subtler signs of  <br>00:43:41.960 addiction which are things like  <br>00:43:43.400 depression anxiety in attention insomnia  <br>00:43:47.839 restlessness these can be early signals  <br>00:43:51.079 for our consumption entering into that  <br>00:43:54.200 addiction range but us not realizing it  <br>00:43:57.400 because again we don't see cause and  <br>00:44:00.520 effect which is why doing an experiment  <br>00:44:03.520 like I did with my romance novels you  <br>00:44:06.800 know following in the footsteps of my  <br>00:44:09.000 patients and taking the advice I give  <br>00:44:11.040 them and I gave my romance novels up for  <br>00:44:15.000 30 days right just to see like okay I  <br>00:44:18.520 think this is a problematic Behavior can  <br>00:44:20.359 I give it up how will I feel and the  <br>00:44:23.640 very first day that I the very first 24  <br>00:44:26.839 hours hours that I did not read any  <br>00:44:29.319 romance novel any novel at all I was  <br>00:44:32.599 astounded at my level of anxiety  <br>00:44:36.119 restlessness and utter insomnia I had  <br>00:44:39.839 completely unlearned the art of putting  <br>00:44:42.119 myself to sleep without this digital  <br>00:44:46.079 narrative and that lasted a good 10 to  <br>00:44:48.559 14 days completely mapping on with the  <br>00:44:50.960 amount of time it takes typically to get  <br>00:44:53.280 out of acute withdrawal that is to say  <br>00:44:55.559 for those neuro adapt PA Gremlins to hop  <br>00:44:57.960 off the pain side of the balance and for  <br>00:44:59.880 homeostasis to to begin to be re  <br>00:45:03.240 restored um but by the time I got to  <br>00:45:05.839 weeks three and four I felt not just  <br>00:45:09.000 better than I had in the first two weeks  <br>00:45:10.640 but actually better than I had felt in a  <br>00:45:12.480 really long time I enjoyed my kids more  <br>00:45:16.079 I was more present for them I enjoyed my  <br>00:45:18.760 husband more my work seemed salian again  <br>00:45:21.079 I had started to think oh maybe I should  <br>00:45:22.800 do something else you know maybe maybe I  <br>00:45:25.720 you know this work I've been doing it a  <br>00:45:26.800 long long time I don't it's not that  <br>00:45:28.359 interesting anymore all of a sudden it  <br>00:45:30.720 was interesting again right so you see  <br>00:45:33.440 the relativity of that honic pathway and  <br>00:45:36.760 how when we're doing that behavior or  <br>00:45:38.599 substance that's so reinforcing that  <br>00:45:40.559 everything else loses its salience we  <br>00:45:42.960 can really  <br>00:45:44.559 misidentify what is causing our  <br>00:45:47.680 irritability anxiety insomnia until we  <br>00:45:51.000 stop that substance for long enough to  <br>00:45:53.559 see its impact on our lives how is it  <br>00:45:55.800 making you feel because I think a lot of  <br>00:45:58.400 a lot of people can't understand how you  <br>00:45:59.880 could get addicted to a book I'm sure  <br>00:46:03.559 some people understand that but but for  <br>00:46:04.920 me it's not something I've ever become  <br>00:46:07.079 addicted to so how how did it feel was  <br>00:46:09.359 it like exciting is it arousing is it  <br>00:46:13.160 somewhere in  <br>00:46:14.319 between I mean I think that romance  <br>00:46:17.319 novels are essentially socially  <br>00:46:19.800 sanctioned pornography for women okay  <br>00:46:22.319 and the medium is narrative and if  <br>00:46:24.480 you're a person for whom narrative is a  <br>00:46:26.359 powerful drug as it is for me a story a  <br>00:46:28.960 narrative a fiction um very potent since  <br>00:46:32.000 I was a child then you know it was a  <br>00:46:35.119 natural that that that would be the  <br>00:46:37.160 thing that I would get addicted to and  <br>00:46:39.000 basically just like we've hacked and  <br>00:46:41.800 bioengineered everything to make it more  <br>00:46:44.240 potent I mean people there's a formula  <br>00:46:46.400 for writing romance novels like if you  <br>00:46:48.599 take a physical copy if you go to a  <br>00:46:50.400 store and you pick up a romance novel  <br>00:46:52.319 and you literally physically open it to  <br>00:46:54.520 2third of the way through you will get  <br>00:46:56.559 to the climactic scene pun intended  <br>00:46:59.559 right it's it's like it's  <br>00:47:01.480 engineered I mean I got to a point where  <br>00:47:05.000 I wouldn't even read it read after I  <br>00:47:06.800 wouldn't finish the book I would go on  <br>00:47:08.720 to the next book just to get to the  <br>00:47:10.400 climax part and then you'd move yeah and  <br>00:47:12.000 I wouldn't even read the danum ma or  <br>00:47:13.720 like what happens to the characters I  <br>00:47:15.480 didn't care you didn't care about no and  <br>00:47:17.839 also I didn't I got to point where I  <br>00:47:19.079 didn't care about the quality of the  <br>00:47:20.240 writing or the depth of the car it  <br>00:47:22.240 didn't matter it was it was the drug it  <br>00:47:24.440 was that moment I was looking for and  <br>00:47:26.640 you know there are a lot of free books  <br>00:47:28.400 on Amazon some some of which are high  <br>00:47:30.400 quality and some of which are not but  <br>00:47:32.119 like you know any good drug dealer knows  <br>00:47:33.800 free samples that's the way you hook  <br>00:47:35.599 people I would search for these free  <br>00:47:37.440 samples and that's part of it too like  <br>00:47:39.000 the searching for the drug so the  <br>00:47:40.920 Working The Upfront work you do for the  <br>00:47:43.160 drug is part of the drug right it's all  <br>00:47:46.680 that you know the machinations and the  <br>00:47:48.760 hiding and the this and the that that  <br>00:47:51.000 gets to be part of like all of the  <br>00:47:53.160 rituals surrounding it as you were  <br>00:47:55.200 talking as well I thought about work and  <br>00:47:57.000 work addiction yes because you earlier  <br>00:47:59.680 used the term excessive consumption and  <br>00:48:02.480 when I think about work even my work I  <br>00:48:04.200 Think Jesus I excessively consume work I  <br>00:48:08.040 start so many bloody businesses and  <br>00:48:10.400 invest in so many things and if you look  <br>00:48:12.440 to that behavior objectively if you're  <br>00:48:13.920 like an alien looking down at me you'd  <br>00:48:15.280 go this guy's got a [ __ ] problem do  <br>00:48:17.480 you know what I mean you think you think  <br>00:48:18.960 that's funny joking you  <br>00:48:24.480 know I feel for you and it's funny cuz  <br>00:48:27.640 in society we then those people are  <br>00:48:29.760 reinforced we clap that's right we clap  <br>00:48:32.559 we got this guy's not sleeping he's  <br>00:48:33.880 working 18 hours a day clap clap clap  <br>00:48:36.800 give him a trophy an award name a thing  <br>00:48:39.280 after him or her or right you know um  <br>00:48:42.960 and it's just really interesting that  <br>00:48:44.440 that that addiction of work and you tell  <br>00:48:46.880 me if it is it can be an addiction it's  <br>00:48:48.559 certainly in the scale of one end being  <br>00:48:50.240 sort of consumption excessive  <br>00:48:52.000 consumption in the other hand being  <br>00:48:53.079 addiction it's on there somewhere people  <br>00:48:55.520 can get addicted to work  <br>00:48:57.280 and part of the reason is that we've  <br>00:48:59.000 drug aied work right when when I say  <br>00:49:01.040 drug aied what do I mean we've made it  <br>00:49:02.720 more potent and this is true for all all  <br>00:49:04.760 these drugs we've made them more potent  <br>00:49:06.760 more novel more Bountiful meaning  <br>00:49:09.319 there's more of it and more accessible  <br>00:49:11.640 so if we if we break that down with work  <br>00:49:13.400 how is work more potent well certain  <br>00:49:16.359 types of work are more reinforcing not  <br>00:49:18.520 all types of work so for example Works  <br>00:49:21.880 work White Collar work is often now  <br>00:49:24.960 associated with stock options and  <br>00:49:27.079 bonuses right um there's often like a  <br>00:49:29.920 social media aspect to it or maybe even  <br>00:49:32.880 a Fame aspect or as you point out those  <br>00:49:35.280 are our cultural Heroes right so you get  <br>00:49:37.640 all this you know agulation for being a  <br>00:49:41.200 workaholic and that also because we're  <br>00:49:43.599 such social creatures right and human  <br>00:49:45.359 connection stimulates dope mean that  <br>00:49:47.480 that also makes work more of a potent  <br>00:49:50.760 drug personal brand right so you're  <br>00:49:52.760 LinkedIn oh my God this person got a  <br>00:49:54.880 promotion we all clap we the likes the  <br>00:49:57.200 comments you're amazing the agulation  <br>00:49:58.720 the a as you said the awards the  <br>00:50:00.720 trophies and then you've got um the fact  <br>00:50:04.040 the fact of novelty so once we've  <br>00:50:06.640 exposed our brains enough times to a  <br>00:50:09.520 certain drug as I said we develop  <br>00:50:11.079 tolerance right and then we need more  <br>00:50:13.760 potent forms or novel forms one of the  <br>00:50:15.960 ways we overcome tolerance is by taking  <br>00:50:18.799 our drug and then changing it slightly  <br>00:50:20.760 like adding a little new molecule on  <br>00:50:23.280 this chemical right or on the Internet  <br>00:50:25.920 you know when we're searching videos we  <br>00:50:27.720 want something similar to what we liked  <br>00:50:29.359 before but just a little bit different  <br>00:50:31.240 and that's what the algorithm does  <br>00:50:32.480 automatically right it offers oh you  <br>00:50:34.359 should check this out oh how about this  <br>00:50:35.799 oh check that out right and that engages  <br>00:50:37.680 our treasure seeking function we're  <br>00:50:39.319 looking for that that novel thing but  <br>00:50:41.480 that's not too novel right it has to be  <br>00:50:43.640 in our category of things we like and I  <br>00:50:45.520 think for work we have that too like  <br>00:50:47.160 there are so many ways now that people  <br>00:50:48.680 can engage in their work and it's not  <br>00:50:50.240 all bad that it's novel but you know  <br>00:50:52.640 certain types of work it makes it very  <br>00:50:54.480 enticing then you have quantity  <br>00:50:57.160 right I mean work never ends there's  <br>00:50:59.160 like no natural stopping point for work  <br>00:51:01.880 you know you do a line of cocaine you  <br>00:51:04.079 run out of money you run out of cocaine  <br>00:51:05.920 you're done right but that's not true  <br>00:51:08.720 for work everywhere anytime and then  <br>00:51:11.799 that gets to  <br>00:51:12.880 accessibility one of the biggest risk  <br>00:51:14.960 factors for addiction to any drug or  <br>00:51:16.880 behavior is simple access we know that  <br>00:51:19.559 if you grow up in a neighborhood where  <br>00:51:21.000 drugs are sold on a street corner you're  <br>00:51:22.960 more likely to try them more likely to  <br>00:51:24.680 get addicted if you live in a world  <br>00:51:27.119 where you have access to work  <br>00:51:29.839 24/7 you're more likely to expose your  <br>00:51:32.960 brain to more work and more likely to  <br>00:51:34.440 get addicted to work again especially if  <br>00:51:36.119 it's got all those other reinforcing  <br>00:51:38.680 qualities this is probably in part why  <br>00:51:41.079 people quit their  <br>00:51:42.720 jobs you mean if they just get  <br>00:51:44.599 overwhelmed or it's it's partially why  <br>00:51:46.440 people can never quit but I think it's  <br>00:51:48.359 important to make a distinction between  <br>00:51:49.960 work that's reinforcing in those ways  <br>00:51:52.640 and then work that's completely not  <br>00:51:55.160 reinforcing yeah  <br>00:51:57.280 alienating mind-numbing work in which  <br>00:52:00.720 the the actual task is separated from  <br>00:52:03.359 the meaning of a task I mean they quit  <br>00:52:05.559 their jobs either in search of more  <br>00:52:07.000 dopamine so if I'm working in a job  <br>00:52:09.319 where I don't know maybe it once gave me  <br>00:52:11.040 dopamine and now it's become monotonous  <br>00:52:13.240 and the same right I I need to quit to  <br>00:52:15.640 go find but there's novelty for you  <br>00:52:17.559 that's right yeah and that's true people  <br>00:52:19.799 many people change jobs every two to  <br>00:52:21.599 three years I I recently read that the  <br>00:52:24.000 the average life of a business now is  <br>00:52:26.200 like 15 years whereas you know 50 years  <br>00:52:29.559 ago it was 50 years and there's all this  <br>00:52:32.160 turnover all this churn chasing novelty  <br>00:52:35.200 also you know I I do want to emphasize  <br>00:52:36.920 that people who are in work that's not  <br>00:52:38.920 like intrinsically rewarding but is the  <br>00:52:41.599 opposite kind of soul sucking that's  <br>00:52:44.319 also a risk factor for addiction because  <br>00:52:46.200 people just wait till the end of the day  <br>00:52:47.680 till they can go home and then use a  <br>00:52:50.079 drug to numb themselves from the stress  <br>00:52:52.720 of work so it's it's plausible that  <br>00:52:55.119 people who are in lower pleasure jobs  <br>00:52:57.760 are more likely to be overweight or  <br>00:52:59.720 addicted or dependent on alcohol yeah or  <br>00:53:02.640 simply opt out of the workforce as many  <br>00:53:04.599 young men are doing now in the United  <br>00:53:06.280 States and what we know from data that's  <br>00:53:08.640 been collected is many of them are  <br>00:53:09.960 playing video games right they've just  <br>00:53:11.720 completely opted out of the workforce I  <br>00:53:14.119 guess this in part explains why there's  <br>00:53:15.839 a drinking culture that's associated  <br>00:53:18.400 with people who are potentially lower  <br>00:53:21.200 class um because they're doing um  <br>00:53:25.559 potentially  <br>00:53:27.480 less pleasurable work  <br>00:53:30.400 and they're therefore they if we think  <br>00:53:33.160 about the scale that they would then end  <br>00:53:35.160 up in the pub after work you know maybe  <br>00:53:38.040 that's partially true but even people  <br>00:53:40.280 doing like doctors and lawyers they're  <br>00:53:42.520 are oh okay yeah equal rates of  <br>00:53:44.799 alcoholism among those groups I think  <br>00:53:47.839 what's happening there though is that  <br>00:53:49.280 the nature of the work is just so  <br>00:53:51.359 stressful whether it's white collar or  <br>00:53:53.160 blue collar that there's this kind of  <br>00:53:55.000 work hard play hard right I'm going to  <br>00:53:56.799 work all day and at the end of the day  <br>00:53:58.119 I'm going to reward myself so now you've  <br>00:53:59.680 got a pleasure pain balance that's going  <br>00:54:01.119 pleasure pain pleasure pain and and  <br>00:54:02.559 remember the biological definition of  <br>00:54:04.960 stress is any deviation from  <br>00:54:08.079 neutrality so that every time our brain  <br>00:54:11.440 has to work to restore a level balance  <br>00:54:14.079 we're actually triggering our stress  <br>00:54:15.960 response triggering our own adrenaline  <br>00:54:18.559 it's stressful to have to restore the  <br>00:54:21.200 balance from those extremes of Pleasure  <br>00:54:23.359 and Pain I read in um your book you were  <br>00:54:25.640 talking about how different behaviors  <br>00:54:27.559 and sort of chemicals and substances  <br>00:54:29.240 have different impacts and I was on page  <br>00:54:31.520 50 of dopamin nation in a study of mice  <br>00:54:34.359 sex increases the release of dopamine by  <br>00:54:36.359 100% And amphetamines which is like  <br>00:54:39.359 drugs right hardcore drugs increases it  <br>00:54:42.079 by 1,000% by this accounting one hit of  <br>00:54:45.400 a meth pipe is equal to 10 orgasms yes  <br>00:54:48.680 it's interesting to think about that the  <br>00:54:50.760 different behaviors we have and how  <br>00:54:52.440 they'll have a bigger impact on our  <br>00:54:53.839 dopamine is there like any in an in in  <br>00:54:58.160 typical order of things that are like  <br>00:54:59.920 extremely dopamine inducing and things  <br>00:55:01.680 that aren't what's it like the top and  <br>00:55:03.799 bottom of the list but in your view you  <br>00:55:06.599 know I really think that it depends on  <br>00:55:09.680 the person and we've got to look at drug  <br>00:55:11.920 of choice right I mean potent drugs like  <br>00:55:15.799 methamphetamine like opioids like  <br>00:55:17.839 alcohol like nicotine like cannabis um  <br>00:55:21.400 are are going to be very reinforcing for  <br>00:55:25.000 many people but not for all people and  <br>00:55:28.000 most people do have their one drug that  <br>00:55:30.200 they sort of prefer above all others so  <br>00:55:33.880 although generally speaking intoxicants  <br>00:55:36.039 release a lot of dopamine in the reward  <br>00:55:37.920 pathway um I think every person is going  <br>00:55:40.799 to be different and also we we don't  <br>00:55:42.920 really have good ways of measuring  <br>00:55:44.839 absolute values of dopamine in human  <br>00:55:47.520 beings right we can do that in rats but  <br>00:55:50.039 we can't really do that in humans it's  <br>00:55:51.960 it's relative values I've got this um  <br>00:55:54.640 picture here which shows what looks like  <br>00:55:56.720 brain scans in uh normal person but then  <br>00:56:00.240 in someone who's addicted to different  <br>00:56:01.880 substances I'll put this on the screen  <br>00:56:03.119 and I'll link it below in the  <br>00:56:04.440 description for anyone that needs it and  <br>00:56:06.119 wants to see it but it effectively shows  <br>00:56:08.319 the impact that like cocaine has on the  <br>00:56:10.160 brain meth um alcohol and heroin what is  <br>00:56:13.920 what is going on here so the red in this  <br>00:56:16.640 image represents dopamine transmission  <br>00:56:19.720 okay so how much dope mean is being  <br>00:56:21.520 released from the pr synaptic neuron  <br>00:56:23.480 Crossing that synapse binding to  <br>00:56:25.520 receptors on the Sy aptic neuron how  <br>00:56:27.319 much dopamine is kind of swirling around  <br>00:56:29.520 in the reward pathway part of the brain  <br>00:56:32.599 and what this image shows is that on the  <br>00:56:35.640 left hand side in healthy control  <br>00:56:37.880 subjects who do not have addiction  <br>00:56:40.760 there's plenty of red right so there's  <br>00:56:43.160 plenty of dopamine Transmission in the  <br>00:56:45.559 reward pathway specifically here in the  <br>00:56:48.039 nucleus accumbens but if you look at the  <br>00:56:50.680 right hand column you'll see that in  <br>00:56:52.960 these individuals who have been using  <br>00:56:55.319 cocaine meth amphetamine alcohol and  <br>00:56:57.720 heroin in addictive ways there's almost  <br>00:57:01.039 no red which means there's decreased or  <br>00:57:05.480 below normal levels of dopamine  <br>00:57:08.799 transmission they are in a chronic  <br>00:57:11.760 dopamine deficit  <br>00:57:14.920 State this is evidence of the brain  <br>00:57:18.880 trying to  <br>00:57:20.880 compensate for too much dopamine being  <br>00:57:24.160 triggered by down regulating its own  <br>00:57:27.119 dopamine production and transmission not  <br>00:57:29.319 just to Baseline but below  <br>00:57:31.599 Baseline and importantly these  <br>00:57:34.400 individuals who are addicted to these  <br>00:57:36.440 substances these brain scans were done  <br>00:57:39.079 two weeks after they stopped  <br>00:57:41.599 using oh wow yeah which tells us that  <br>00:57:45.079 this dop dopamine deficit State persists  <br>00:57:48.520 for some period of Time how long well it  <br>00:57:51.960 depends on the person but we know at  <br>00:57:53.839 least from this experiment that the  <br>00:57:55.799 first two weeks are this persistent  <br>00:57:58.480 dopamine deficit state which is  <br>00:58:00.680 consistent with acute withdrawal right  <br>00:58:03.240 people feel when they first stop their  <br>00:58:05.039 drug of choice they feel terrible right  <br>00:58:07.880 they experience all of the symptoms of  <br>00:58:10.119 physical withdrawal that correspond with  <br>00:58:12.400 that particular drug they were using  <br>00:58:14.599 usually the opposite of what the drug  <br>00:58:16.160 did plus the universal symptoms of  <br>00:58:18.480 withdrawal from any addictive substance  <br>00:58:20.240 or behavior anxiety irritability  <br>00:58:22.960 insomnia depression and craving now if  <br>00:58:25.520 they can get through the first 10 to 14  <br>00:58:28.240 days what we see clinically is those  <br>00:58:31.799 acute withdrawal symptoms slowly start  <br>00:58:34.480 to get better and we think that that is  <br>00:58:37.319 mapping on to regenerating dopamine  <br>00:58:40.920 Transmission in the reward pathway and  <br>00:58:43.640 if they can make it to a month that's  <br>00:58:46.000 usually the point for for on average in  <br>00:58:48.920 based on clinical experience when people  <br>00:58:51.359 really can start to get out of that  <br>00:58:54.319 constant state of craving for their drug  <br>00:58:56.359 of choice and begin to see some light at  <br>00:58:58.680 the end of the tunnel for what their  <br>00:59:00.200 lives might look like if they can  <br>00:59:03.039 maintain abstinence from their drug and  <br>00:59:05.280 we can't just inject or drink dopamine I  <br>00:59:07.960 mean I guess that would be like drinking  <br>00:59:09.079 alcohol we can't just artificially mess  <br>00:59:11.640 with the the balances to try and restore  <br>00:59:13.240 the dopamine levels in an addict can we  <br>00:59:15.079 can't just add a little bit of dopamine  <br>00:59:16.640 yeah it's it's a great question because  <br>00:59:18.760 we have some natural experiments that  <br>00:59:21.119 suggest what what might happen if we do  <br>00:59:23.000 that so as I mentioned before people  <br>00:59:25.000 with Parkinson's have depletion of DOP  <br>00:59:27.280 mean in the substan [ __ ] That's What  <br>00:59:29.559 Causes That that motor disease the  <br>00:59:32.480 treatment for it is to give L Doopa  <br>00:59:36.240 which is a dopamine precursor if I were  <br>00:59:38.400 to give you a spoonful of dopamine it  <br>00:59:39.799 would do absolutely nothing because it  <br>00:59:41.000 doesn't cross into the bra the brain it  <br>00:59:42.880 doesn't cross the blood brain barrier  <br>00:59:44.520 but I could give you lopa which is a  <br>00:59:46.839 precursor chemical that would cross your  <br>00:59:48.960 blood brain barrier and get turned into  <br>00:59:51.520 dopamine and then diffusely bind  <br>00:59:54.079 dopamine receptors in your brain in the  <br>00:59:56.240 reward pathway but also in the movement  <br>00:59:58.880 Pathways when we give patients with  <br>01:00:02.119 Parkinson's dopamine in this form that  <br>01:00:06.319 can temporarily improve their movements  <br>01:00:08.880 but in about one in four Parkinson's  <br>01:00:11.400 patients they will develop a denovo  <br>01:00:14.559 addictive disorder shopping addiction  <br>01:00:17.359 sex addiction other types of addiction  <br>01:00:20.599 because we have the same problem we are  <br>01:00:23.760 stimulating  <br>01:00:26.119 the reward pathway with dopamine that is  <br>01:00:29.599 ingested exogenously from the  <br>01:00:32.680 outside and our brain reads that as oh  <br>01:00:35.559 boy got to compensate by downregulating  <br>01:00:38.559 dopamine transmission to below Baseline  <br>01:00:41.400 which then puts us in that addiction  <br>01:00:43.280 Vortex does that make sense it does so  <br>01:00:45.440 we have to I mean it tells me that we  <br>01:00:47.520 have to live lives in a certain sense of  <br>01:00:51.839 we have to live our lives in a certain  <br>01:00:53.160 sort of  <br>01:00:54.680 homeostasis and  <br>01:00:56.440 it's so easy not to in the world we live  <br>01:00:58.799 in it's like it's like impossible to  <br>01:01:00.559 live in a perfect homeostasis balance in  <br>01:01:04.359 the world we live in right even more  <br>01:01:07.640 than having to try to live within this  <br>01:01:09.839 sort of narrow range of homeostasis in  <br>01:01:12.400 the world we live in today we probably  <br>01:01:13.920 have to intentionally do things that are  <br>01:01:16.599 painful do things that are hard pleasure  <br>01:01:19.480 pain balance like we learn that when we  <br>01:01:21.839 press on the pleasure side of the  <br>01:01:23.920 balance like with alcohol or pornography  <br>01:01:26.880 or romance novels or cannabis or  <br>01:01:28.720 whatever it is right no sooner does that  <br>01:01:31.640 happen than our brain adapts by those  <br>01:01:35.160 neuro adaptation Gremlins hopping on the  <br>01:01:36.920 pain side of the balance to bring it  <br>01:01:38.319 level again but they like it on the  <br>01:01:39.680 balance so they don't get off right when  <br>01:01:41.400 it's level they stay on until we're  <br>01:01:43.079 tilted an equal an opposite amount to  <br>01:01:45.359 the side of pain that's the come down  <br>01:01:46.760 the hangover Etc but it turns out the  <br>01:01:49.520 opposite is also true if we  <br>01:01:51.039 intentionally press on the pain side of  <br>01:01:53.279 the balance for example with exercise or  <br>01:01:56.480 an ice cold water bath or intermittent  <br>01:01:58.760 fasting those Gremlins will hop on the  <br>01:02:01.119 pleasure side of the balance and we will  <br>01:02:03.119 get our dopamine indirectly by paying  <br>01:02:05.640 for it up front and there are studies in  <br>01:02:09.119 humans showing that when humans expose  <br>01:02:12.880 themselves to exercise for  <br>01:02:15.039 example dopamine levels gradually rise  <br>01:02:18.200 over the latter half of the exercise and  <br>01:02:20.440 then when the exercise stops dopamine  <br>01:02:22.920 levels will remain elevated for hours  <br>01:02:25.599 after afterwards before going back down  <br>01:02:28.200 to the Baseline level position without  <br>01:02:31.079 ever going into that dopamine deficit  <br>01:02:33.160 state so it's a great way to get our  <br>01:02:35.279 dopamine in directly because it's much  <br>01:02:37.880 less vulnerable to that compulsive  <br>01:02:41.200 craving phenomenon of overuse so you're  <br>01:02:43.400 not going to get an exercise come down  <br>01:02:46.599 you can butc and people can get addicted  <br>01:02:49.920 to exercise right but typically it's  <br>01:02:52.480 it's very unusual because The Upfront  <br>01:02:55.240 cost  <br>01:02:56.440 to to do the work and endure the pain of  <br>01:02:59.720 exercise in the first place mitigates  <br>01:03:02.880 our vulnerability to an exercise  <br>01:03:04.960 addiction and in general H okay CU it's  <br>01:03:06.960 so hard to do that it's going to be it's  <br>01:03:09.119 not like pulling a lever on a slot  <br>01:03:10.559 machine or clicking on a porn website is  <br>01:03:13.599 difficult yes okay so fighting for the  <br>01:03:16.480 dopamine  <br>01:03:18.599 is insulates us against the chance of an  <br>01:03:21.279 addiction having to really fight hard  <br>01:03:22.640 for it okay yeah and this kind of  <br>01:03:24.160 explains I guess in part why  <br>01:03:26.559 I pulled out some stats ahead of our  <br>01:03:28.400 conversation today that from 1996 to  <br>01:03:31.880 2008 participation in ultramarathons has  <br>01:03:35.400 increased by  <br>01:03:39.240 1,676 the ice bath Market is expected to  <br>01:03:42.440 rise from 350 million in 2024 to to  <br>01:03:45.640 nearly half a billion by 2030 the number  <br>01:03:49.279 of people taking part in obstacle course  <br>01:03:51.200 races like tough mut or hrock etc etc  <br>01:03:54.319 has increased by almost 7x from 2010 to  <br>01:03:58.119 2017 it seems like in society there's  <br>01:04:00.359 this counter movement towards people  <br>01:04:02.440 seeking out hard dopamine chasing pain  <br>01:04:06.039 yeah those are amazing I didn't know  <br>01:04:07.480 that those are amazing numbers um you  <br>01:04:10.000 know in general there's a part of me  <br>01:04:11.640 that wants to say well that's a good  <br>01:04:13.279 thing um but there there's another part  <br>01:04:15.839 of me that's wary also because we're so  <br>01:04:18.599 good at drug aying everything that we do  <br>01:04:21.319 that there's a way in which these types  <br>01:04:23.359 of behaviors can also be drug aied right  <br>01:04:26.160 made more potent with all of the  <br>01:04:28.400 technology the way that we count  <br>01:04:30.160 ourselves the leaderboards the social  <br>01:04:32.799 comparisons all of that takes this thing  <br>01:04:34.960 which is really in its natural state  <br>01:04:38.079 kind of impervious to addiction like you  <br>01:04:40.359 just typically wouldn't get addicted to  <br>01:04:42.520 these types of painful physical  <br>01:04:44.960 activities you would do what you needed  <br>01:04:46.920 to do for survival but we've managed to  <br>01:04:49.839 make them addictive in all these  <br>01:04:51.240 different ways I still think it's a  <br>01:04:53.799 better way to get your dopamine like I  <br>01:04:55.400 really encourage exercise we always talk  <br>01:04:57.799 about movement as medicine and in  <br>01:05:00.240 general our our life is so convenient so  <br>01:05:02.960 easy so passive so sedentary that I'm  <br>01:05:05.920 telling patients all the time you know  <br>01:05:07.799 get up off the couch move your body walk  <br>01:05:10.079 around the block I think that's the  <br>01:05:12.480 bigger obstacle right now is just  <br>01:05:14.319 getting people to move but I do think we  <br>01:05:16.920 need to be wary of not going too far in  <br>01:05:19.440 the direction of like the ultra Ultra  <br>01:05:21.799 Ultra whatever it is so what is a better  <br>01:05:23.880 way to live if we're trying to optimize  <br>01:05:25.760 happiness and to keep our dopamine in  <br>01:05:27.279 balance and not have the crashes Etc and  <br>01:05:29.400 come downs and hangover what is a  <br>01:05:31.839 optimal way to live our lives do we have  <br>01:05:33.279 to look back at our caveman ancestors  <br>01:05:36.000 and live like them I think that part of  <br>01:05:39.640 the problem is that we've  <br>01:05:41.680 organized Our Lives now around  <br>01:05:45.960 rewards almost everything that we do is  <br>01:05:49.160 predicated on the Feelgood moment we'll  <br>01:05:52.640 have at the end of it and because of  <br>01:05:55.480 that that we  <br>01:05:56.960 are missing out on the  <br>01:05:59.599 process we're projecting our psyche  <br>01:06:02.440 forward into the future toward the  <br>01:06:04.480 reward and not able to really be here in  <br>01:06:08.279 the moment okay this is going to be  <br>01:06:10.000 sound weird I'm going to give you a  <br>01:06:11.000 weird example so driving over here today  <br>01:06:13.440 I found I was nervous for this interview  <br>01:06:16.880 and in a way looking forward to it but  <br>01:06:19.279 in a way wanting it to be over right and  <br>01:06:22.760 and in seeing that in myself I thought  <br>01:06:24.640 that's so sad like that's that's so sad  <br>01:06:27.079 that we live our lives that way myself  <br>01:06:29.000 included always this weird blend of  <br>01:06:31.920 wanting whatever we're doing to be over  <br>01:06:34.119 so that in a way we can just go hide and  <br>01:06:35.760 do whatever that self- steem thing is  <br>01:06:37.880 that we do where we're safe and we're  <br>01:06:39.799 like you know stimulating ourselves in  <br>01:06:41.839 some way and then I thought well what if  <br>01:06:44.559 I knew that I was going to die right  <br>01:06:47.599 after this going come off really weird  <br>01:06:50.480 now but what if I knew that I was  <br>01:06:52.520 actually going to die right after our  <br>01:06:54.119 conversation today  <br>01:06:56.359 that totally changes my perspective  <br>01:06:58.119 doesn't it because this time you and I  <br>01:07:00.240 have that's all I got it's over for me  <br>01:07:02.559 when this so this this conversation is  <br>01:07:04.599 it I really better be right here right  <br>01:07:06.599 now and really taking joy in whatever  <br>01:07:10.760 you and I can find together and and I  <br>01:07:13.119 think the more we can do that the better  <br>01:07:17.079 what's happening there you're removing  <br>01:07:18.799 the thought of the outcome the rewards  <br>01:07:20.799 the potential you know failure or  <br>01:07:22.599 whatever and you're focusing on just  <br>01:07:24.359 being present and in doing so what is  <br>01:07:27.160 happening it's a great question and I've  <br>01:07:29.839 actually given this quite a lot of  <br>01:07:31.160 thought because I remember when I was in  <br>01:07:32.799 college and I you know met some like Zen  <br>01:07:36.599 people and they were like be here now be  <br>01:07:39.520 here now and I thought well whenever I'm  <br>01:07:42.880 here now I'm miserable like I I I don't  <br>01:07:45.880 like me and I don't like being in the  <br>01:07:48.200 world I I don't want to be here now I  <br>01:07:50.279 want to be somewhere else so I didn't  <br>01:07:53.520 really understand what they were getting  <br>01:07:55.200 at  <br>01:07:55.960 it really took me you know till I had  <br>01:07:58.279 lived quite a lot of life and had some  <br>01:08:00.319 you know some significant experiences  <br>01:08:02.760 and given it some thought that I  <br>01:08:04.200 realized oh be here now means be here  <br>01:08:07.599 now and be  <br>01:08:09.079 uncomfortable and be okay with being  <br>01:08:12.520 uncomfortable and being okay with not  <br>01:08:14.680 being able to  <br>01:08:16.520 control my pleasure or my pain or my  <br>01:08:19.479 comfort level but just being open to  <br>01:08:21.960 whatever comes and I think that's a  <br>01:08:24.198 really a key shift  <br>01:08:26.880 that I'm not trying to control my  <br>01:08:29.439 experience in the moment and that it's  <br>01:08:31.880 okay to be unhappy or Restless or  <br>01:08:35.679 uncomfortable and not trying to run away  <br>01:08:37.920 from that but just really turn and face  <br>01:08:39.719 it and embrace the discomfort which I  <br>01:08:42.640 also think is quite Universal I don't  <br>01:08:44.560 think I'm I'm alone in that and then the  <br>01:08:48.040 key piece about not not anticipating the  <br>01:08:50.679 reward is helps me be in the moment  <br>01:08:54.880 right because I'm not just waiting for  <br>01:08:56.640 the good thing to come after I'm saying  <br>01:08:58.719 to myself imagine there's nothing good  <br>01:09:00.319 coming after nothing at all right  <br>01:09:02.600 there's just there aren't rewards this  <br>01:09:04.359 is it and then also being able to say  <br>01:09:07.520 and it's okay if in the moment like it's  <br>01:09:10.600 not great like I I can Embrace that you  <br>01:09:13.520 know I can be unhappy or Restless or  <br>01:09:18.000 anxious or whatever it is and then when  <br>01:09:20.759 I do that you know I feel like there's a  <br>01:09:23.399 funny funny thing that happens and all  <br>01:09:25.158 the sudden I I'm not as anxious right  <br>01:09:28.759 and I am present and it there is some  <br>01:09:32.158 Joy there interesting so when you allow  <br>01:09:35.279 yourself to deal with being  <br>01:09:36.279 uncomfortable in the moment it turns out  <br>01:09:39.839 you it removes the thing that was making  <br>01:09:41.520 you uncomfortable in the moment which is  <br>01:09:43.040 like the avoidance or the worry or  <br>01:09:45.759 overthinking whatever else yeah I I  <br>01:09:48.000 think we have this and it's fed by  <br>01:09:49.839 modern culture this kind of expectancy  <br>01:09:52.198 that really we should be happy all the  <br>01:09:54.440 time and if you know if we've arranged  <br>01:09:56.800 things appropriately for our lives and  <br>01:09:59.120 if we've done our work and you know  <br>01:10:01.760 aimed true then we should just be like  <br>01:10:04.400 life is great and I don't believe that  <br>01:10:07.600 anymore I think that you know I mean  <br>01:10:10.960 like Buddha said life is suffering but I  <br>01:10:13.880 really think that  <br>01:10:16.000 fundamentally like it's uncomfortable to  <br>01:10:19.040 be  <br>01:10:20.080 alive and that it's a kind of a constant  <br>01:10:22.719 state of restlessness and discomfort if  <br>01:10:25.000 we're being really honest and and tuning  <br>01:10:27.120 in when I really let myself see that and  <br>01:10:30.080 feel that all of a sudden I'm I'm freed  <br>01:10:34.280 from from some of  <br>01:10:38.400 that what has caused your anxiety  <br>01:10:40.640 throughout your life in the moment you  <br>01:10:42.400 you referenced earlier that some things  <br>01:10:43.719 have happened that have led you to  <br>01:10:46.040 understand this better and understand  <br>01:10:47.760 yourself better what is what am I  <br>01:10:49.520 missing from this jsaw puzzle yeah well  <br>01:10:51.560 you're you're good you could have been a  <br>01:10:53.199 psychiatrist oh really yeah it's always  <br>01:10:55.640 time this doesn't work out there's still  <br>01:10:57.880 time right it's not too late you get a  <br>01:10:59.360 new profession yay um I think you know  <br>01:11:01.719 for me the the big Turning Point um was  <br>01:11:05.280 that we lost our we lost a child and um  <br>01:11:10.120 in the immediate aftermath of our  <br>01:11:12.000 child's death I was just determined to  <br>01:11:16.199 like sort of undo the experience  <br>01:11:19.560 and um you know get enough Psychotherapy  <br>01:11:24.960 and enough whatever whatever it took to  <br>01:11:28.679 sort of not feel that pain and it wasn't  <br>01:11:31.440 until I really just said oh like I'm  <br>01:11:33.560 going to feel this pain for the rest of  <br>01:11:35.159 my life it's never going away that  <br>01:11:36.880 suddenly I felt some relief from that  <br>01:11:38.920 pain and that was a real window for  <br>01:11:42.040 me so interesting that the  <br>01:11:46.800 it's  <br>01:11:49.080 acceptance yeah and and you know and and  <br>01:11:52.000 I think you know one of the reasons I  <br>01:11:53.760 love treating patients with addiction is  <br>01:11:56.400 because I really relate to that hitting  <br>01:11:59.159 bottom moment you know that moment when  <br>01:12:01.719 it's like you just have the feeling that  <br>01:12:05.159 like everything I try to do to manage  <br>01:12:08.760 this Behavior or to make my life better  <br>01:12:10.800 only makes it worse I felt like I had a  <br>01:12:13.440 very similar  <br>01:12:14.840 experience um and that it was only when  <br>01:12:17.800 I kind of realized oh I yeah I I can't  <br>01:12:22.199 run from this I cannot run this pain uh  <br>01:12:25.000 that I I begin to have some the  <br>01:12:27.520 beginnings of relief from that  <br>01:12:29.920 experience I can't outrun this  <br>01:12:32.920 pain it's all natural sort of  <br>01:12:35.600 disposition to try and outrun pain isn't  <br>01:12:37.199 it that's the irony right we're really  <br>01:12:39.600 wired to outrun the pain we are like we  <br>01:12:42.480 reflexively seek out pleasure and avoid  <br>01:12:44.600 pain and yet that's the very thing thing  <br>01:12:46.920 that doesn't get us to where we want to  <br>01:12:48.880 go but we do now live in a world where  <br>01:12:52.040 it's very easy to outrun the pain yes  <br>01:12:54.800 this is a lion that's chasing me this  <br>01:12:56.679 could be a bad email and then I open up  <br>01:12:58.880 a tab and start Doom scrolling or open  <br>01:13:01.440 up a tab and start watching video  <br>01:13:03.400 playing video games or pornography or  <br>01:13:05.440 whatever yeah that's exactly right there  <br>01:13:07.960 are so many ways that we can now  <br>01:13:09.639 distract ourselves from you know our own  <br>01:13:12.239 suffering or our own  <br>01:13:14.080 awareness and where do you find yourself  <br>01:13:16.040 now with dealing with that grief and the  <br>01:13:18.400 pain as we sit here yeah I mean I I feel  <br>01:13:22.080 like in many ways it's been a real gift  <br>01:13:24.159 in my life you know it's really informed  <br>01:13:26.480 my life in in ways that um I mean I I've  <br>01:13:31.480 learned things from that experience that  <br>01:13:33.560 I think it would have been almost  <br>01:13:35.199 impossible for me to learn otherwise you  <br>01:13:38.040 deal with a lot of people that are in a  <br>01:13:40.480 state of  <br>01:13:42.040 suffering  <br>01:13:44.840 I imagine that's a  <br>01:13:47.040 weight because I um even hearing the  <br>01:13:50.000 story of the lady that passed away after  <br>01:13:51.840 that water addiction it was like a it  <br>01:13:53.360 was like a weight on my shoulders just  <br>01:13:54.560 to hear it  <br>01:13:55.639 so if your profession puts you right at  <br>01:13:58.120 the heart of this type of suffering how  <br>01:14:00.560 do  <br>01:14:01.880 you manage that to to hold that  <br>01:14:05.880 weight a couple things um first of all a  <br>01:14:09.080 lot of people get better and when people  <br>01:14:11.800 with addiction get better  <br>01:14:14.040 it's so much better that it's incredibly  <br>01:14:17.760 rewarding to see and they're amazing  <br>01:14:19.960 people Absolut like the most tenacious  <br>01:14:22.920 talented people you'll ever meet and  <br>01:14:25.239 when they get better it impacts so many  <br>01:14:28.320 other people right their friends their  <br>01:14:30.360 family the people they work with so it's  <br>01:14:33.280 very rewarding work and and not at all  <br>01:14:35.920 burdensome of course you know for  <br>01:14:38.120 patients who don't don't get better or  <br>01:14:41.040 patients who die it's a terrible feeling  <br>01:14:44.679 and there is a sense of um  <br>01:14:47.120 responsibility and and guilt even when I  <br>01:14:49.679 feel like there was nothing that I could  <br>01:14:51.080 have done otherwise um you know I carry  <br>01:14:53.880 those losses with me so it's hard is  <br>01:14:56.400 there any particular cases that have  <br>01:14:58.320 stayed with you the most I mean every  <br>01:15:00.920 patient I've had who's died while under  <br>01:15:03.639 my care those are incredibly painful um  <br>01:15:07.440 and I will never you know those are sort  <br>01:15:10.040 of a those people will be with me as a  <br>01:15:14.159 part of me for all of my life young and  <br>01:15:17.000 old yeah young and old yeah it's  <br>01:15:19.120 especially tragic to you to lose young  <br>01:15:21.560 people and it always feels like their  <br>01:15:24.520 second gu ing like oh if only I had done  <br>01:15:26.960 that or if only we had intervened here  <br>01:15:29.199 but I just think that's the nature of  <br>01:15:31.120 death we we can't get away from the  <br>01:15:33.239 feelings of guilt around it no matter  <br>01:15:35.239 who we are and no matter the  <br>01:15:37.280 circumstances how young can addiction  <br>01:15:40.800 and the consequences of  <br>01:15:42.560 addiction ruin someone's life like how  <br>01:15:44.920 young can someone be when their life is  <br>01:15:46.320 ruined from from the work you've done  <br>01:15:47.639 and the the patients you've worked with  <br>01:15:49.880 and what are those addictions typically  <br>01:15:51.600 that seem to be most um susceptible to  <br>01:15:54.400 those that are young  <br>01:15:56.800 well I mean you know some some kids  <br>01:15:59.800 start with drugs and alcohol you know  <br>01:16:03.199 five six seven eight five six yeah I  <br>01:16:06.199 mean it's you know some some some kids  <br>01:16:08.280 use with their parents or their  <br>01:16:09.920 caregivers they're exposed very early if  <br>01:16:13.199 we seriously conceptualize digital media  <br>01:16:16.239 as a drug I mean then we've got you know  <br>01:16:18.639 even younger cohorts starting with that  <br>01:16:20.800 and we do know that kids can get  <br>01:16:23.679 addicted to digital media  <br>01:16:25.840 and as a result um die from that I mean  <br>01:16:29.000 there was just this tragic case of a  <br>01:16:31.560 young man who essentially got addicted  <br>01:16:34.239 to a chat box I think he was 14 not my  <br>01:16:37.000 patient it was written up um in the New  <br>01:16:39.199 York Times in the Wall Street Journal  <br>01:16:41.560 and he fell in love with this chat box  <br>01:16:43.280 started to isolate wasn't spending time  <br>01:16:45.199 with his family or friends and then  <br>01:16:47.560 eventually took his own life purportedly  <br>01:16:50.000 so he could join this imaginary person  <br>01:16:55.880 what's the youngest patient you've ever  <br>01:16:57.239 seen the youngest I've seen is probably  <br>01:16:59.960 around 15 14 15 and they had an  <br>01:17:02.880 addiction yeah usually cannabis alcohol  <br>01:17:06.239 nicotine can you get addicted to  <br>01:17:07.960 cannabis oh yeah oh my gosh cannabis is  <br>01:17:12.080 very addictive really oh yeah  <br>01:17:15.880 yeah harmful very harmful the target  <br>01:17:19.639 organ that it damages the most is the  <br>01:17:22.040 brain um it's harmful in many ways I  <br>01:17:25.120 mean it number one it demotivates people  <br>01:17:29.480 often and so they can have the feeling  <br>01:17:32.679 that they're getting stuff done or that  <br>01:17:34.480 they're creative when in fact they're  <br>01:17:35.840 not doing  <br>01:17:37.400 anything um it most people smoke it and  <br>01:17:41.040 so it can be damaging to the lungs and  <br>01:17:43.199 and other other organs um a lot of  <br>01:17:46.199 people say that well cannabis isn't  <br>01:17:47.840 addictive because I don't have this  <br>01:17:49.920 standard withdrawal phenomenon when I  <br>01:17:51.719 stop like I don't have the shakes or  <br>01:17:53.360 anything like that but keep in mind the  <br>01:17:55.520 universal symptoms of addiction are  <br>01:17:57.760 psychological symptoms anxiety  <br>01:17:59.600 irritability depression insomnia craving  <br>01:18:02.520 and people have that in Spades when they  <br>01:18:04.440 try to stop using cannabis plus we often  <br>01:18:07.000 see something called the hyperemesis  <br>01:18:09.280 syndrome so cannabis can help with  <br>01:18:12.120 nausea and vomiting it can help decrease  <br>01:18:14.760 the feeling of wanting to vomit but  <br>01:18:18.239 again as the brain continues to be  <br>01:18:20.800 exposed to it there's this process of  <br>01:18:22.880 neuro adaptation it stops working and it  <br>01:18:25.440 can even turn on them and do the  <br>01:18:27.239 opposite So eventually people can  <br>01:18:29.440 actually have a cyclical vomiting  <br>01:18:31.480 syndrome as a result of cannabis so  <br>01:18:34.560 they'll show up in the emergency room  <br>01:18:35.639 and say I can't stop I can't stop  <br>01:18:37.199 vomiting and the reason is because of  <br>01:18:39.520 the Cannabis that they maybe initially  <br>01:18:41.600 started uh to stop feelings of  <br>01:18:45.440 nausea on page 40 of dopamine Nation you  <br>01:18:48.880 say we've lost the ability to tolerate  <br>01:18:50.719 even minor forms of discomfort yeah and  <br>01:18:52.800 as I was reading through this section of  <br>01:18:54.040 your book I was thinking it sounds like  <br>01:18:56.440 we've gone a little bit soft in society  <br>01:18:59.760 um we've reset our pleasure pain  <br>01:19:02.560 threshold to the side of pain that even  <br>01:19:04.800 the slightest thing feels like trauma to  <br>01:19:06.679 us even things that objectively speaking  <br>01:19:08.679 a generation or two ago would not have  <br>01:19:10.679 been considered traumatic are now trauma  <br>01:19:13.120 we live in a bit of a trauma Society uh  <br>01:19:15.280 one that doesn't appear to be very  <br>01:19:16.520 resilient and the only measure of that  <br>01:19:17.920 that I have is if I think about the work  <br>01:19:19.440 that my grandfather had to do versus the  <br>01:19:21.719 work that you know people maybe in my  <br>01:19:23.88|## SUMMARY  <br>Dr. Anna Lembke discusses addiction, dopamine's role in pleasure and pain, and strategies for achieving balance.  <br>  <br>## IDEAS:  <br>- Dopamine is essential for survival, motivating us to seek out rewards and pleasures.  <br>- The brain's pleasure and pain centers are interconnected, influencing addiction behaviors and choices.  <br>- Modern technology can hijack our reward systems, leading to increased vulnerability to addiction.  <br>- People often misidentify their discomfort and rationalize addictive behaviors as beneficial or necessary.  <br>- Exercise can boost dopamine levels without the typical addictive consequences associated with drugs.  <br>- Addiction often manifests in seemingly innocuous behaviors, such as compulsive reading or excessive work.  <br>- A significant portion of society engages in compulsive overconsumption, often without recognizing it as a problem.  <br>- The relationship between pain and pleasure is complex, with both being relative to one another.  <br>- Early exposure to addictive substances can lead to lifelong challenges with addiction.  <br>- Individuals may struggle to recognize the harm of their behaviors while actively engaging in them.  <br>- Substances like cannabis can be addictive and harmful, often leading to psychological issues.  <br>- Withdrawal symptoms from addiction can manifest as anxiety, irritability, and insomnia.  <br>- The pursuit of pleasure often overshadows the necessary discomfort that fosters growth and resilience.  <br>- Being present with discomfort can ultimately lead to greater emotional regulation and fulfillment.  <br>- Addiction is not limited to substances; behaviors can also become addictive and damaging.  <br>- The rise of technology has created new forms of addiction, particularly among younger generations.  <br>  <br>## INSIGHTS:  <br>- Recognizing the interplay between pleasure and pain is crucial for understanding addiction dynamics.  <br>- Acknowledging discomfort can provide a pathway to greater emotional resilience and awareness.  <br>- We must actively seek out challenges that encourage growth rather than succumb to avoidance.  <br>- Many addictive behaviors arise from the need to escape discomfort or seek immediate gratification.  <br>- The modern world often promotes instant pleasures, which can lead to chronic dissatisfaction.  <br>- Self-awareness is vital for identifying harmful behaviors masquerading as harmless activities.  <br>- Finding balance in today's pleasure-rich environment requires intentional effort and mindfulness.  <br>- Awareness of personal triggers can help mitigate the risk of falling into addictive patterns.  <br>- Understanding that addiction can stem from various sources, not just trauma, broadens our perspective.  <br>- Acknowledging the societal pressures and norms around productivity can help combat work addiction.  <br>  <br>## QUOTES:  <br>- "Dopamine is fundamental to our survival."  <br>- "The same parts of the brain that process pleasure also process pain."  <br>- "We automatically seek out pleasure and avoid pain."  <br>- "Alcohol works through its own chemical pathway."  <br>- "We're all wired to be addicted."  <br>- "One hit of a meth pipe is equal to 10 orgasms."  <br>- "We've lost the ability to tolerate even minor forms of discomfort."  <br>- "Digital media lights up the same reward pathway as drugs and alcohol."  <br>- "People can get addicted to behaviors too."  <br>- "The brain adapts by down regulating dopamine transmission."  <br>- "Every time we do something pleasurable, dopamine affects our behavior."  <br>- "The balance wants to remain level."  <br>- "It’s okay to be unhappy or restless."  <br>- "Addiction is the continued compulsive use of a substance despite harm."  <br>- "If we continue to consume our drug of choice, we enter an addicted brain."  <br>- "Exercise can help restore homeostasis and positively affect dopamine levels."  <br>  <br>## HABITS:  <br>- Engage in physical activities like exercise to boost dopamine naturally and combat cravings.  <br>- Practice mindfulness to remain present, reducing the urge to escape discomfort.  <br>- Limit exposure to digital media to help reset your reward system and reduce addiction risk.  <br>- Set boundaries around work to prevent excessive consumption and burnout.  <br>- Implement a regular sleep schedule to maintain emotional regulation and mental clarity.  <br>- Explore hobbies that require effort and investment, promoting satisfaction over instant gratification.  <br>- Take periodic breaks from addictive behaviors to assess their impact on your well-being.  <br>- Engage in social activities that foster genuine connections, counteracting feelings of loneliness.  <br>- Maintain a balanced diet to support overall brain health and dopamine production.  <br>- Reflect on personal triggers and develop strategies to mitigate their impact on behaviors.  <br>  <br>## FACTS:  <br>- Dopamine release is significantly increased by addictive substances compared to natural rewards.  <br>- The average life of a business has decreased from 50 years to around 15 years.  <br>- Participation in ultramarathons increased by 1,676% between 1996 to 2008.  <br>- Cannabis can lead to psychological symptoms similar to those of other addictive substances.  <br>- The human brain can experience a dopamine deficit state even after stopping substance use.  <br>- Withdrawal from addictive substances can cause universal symptoms like anxiety and depression.  <br>- Digital media can be as addictive as traditional substances, affecting younger generations particularly.  <br>- Many people are unaware of their compulsive overconsumption behaviors and their consequences.  <br>- The relationship between pleasure and pain is fundamental to understanding addiction in modern life.  <br>- Addictive behaviors can stem from a variety of sources, not just childhood trauma.  <br>  <br>## REFERENCES:

There's a lot of people I see asleep on this They're They're asleep on this Chuck They're not paying attention Do you think the roles we have now with like IT engineers network engineers will exist in 5 years um I have a question that's kind of been keeping me up at night Is there a future for network engineers in the age of AI like in 5 years are we going to exist that's why I'm here at Cisco Live the largest networking conference in the entire world And I'm asking this question I need the answer I'm asking Cisco people I'm asking network engineers who come here 22,000 of them hey what do you think about AI are you worried do you currently use AI is this a thing for you and let me tell you this year feels different for network engineers Everywhere you step everywhere you look AI AI AI The opening keynote Chuck Robbins AI G2 Patel AI Everything is AI So here we go Let's dive in Okay First walking up to Cisco Live the conference center AI everywhere Every sign every advertisement it's the AI era We're powering AI Every booth in the world of solutions had something to say about AI We kind of have a reason to be a little bit worried about AI In fact I just saw a Reddit post today where someone who had just gone to Cisco Live they're like "Huh are we going to be okay?" It's a very question I'm trying to answer dayto-day And by the way this video is sponsored by Cisco They brought me out to Cisco Live and they gave me the freedom to make whatever I wanted Thank you Cisco team You are amazing Now my first mission was to figure out how people feel about AI Are they optimistic are they scared um I can tell you that I touch AI almost daily for almost everything I do for work So AI how do you feel about it are you optimistic are you excited are you all in you get all in or you get all out How do you feel about AI oh I love AI I use it almost every day So really okay So you're optimistic about it oh yeah I think it's the future I mean everything's going to have AI in it going forward And if you don't learn it now you're going to get left behind So I'm optimistic Great I know AI has been around but in a different form than what we're used to right now right so AI now I think it'll actually enhance all of our experiences Right I'm optimistic about it I've used it for both college and personal like creating experience So you use AI now yep Um I know my colleague here is not so keen on it really I'm indifferent I mean I think it's neat for security and like medical stuff but right all the GPT and all that stuff It's neat but I don't care Now overall people seem to be pretty excited about AI They're optimistic They think that AI is going to make their lives better because it already has And I know for me it has in some ways and the more models that come out and the the better I understand how to use it it does actually help me with some things but not everything We'll get to that later Then I wanted to see okay network engineers IT people how are they actually using AI are they using it with their jobs and not just with their everyday life stuff with AI are you using it right now in your job i am How are you using it mostly for uh code ciloting and stuff that I don't want to do We actually just started about a year ago and we're actually going heavy into AI We're a utility company right so we're finding ways whereby AI could help us automate a lot of stuff that's you know done manually right now So I mean we talk we talk about about this all the time Um AI is an assistant to what you do And so you are the gatekeeper of what you allow AI to do or not do to your infrastructure Um we I think it's encouraged today to leverage that assistant next to you I know you and I when we talked first talked about automation back what five six years ago uh we were starting the whole DevNet thing and we talked about okay so is automation going to change the way I manage my network and is it going to take my job and and and and here we are we're just talking about automation as a skill as something that you should adopt as part of your tool set when you're working with your network AI is the same um my company we're we're trying to use AI where we can um I You don't want to rely completely on AI but it's a great starting point I mean I'll give you for instance I had to write a document uh really an ITIL document on that So okay I go to co-pilot C-pilot write me a document based based on ITIL you know give me a policy document So it gives me a policy document Okay make these changes making these changes gets me like 60% of the way there in minutes At that point now I can take it and do my own thing I wouldn't take that document and put it forward and said "Here's my document." Right Right Don't do that but it's 60s something percent of the way there and now it's a really easy way to say okay where do I go from there rather than sitting at a blank page and going what do I AI is just another tool um and I've been talking this week a lot about ways that network engineers can use AI today to make themselves better engineers so an example I I I will sometimes go into is you're you know you've got some piece of knowledge buried deep in the back of your head but it's buried under dust and cobwebs and too many late nights with pizza um you could go try to dive through it or go into it But I like asking AI cuz I know if I see the right answer I was like "Yeah that's the right answer I can dive in." So verification of information great use case for it Now speaking of using AI one of my first interviews I actually had was sitting down with John Capo Biano This guy is a ball of energy I love him Thank you for sitting down with me John He's a former Cisco employee but now he has left and he's working for an AI company called Selector AI I wanted to sit down with John because he's kind of at the forefront of networking with AI on Twitter He's the first guy I see messing with MCP agent to agent agent ops all those buzzwords And I asked him the same question Are you optimistic about AI why do you think it was that you were more excited versus like we're doomed well I see it as um like the computer is for human convenience Now I'm old I'm very old My first computer didn't come with a mouse Oh The mouse was a peripheral that was screwed into the back on a serial port And now I could move the mouse around Okay I know it sounds hilariously trivial and I'm really old but it's about convenience is it not mhm So now instead of menus and gooies and clicking and memorizing commands and I can use my own natural intuition and just sus out questions in a conversational way Now should we be frightened uh I think we should be a little frightened right there's with the great power comes the great responsibility but it's an opportunity Chuck I see this like like the protocols we just talked about MCP and ADA Why they've got me so excited is because they're protocols like HTTP or SMTP or spanning tree protocols Your code can work with my code because we're developing them with standards It's not the wild west anymore Right And it's very much like the late 90s mid 90s where protocols suddenly changed the world Right Right Think about HTTP hypertext transfer protocol and HTML What did that do for the world right it brought us online Yeah it did Yeah So now these new MCP tools are going to bring us even further with artificial intelligence So you're overall optimistic i'm optimistic I'm optimistic So of course obviously John works for an AI company He's pretty optimistic But I loved one of the last conversations I had with Hank Preston Now hint Preston if you don't know who he is he when I first met him he was the Python network automation guy back in 2018209 a big shift in networking was happening we as network engineers and admins were being told that we have to become developers in fact Susie we got to the stage and said hey you guys are developers now and that kind of scared a lot of network engineers including myself like are we going away is our job going away guess what it But Hank was at the forefront of that He had an amazing session that everyone flocked to He was like the guy those years and he was showing us how to start using network automation and Python with network automation This is a key thing I want you to remember We're going to touch on that later But one of the last things that Hank said to me and Jeremy as we were talking to him was that he said "You have to be optimistic about AI What else are you going to do?" And that's I kind of feel like where everyone is We're choosing to be optimistic you have to to wake up in the morning and continue on with this network engineering journey Now do we have a reason to be optimistic that's still what I'm trying to figure out The next thing I wanted to know is are these people worried so they may be optimistic about AI but are they worried about network engineering are they worried about their own jobs no I think the role is changing Back then networks were not what they I mean licensing what isn't what it is today So so you look at how networks has progressed since then It's the same thing I I think a network engineer that's saying like well I just you know I I build switches I plug that's not an engineer it's a jockey um that whole that whole job has changed over the years Yeah So now you think about like you know you look at catalyst center you can deploy switches very quickly So using uh using the tools in catalyst center to deploy how many switches right away Yeah that's true So so the job itself has changed and I think everyone understands that and they need to you know learn the new stuff and and move forward with that So one thing about AI is yes there might be job loss but also creates opportunity for you to learn new stuff and you know remain relevant So I'm not worried about that at all I actually embrace it I think it's going to be overall net good for everybody Yeah you know do you what's your take on AI as far as the job market goes do you think it's kind of scary like we're going to start losing jobs or what do you think i would say like 25% jobs of the current form will go away New jobs have come but it will not like gap all the beaches bridges but it will come different things So like as a current technology like here the tech expert I would say like people try to get familiar with it like the way we get oursel familiar with apps smartphones we should get familiar with it and get on top of it and take it like another cuisine right you are just trying out another cuisine just don't be afraid of it right so I don't think that networking as a career is going to diminish I think it's going to become more and more specialized more and more specialized to support you know high performance computing or GPUs or large language models in the data center Um I think we still have 3 to 5 years of a safety net I don't think that it's going to be that revolutionary and that fast Beyond 3 to 5 years it's really hard to project or predict I think the time for skepticism is behind us I think that everyone who is using AI has an advantage over people who are not using AI Okay Right And as we have this conversation if you're not using AI there are people are there are other people using it right and there's going to be a parody gap here And that is what I'm worried about are the people here that aren't using it that aren't paying attention that are going to wake up one day to a whole new reality that they're not prepared for Um at least today and and it some of this certainly will change as AI models get better Um but right now AI is not truly creative AI are mathematical models that are building on patterns and finding patterns that are there and giving you good information and it's fantastic at that And so one of the things that I think true humans are still necessary is for innovative ideas Um I'm also I try to be optimistic right the world is not for machines The world is for people and I think that we will recognize that there is still value in having people involved in the work not just the machines that are there Again optimism They think network engineering is going to be okay Many saying that network engineering will become even more critical as AI becomes more prevalent More data centers means more network engineers making those data centers work I like that viewpoint So I don't know about you but at this point I'm feeling pretty good I've talked to people at Cisco I've talked to engineers I've talked to engineers who love using AI and they're all feeling pretty good about it for now And that was my next question because right now AI is moving at a pace I can't keep up with Can you keep up with it it seems like every single week in fact just this week and I haven't looked at it yet or even played with it we had a new model 03 Pro come out So my question was in 5 years is the job of network engineer going to exist or system engineer IT engineer because in 5 years a lot can change I think they're going to change They've been changing Uh I think you're still going to have network engineers uh obviously still have managers like myself but uh you know the roles are going to be there but they're going to change because we have to change with the times you know uh you look at uh you look at cyber security you look at uh all the problems that are out there the bad guys are also using AI so they're getting quicker so we have to worry about that as well it it it's going to be different for sure yeah what's like uniquely human that you can do just that kind of thinking what's uniquely engineer right so you know you can't build a network unless you actually understand how networks network right right I mean we all know we've all seen networks where you're looking at that and like you're like who built that do do you understand it was AI AI built it Yeah You know so you know there will always be the need to be able to have a deeper understanding of how the network works Do you think the role of network engineer as we know it right now will that exist in 5 years it will We should be running the bots Oh definitely especially network engineers you know AI runs on the network so you're going to have to have the network there So I just see it making us uh more efficient you know if anything we're but we're never going to go away We're here to stay It's more of AI actually assisting actually seeing more visibility of the network and what's going on and give us more instead of working you know 12 16 18 hour days it actually allow us to work eight hour days Do you guys think that there will be a future for networking do you think the AI will take over networking uh I don't think so As it like I said as it currently stands now Definitely not In the future it's possible I think it's it's somewhere in the middle I think the the mundane tasks that we uh do daytoday are going to go away which means I don't need to SSH into a box I don't need to look at what's going on with my network that way I'm going to probably have an agent that do that for me But we talked about this like automation whether before AI you were supposed to do that anyway right with automation um do I think it's going to we're still going to touch the CLI I think at some level we will um it's going to probably be augmented with AI built into the terminal which I think it's out there today where you have your CLI you have an agent on your terminal that's helping you with commands I don't I don't know most of the iOS XC commands and I can't tell you how many times I go out to Cisco Docs or I go out to Google to search for it Now it's there So it's going to speed up It's going to it's going to make make me have superpowers um as a network engineer but I don't think it's going to make me obsolete I think that network engineer looks similar to the one that is today but they've in uh incorporated uh more security skills because again there's not a company I know of that wants an insecure network And and I I would also say someone that understands it not just from a network security standpoint but a cyber security standpoint understands red teaming understands pen testing understands blue teaming skills like incident response and threat hunting I also think that that's someone that natively understands automation I I I think that you know everybody thinks about AI almost like it's an easy button It's not If you really want to get the benefits of AI if you really want to feel them in your network you have to you have to automate more of your network uh operations and activities and that's going to be a big part of I think any uh CCNA CCNP CCIE engineer and what they're doing They're going to be thinking about how they can really drive that automation to get the benefits of AI Otherwise when I hear of people talk about oh it's all hype It's all hype until you really automate that network activity and I think that that's going to be a big part of the future work that our engineers are going to be doing Now this question I feel like had the most fun answers It became more practical for me For example Clark he said "We'll have 8 hour days instead of these 16-hour days that network engineers are normally faced with Waking up and and getting those calls Maybe AI removes being on call Wouldn't that be amazing?" Karine said that AI is going to give us superpowers It will augment us and make us better It'll do the things that we don't want to do And Josh reiterated that AI runs on the network The network powers it The more AI there is the more AI needs us Now my take on that I think it's optimistic and we have to be optimistic It's really hard to say what's going to happen in 5 years If we're honest with ourselves we will all say that we were all surprised where AI is at this present moment No one saw this coming I feel like we're going to be saying something very similar in five years And then I asked one more fun question It was a meme I saw on X or Twitter I don't know what to call it What do you call it still which side of the bus are you on and this assumes the premise that AI will eventually take half of all jobs Will you be on the left side where you're saddened by the idea of AI taking jobs you don't want it to happen You think people should be the ones working Or are you on the right side of the bus will you be overjoyed by the idea that AI takes jobs maybe we enter a postj job world Sure there's problems to solve Oh a lot more problems to solve with that scenario Where do you sit uh I'm the girl standing in the middle going it could do that and it could do that My jury's still out if you'll pardon the pun I'm somewhere in the middle Somewhere in the middle Okay Lots of jobs be happy to hand off to AI I'm on the AI's going to take all our jobs right okay And I'm and I am an outlier right like I I have my own unique uh take on this but it is it to me it being AI and large language models and natural language and chatting with the computer It it is like the promise of the last 30 40 years I feel like we've been on this trajectory and we're sort of reaching the operand of Mo's law and some of these right we're really starting to maximize our compute power and I I again I believe in a utopian outcome now whether or not we it's going to cost a lot of jobs I think that as yes some jobs will be displaced but you know two years ago there wasn't such a thing as a machine learning engineer right so new emerging categories of jobs will will come out Uh I would say for me somewhere in the middle um maybe towards the the left a little bit where is it is AI going to destroy half of all the jobs i don't think so And I I I want to say this and this is something that we we we overlook often which is humans engineers um network engineers have this thing that AI doesn't have which is critical thinking and so you built your critical thinking uh skills from learning from uh troubleshooting networks from experience right that AI does does not have the capability to do that critical thinking skills Now I think I'm somewhere in the middle as well There are jobs in history that don't exist anymore and should not exist Like lamplighters That was a popular example that the CEO of Anthropic used when he was talking about "Hey wake up Jobs might be taken In 2 to 3 years we might see 50% of jobs gone." But also I think that we need to work People need to work People need purpose We should never remove people from these jobs AI should always be there to help us but never replace us And that's a common theme I heard many many times throughout talking with everyone in all these interviews is that AI isn't going to replace you but someone using AI will But then John Capo Biano and he comes in with the craziest notion and many people do hold this view He was fully on the right side of the bus And then the keynote happened The opening keynote at Cisco Live is where they announced all the crazy stuff they're doing And shocker they talked about AI a lot Chuck Robbins opened with saying that the AI race is on We have to move forward We have to be quick because everyone is trying to have the best AI We have to make it secure We have to make it the best We all know that every company every organization every government around the world There's also a defensive mechanism There's a FOMO element about what are you doing in AI and I agree There's no stopping it The only thing we can do now is sprint forward as fast as we can I get that And then G2 Patel took the stage One thing he said stood out to me With the help of agents or AI we can take the 8 billion people in the world and augment them in a way to where we have a throughput a workforce throughput of 80 billion people So 8 billion humans will feel like we have the throughput capacity of 80 billion humans He then went on to say that we're going to have a different looking workforce We'll have humans of course maybe but we'll also have AI agents AI apps robotics and humanoids That's terrifying but it's going to happen And then they announced something pretty cool and also pretty terrifying They announced their own purpose-built AI model for networking It's called the deep network model It's been trained on a ton of networking related data and tasks And similar to how they benchmark other AI LLMs on coding task this one they gave it a CCIE test labs and exam and it performed 20% better than the other leading LLM models They actually announced something similar at RSA conference but it was security focused I think it was called the security foundation model I did try it out It was okay But then Cisco showed us something pretty crazy They're putting AI in the data center and they're doing it with a thing called AI canvas It's a new control panel that's all about AI it's AI first and they gave a demo in which this guy was troubleshooting a connectivity error and this demo was live real time and he simply just chatted with this interface which I believe was the deep network model and it started doing things that man humans just can't do It's multimodal so it was generating graphs and charts about the network in real time Graphs and charts that we could drag on over to the main canvas real time dashboard creation which honestly is amazing But then they showed one more terrifying thing They had the model figure out a configuration like produce a QoS policy or a cost policy for me quality of service and then he asked it to apply this policy So at this point this is something a network engineer would have done We would have gotten into the routers the switches wherever this QoS policy would need to be applied We would have troubleshooted it figured out the configuration and applied it The AI did this for the guy operating this I forgot his name And all he had to do was just tell it his intent What do you wanted to happen in regular human language not CLI speak like we spend so long learning when we're studying for the CCNA and CCMP which brought me to a conversation I had with Kareem Escander and Joe Clark Kareem is part of the team that actually brought me out to Cisco Thank you Kareem How do you teach them to use AI and then make sure they're using it right how do you have a CCNA exam that's measuring if they're using AI effectively along with troubleshooting a network one of the ways we we think we can do this well first of all we might have to reconsider how we evaluate exams So in the real world you would have Google you would have chat GPT Instead of doing a lot of multiple choice memorization like you just said imagine if your exam allows you access to an LLM allows you access to a search and instead of multiple choice you're dropped onto a web portal for Moroi or you're dropped into a CLI and you actually when it says configure when it says implement you have to configure you have to implement The second part of your question is towards how do you get them to think critically about what AI is coming back with We think there's an opportunity to present them with um artifacts like this is the topology diagram of the network These are the configurations of the network This is the prompt and this is what the LLM said What do you think is the right answer what do you think is the most accurate response the AI has given you and if they've studied if they've prepared if they've played with some of that LLM with something like Cisco modeling labs in a simulated environment they should be able to answer that They should be able to say "Ah you can't do that interface there." Or it says "We're not allowed to run this protocol in our network so I can't trust that answer It has to be this answer." So what we're seeing right now is people say "You need to learn AI You still need to learn the CCNA but you need to learn all the new tools." A big focus that Joe mentioned was learning how to interpret the results of an AI So when you're talking with an LLM and being able to see if it's giving you bad data or it's hallucinating Okay so let's close this up I came to Cisco Live to figure out is there a future for network engineers this year We had an attendance of 22,000 people 22,000 people that care about networking that were there to learn about networking to kind of get a forecast for the future What are we supposed to be learning the overall take of many people I talked with was they're optimistic They're using AI every day in their job and they're actually excited about how it's going to make their lives easier their jobs easier Some are honest and saying "Yeah it might take away some jobs but it won't take away the jobs of people who adapt who learn and use AI in their current roles." Now I know in many roles I've had we've been understaffed We needed more people but we couldn't find them So I totally understand the appeal of having an AI buddy to augment your staff I just hope it doesn't go too far to where they realize suddenly they don't need me either But I will say this I was so encouraged being at this conference because what I saw was still a strong desire to learn networking People are still tons of people are still going for their CCNA their CCMP Everyone's excited about learning that next new thing and they're also excited about learning the basics IP addressing subnetting OPF EIGRP For the time being no matter how good AI gets we need people who know those protocols so we can tell AI when it's being dumb But reality check real change is coming and we need to be ready to adapt You need to adapt now If you haven't already started playing with AI you need to become very familiar with it I think the best thing you can do for yourself right now is just ask yourself how can AI help me do my current job better also get in community Talk with your fellow engineers and see what they're doing But also take comfort in this This is no different than anything we've ever encountered in it We've always had to learn and adapt to the new technologies that come up The people who don't adapt they do get left behind We had traditional telefan migrate to voiceover IP We saw the big change with network automation going from manually configuring a switch a switch a switch with CLI to configuring thousands all at once with automation One might say that AI is simply another iteration the next generation of automation And as far as what network engineers will be doing in the future I think that's probably it It will not be getting in the weeds as much as we are right now dealing with outages and and looking through logs It'll be how can I make the network better how can I automate more of the stuff we already have and in 5 years who knows you can't know Be optimistic Keep studying And from what we can see the world needs network engineers And we have a shortage and more AI is being built and we got to help power it Now I want to know what you think The questions I asked I would love to have those put in the comments below That's all I got I'll catch you guys next|### SUMMARY  <br>Presenter discusses the future of network engineering amidst

Yeah i was like "I want the**4:25**McDonald's like I want a Happy Meal." And now I mean obviously I am so beyond grateful i went to college um I started**4:33**eating fast food and I don't even recognize who that person is anymore but you know I was eating in the dining hall**4:38**which is you know Cisco and Shamrock Foods catering and and I I gained a bunch of weight i got acne I'd never had**4:44**before i was fatigued and I it wasn't until I took a nutrition course and also**4:49**my mom had sent me a book on nutrition and it was literally just called you are what you eat wow and cuz I was looking**4:55**for answers right but I was looking in all the wrong places i was eating Slim Fast bars for breakfast and thinking**5:00**that I was going to lose weight and like get healthy which is so ironic right and I found this book it's called You Are**5:06**What You Eat and it really just it was talk about a light bulb moment for me it made me really understand oh wow the**5:12**things that I'm putting in my body the food that I'm eating is quite literally building my cells and it's going to either determine whether I have good**5:18**energy and I'm going to be at a healthy weight and I'm not going to you know be inflamed all the time or it's going to drive all of that right and it's so**5:25**funny looking back to that now thinking how much of a light bulb moment that was for me but it really lit a fire under my**5:30**ass because I quite to be quite frank I was pretty mad that I had not learned that sooner because I was uh probably 20**5:37**at that point and you were in college and I was thinking why aren't we teaching small children this why doesn't**5:42**every human know this and I was also thinking too looking at all my um you know my my parents' friends and like**5:47**older generations and a lot of them still hadn't figured it out and I was so flabbergasted for lack of a better word**5:54**because I was like this is so simple right it's so simple um the things that we're eating and we're putting in our bodies are either fighting disease or**6:02**fueling it you know and so that really ignited a passion in me and then I just**6:07**could not get enough information I found Michael Pollen back then when he was writing about food um I found Dr mark**6:14**Heyman i think I read one of his very first books love him yeah and he introduced me to this world of**6:19**functional and integrative medicine which is you know root cause disease protocol um where you're looking at the**6:25**root cause and you're looking for the root cause and trying to u mitigate symptoms with diet and lifestyle changes so that really affected me a lot i was**6:31**in school or sorry I was actually touring at the time um I finally decided in the music industry exactly so I was**6:37**with the music industry um I decided to quit that and I went back and I got my masters of science in nutrition and**6:44**integrative health wow and then actually during that time I got pulled back on the road and I ended up being a**6:50**nutritionist for four years for a pop star really yeah which was pretty amazing so cool and it was very cool**6:55**because it was you know I got to kind of blend both of my favorite worlds which was nutrition and then being on tour and and getting to work for musicians which**7:02**was so much fun but I did hit a point where um you know we kind of talked about this on my podcast that it was**7:07**really starting to to really like tax my body like I just was feeling the effects of not getting enough sleep and you know**7:14**it is harder to eat healthy and so I finally in 2019 decided to no longer tour anymore and I had been building**7:20**real foodology on the side and at the time it really was more just of a hobby i really had no plan i had no like goals**7:27**or plans of turning this into anything other than it started with a passion where I felt like this was information**7:33**that people largely didn't know and I was seeing so many people suffer and like you just said a minute ago I want**7:38**to see people thrive and so I started Real Food as a blog and I was just kind of Instagramming my my touring life and**7:45**then in 2019 I was like you know what i'm going to pursue this full-time started my podcast in 2020 wow 2020**7:51**that's that's awesome yeah yeah and then it just kind of has exploded from there that's so great you know I I think too**7:58**that you know sometimes when we travel we realize that you know you go to Italy and you have a bowl of pasta and a**8:04**basket of bread maybe a glass of wine and you feel amazing um in fact some**8:09**people will travel to European countries and lose weight even though eating high carbohydrates pizza pasta yeah I**8:15**remember when the the research came out on the blue zones and I was I was**8:21**watching the documentary on the blue zones and I was reading the book on it and I read Dr walter Longo's book on the**8:26**longevity diet and I realized you know there's there's no continuity between**8:32**diets that are helping people live to be hypercentinarians meaning it wasn't**8:37**carnivore keto paleo pescatarian vegan vegetarian it wasn't the hyperd dogmatic diets it was just whole food yes like**8:45**just real food yes and you know in the States a lot of our food is just not**8:51**even food and and I wonder if we could talk about that for a minute because without sounding like fearmongers you**8:58**know a part of what I believe our industry and people like yourself are trying to do is just help people get**9:03**around the system and and just get to back to the basics almost right i mean I**9:11**feel like if most people just got sunlight touched the surface of the earth focused on their sleep hydrated**9:17**some minerals ate old foods I mean just those basics would have a such a**9:23**dramatic impact on on on their life and so I know that you're very connected to**9:28**and enormous supporter of the of the Maha movement we talked a little bit about it on on your podcast i wonder if**9:35**we might just delve into some of the the sinister things that have gone on for**9:40**decades um that are really leading to this chronic disease epidemic that we**9:46**have and the reason why the majority of people are just walking around probably**9:52**60% of their true state of normal and just believing that this is a consequence of aging**9:58**so that is one of the biggest myths in in all of this in the nutrition wellness  <br>**Biggest Myth in Nutrition and Wellness10:04**and medical system that really drives me nuts is that people just think "Oh that's this is just what happens you**10:09**start aging and then you don't feel that well and your energy plummets and then you know you maybe have to go on a couple med medications and maybe you get**10:16**diabetes oh that's just aging i hear that all the time it's just oh well it's just part of being human that does not**10:22**have to be your experience yeah and I think it's normalized not to cut you off but I think it's normalized too because at certain ages your whole peer group is**10:29**experiencing the same thing they're like "Yeah well none of us really sleep well and we don't remember anything i can't find my car keys and my belt and my**10:35**wallet." And and they're like "Oh it's normal." Because all my friends are doing the same thing spare tire that I I never really had but all my friends do**10:41**and and I'm on three meds but all of my buddies are on three meds and my wife's on three or four meds yes and I and I**10:48**think that normalization almost makes it feel like it's just a part of quote unquote what**10:54**happens but exactly but just because it's happening to a lot of people and it's becoming normalized does not mean**11:00**that it's okay and that it should be happening i agree and Yeah and you know a lot of this is**11:06**largely driven by the fact that we are for the most part not really eating food anymore 60% of Americans d Americans**11:13**diets are coming from ultrarocessed foods 60% that's more than half of our diet what does it mean to be**11:18**ultrarocessed i think a lot of people don't understand what that means i mean does that mean that we just take a cow**11:24**and slaughter it and chop it into steaks and package it and send it or No so that would be processing yeah so there's a**11:30**there's a lot of discrepancy between like processing versus ultrarocessed because I see some of these like RDS or**11:35**dissenting voices out there that are saying "Oh well uh applesauce is processed bread is processed." So that**11:41**is absolutely true but there is a huge difference between eating applesauce that maybe is just made with apple and**11:47**maybe add a little bit of sugar and some water versus if you were going to go to McDonald's and get an apple pie so the**11:52**difference between ultrarocessed and just something simply processing that we've been doing since the dawn of time**11:57**is with ultrarocessed foods you're adding a ton of additives and preservatives and fillers in there and that food no longer resembles what that**12:05**natural state of food once was i I often I often tell people if your grandparents**12:11**were to time travel or maybe like your great-grandparents like someone who's no longer alive if they were to time travel and you just dropped them into 2025 and**12:17**you took them to a grocery store and you showed them all these food products that were eating oh my god they probably wouldn't even know what where it came**12:23**from like they wouldn't even tell be able to tell you just by looking at it like "Oh I know that that is from potatoes." They would be like "What what**12:29**is that?" Right that would be something that would be ultrarocessed foods soldier processed foods are made with a**12:35**bunch of ingredients that you would not normally have in your kitchen they're a bunch of ingredients that you find in factories and my argument and the whole**12:42**reason that I started real foodology my whole thing was when I came up with that name 14 years ago is I sat down and I**12:47**thought what's going to stand the test of time when it comes to nutrition and health we always need to be coming back**12:52**to eating real food that's so true and that has been the basis of my entire business and my message is that we need**12:59**to be getting back to eating real food and right now more than or the majority of our calories are coming from these**13:07**ultrarocessed foods you know what's amazing is I I still remember going into my um grandmother's basement Grandma  <br>**The Shift in Eating Real Foods to Ultra-Processed Foods13:13**Rose who I named my daughter after um so my grandmother um Rose Brea she in her**13:19**basement which was always like a little cool were all these like canned vegetables everywhere and she would she would every year you know she would can**13:25**vegetables and she would make like sauerkrauts and kimchi and pickles and all of this stuff i always thought it was like a little weird um but I I**13:33**really identify with it now and I remember you used to press the lid and if the if the lid was still tight she was like "Yeah bring it upstairs if the**13:39**lid pops throw it in the trash." Yes and um I still remember I'm like "This is so weird." Because I was here last**13:46**Christmas and that pickle was right there you know so something tells me I shouldn't bring this up and eat it um**13:53**but it made so much sense they didn't have preservatives and they didn't have**13:58**the you know um thickening agents and all a lot of these artificial ingredients and so they preserved them**14:04**naturally through the fermentation process which actually made them more healthy and you know like fermented**14:09**vegetables one of the healthiest things you can put in your body i try to eat a lot of kimchi and sauerkraut and get the**14:15**soluble and insoluble fibers um but you know I think we've we've modernized things and I don't think that we got**14:23**here overnight i think we got here really slowly and I think we just**14:28**ignored the problem until we are at call it pandemic levels crisis levels**14:34**whatever you want to call it i mean we are at the point where I think from a financial**14:40**perspective that you know the the cost of healthcare could break the entire system oh yeah right um I don't think**14:46**people understand how detrimental it is actually I don't think so either i wonder if you might talk about that a little bit and I want to go into some of**14:52**the chemicals specifically like glyphosate you know we hear about these things um but we don't really know how**14:58**do they get into our food supply why are they in our food supply um is there some kind of sinister profit motive behind it**15:04**and if so like you know what can we do to to address it yeah so I largely believe that most of this stuff started**15:10**with good intention the problem is is that now that we have the data and the science and we know that these chemicals  <br>**Chemicals in Our Food Supply15:17**and certain processing you know things that we're doing with our food we now know that they are harming people and**15:23**now it is to the point where it is becoming sinister in my opinion but I don't think it started out that way largely a lot of what we're dealing with**15:29**now which is an industrialization of our food system was started because of the war you know after the war um there was**15:35**famine people or our president was genuinely concerned about getting enough food to people having it be cheap**15:40**accessible fast so that's when we started paying subsidies to farmers because they thought okay what crops can**15:46**we grow just rows and rows and rows of grow them really fast and then commodit**15:52**commodi commoditize them commoditize commoditize them why was that so hard for me to get out you actually said a**15:57**word on the podcast last time that was the first time I'd ever heard it i needed to go infantilize maybe infantilize that was the word i almost I**16:06**almost fact checked you on that because I was like I've never heard of it but the context I got it so it is really a**16:13**word it is well I say you regardless and lots of other things that are not words but that's that's really good it's rare**16:19**that I hear a word and I'm like "Wow that's a new one." It's fun i've been I've been trying to to broaden my You're**16:25**going to hear it start popping into my podcast right i hope I use it well be like "Oh Gary got that from me." Not to**16:32**infantilize you but But if you want protein to build lean**16:37**muscle but without the caloric impact or need to cut you need perfect amino it's pure essential amino acids the building**16:44**blocks of proteins in a precise form and ratio that allows for near 100%**16:50**utilization in building lean muscle and no caloric impact so we build protein**16:55**six times as much as whey but without the excess body fat we normally get during bulking this is the new era of**17:02**protein supplementation and it's real if you want to build lean muscle without having to cut you need perfect amino**17:09**when it comes to snacking Masa is flipping the script on what real food should look like masa chips are crafted**17:15**with grass-fed beef tallow one of the healthiest fats on the planet these chips are packed with essential vitamins**17:21**like vitamin A D E and vitamin K2 all of which play a role in keeping your skin**17:26**vibrant your immune system strong and your bones solid but here's the real magic about Masa masa's corn goes**17:33**through an ancient process called nyx stimilization which makes it way easier to digest and it amps up its nutrient**17:39**profile plus these chips are low in pufas so you won't find any of the inflammatory seed oils that you find in**17:45**most snacks and instead masa uses pure Redmond sea salt giving you a natural**17:50**hit of minerals that keep your cells hydrated and your energy steady so don't just snack reach for Masa it's real food**17:57**real health without any of the junk grab a bag and I promise you'll feel the difference now let's get back to the**18:03**Ultimate Human podcast so historically you think that you know obviously after the war we needed to promulleate crops**18:09**and we need to have them less expensive and more readily available and there was also this notion which we're still**18:15**seeing today is that they wanted to feed the world so this is when we started introducing things like glyphosate for**18:20**example which is one that I really am hyperfocused on right now i'm incredibly concerned about glyphosate um over 90%**18:27**of Americans were finding glyphosate in their urine and it's coming up in placenta it's coming up in breast milk i**18:32**had it in my my urine i did the vibrant wellness test yeah even those of us that are eating organic and we're doing**18:38**really hard and we're doing saunas and we're detoxing we are all finding it in our blood and it is so incredibly concerning so glyphosate is an herbicide**18:45**um it's also known as Roundup which was created by Monsanto now in 2018 Bayer**18:51**which is a pharmaceutical company bought Monsanto and now they are also a agrochemical company and they own a**18:57**majority of our food system now because they have patented genetically modified seeds which are corn um wheat and or**19:04**sorry we just started genetically modifying wheat recently but corn and soy are the majority of those now during**19:09**the war what we did is we started paying subsidies to farmers what are subsidies these come from taxpayer dollars and**19:15**it's money that we give to farmers in order to incentivize them to grow specific crops wow now some of the crops**19:20**that we do with that are corn and soy now it's why I would encourage everybody**19:25**listening if you have any ultrarocessed foods in your cabinet I would go and I would read the label and I would argue**19:31**that almost every single one of them that you pick up it's going to say may contain corn wheat and soy really**19:36**they're in everything because we are paying farmers to grow them so we have them in surplus and it's cheaper it's**19:44**more accessible um it's more affordable again we have it in excess so we're using it in everything and so not only**19:50**is it being pushed into our ultrarocessed foods in the forms of you know vegetable oils um all of our**19:55**processed grains uh corn syrup is a really big one wow yeah high fructose corn syrup corn syrup yeah we're also**20:01**using that to feed our livestock so we're also getting it on the other end in our meat our dairy and our eggs m and**20:08**glyphosate is incredibly concerning um it has very concerning back very concerning backstory so this is actually**20:14**what I did my Senate speech on i was uh so grateful to be a part of this round**20:20**table this nutrition round table it was hosted by Senator Ron Johnson back in September and it was with Vonnie Hari uh**20:27**Michaela Peterson Jordan Peterson RFK Jr cali and Casey Means i remember that it**20:32**was so amazing yeah some some of the talks that you guys gave were so impactful i mean thankfully a lot of**20:38**those videos have gone viral i've had the majority of those people on my podcast and it was so impactful i**20:44**actually remember seeing Cali Means um on the Tucker Carlson show with his**20:49**sister and for someone that is you know as woke whatever you want to call it and**20:55**aware of the biohacking community nutrition in general um I was blown away because he laid out the sequence of**21:02**corruption and I and I think that those two particularly have a really interesting skill set and background**21:08**even though now they have a shared mission you know one coming from a very alopathic I think she was a head neck surgeon from Stanford yeah um and and**21:16**then he came from highly educated um and he came from the you know the political**21:23**side of things where he was lobbyist yeah he was working for as a lobbyist for companies like Coca-Cola yeah so**21:29**it's fascinating because he has a really he had a look under the hood that many people are not actually revealing to the**21:36**general public which was fascinating i had him on my podcast a couple years ago and same thing i was blown away because**21:41**a lot of what he is saying he's just validating what a lot of us have been trying to say for years and he came out**21:46**and he said "Yeah this is all true i was literally in the boardrooms." Yeah a part of these conversations yeah it was**21:51**part of my job to influence politicians for these certain outcomes and I think he just woke up one day and was like**21:58**"Wait a second this is all wrong." I mean when he started talking about the intentionality of it um that's what  <br>**Majority of Food on the Shelves Are Created with Profits in Mind, Not Our Health22:06**really began to sway my opinion it's one thing to be doing something and not know**22:12**it's another to know intentionally continue and intentionally and**22:17**aggressively cover it up to the point where you're actually willing to ruin somebody else's life or smy's reputation**22:23**you know armed children um you know that's when you realize the sinister intention of it and one of the things he said I'll never forget was that uh his**22:31**group had five lobbyists for every member of Congress that's nuts so so I'm**22:38**just thinking man if you're So if you're a member of Congress and this is only one group you know one lobbying group**22:43**has five lobbyists assigned to you and he was like it was our role to try to take up all their calendar slots**22:49**contribute to their campaigns support their events whine dine them whine them dine them um and and to try to just**22:57**overwhelm them with meetings and appointments and and and essentially try to take up as much of their bandwidth as**23:02**they they possibly could um and that's when I realized man we have more of an**23:08**intentionality behind this than than I thought you know just like you said I don't think it began with sinister**23:14**intentions right we need you have famine you need to feed the nation yep um and then it just grew into this big chemical**23:20**agricultural industry a lot of which is wholly unnecessary now exactly and and**23:27**humanity is is paying the price exactly like again you know at the time I think**23:32**it was great it was this modern technology oh my gosh what do you mean we don't have to can everything now we can just add these additives and**23:37**preservatives in there that will prolong the shelf life this is what many people need to understand is that the majority**23:43**of the food on our shelves was not created with health in mind it was created uh with profits in mind because**23:49**they want it to be shelf stable so that it can stay it can stay on the shelf for long periods of time right i was doing**23:55**this little like personal experiment at my house um still kind of ongoing and I've released two videos about this**24:00**already but I bought just a bunch of conventional bread loaves of bread from the grocery store in December i got**24:06**Sarah Lee and some other like December yeah it's what April now exactly it's almost April those bags have been open**24:14**they've just been opened sitting on my counter and since December and there is not a drop of mold on any single one of**24:20**them not nothing they smell quote unquote fresh like it's still squishy**24:26**it's not dry really yes wow oil that's the preservatives that's the additives**24:32**that's Wow folic acid ex yep exactly all of those things so you're hyperfocused**24:38**on glyphosate because um you know they call it a forever chemical and I'm I'd**24:45**love for you to define what that means um but why glyphosate in particular so**24:51**glyphosate well first of all the reason I'm most concerned about it is because it's it's become so ubiquitous so we're**24:57**spraying it on all of our fields um the the backstory of glyphosate is uh they**25:02**were using a lot of these chemicals in uh World War II nazis were using them in nerve as nerve agents in gas chambers**25:09**they weren't using glyphosate specifically but they were using known insecticides and pesticides and they  <br>**Risks of Glyphosate in Our Foods25:16**have similar chemical components to glyphosate um and then same with the Vietnam War uh Agent Orange was created**25:22**by Monsanto um so now fast forward these agrochemical companies need somewhere to**25:27**use their chemicals and their fertilizers and so they pivoted to spraying them on farmlands and what**25:33**happened initially is they said "Oh they're totally fine these are not harmful at all to to health." So the**25:38**farmers are spraying down their crops everything and the glyphosate was killing everything including the plants**25:44**that they were trying to grow so what happened was they genetically modified seeds they genetically modified plants to grow to where they could just spray**25:51**the fields with glyphosate and everything would get covered in glyphosate and the plant itself wouldn't die but it would kill everything else**25:57**off well here's the issue with that and this is where I get super passionate about something called regenerative**26:02**farming because the soil we talk a lot about soil health so glyphosate also acts like an antibiotic which means that**26:08**it's not only killing off bad bacteria but it's also killing off the good bacteria wow and we talked about how a lot of people are consuming glyphosate**26:15**and they're getting it in their bodies and then everyone's having all these you know IBS and Crohn's and gut issues and**26:20**antibiotic resistance exactly well it's no wonder because all of us are consuming an antibiotic almost on a**26:25**daily basis and we don't even know and on top of that it's not labeled it doesn't need to be on the label so  <br>**Feeding Garbage to the Livestock Animals26:31**people can be consuming it and they have no clue um now the where my passion really comes in in all this is that when**26:36**we're spraying our soil with glyphosate because it's an antibiotic we're killing off the entire ecosystem of the soil**26:42**that makes the plants healthy in the first place i don't know if you've heard this before but I've heard this quoted often we are only as healthy as our soil**26:49**is no doubt because our plants are growing in our soil and if our soil does not have the ecosystem the bacteria the**26:55**bugs there's this whole ecosystem that half of what we probably still don't even understand what's going on there we're killing all of that the soil is**27:01**barely hanging on and then we think that the plants that are going to grow out are going to come out with enough vitamins minerals and nutrients for us**27:07**absolutely not and when you leave nature to do what it is intended to do what it's meant to do which is a thing called**27:13**regenerative farming there's this I love this I there's this incredible process that happens called carbon sequestration**27:20**where carbon is actually pulled out of the atmosphere because a lot of people were super concerned for good reason about there being too much carbon in the**27:25**atmosphere if we leave nature to do her thing she pulls the carbon out of the atmosphere and that is actually food for**27:31**the soil and if we're not spraying it with all these chemical interventions we're letting the soil thrive with the**27:37**bacteria and the bugs and everything that it's meant to be and how it's meant to be there the carbons in the soil and**27:42**it's this really deep rich like beautiful black soil that's going to be food for the plants and we see so many**27:50**articles now saying "Oh our our food is losing you know it's devoid of vitamins minerals and nutrients." You talk about**27:55**this all the time yeah I talk about it all the time you know it's funny i I I love the book that you read we are What**28:01**but but I think we're we're also what we eat eats yes right and which is getting**28:06**you closer to the soil i mean I I totally agree when you have you know when we feed livestock um you know if**28:13**you've ever driven by a commercial feed lot um it's it's really kind of a sad**28:19**sad place you know it's just acres and acres of dirt and mud no grass as far as**28:24**the eye can see feed troughs you know which are very often corn soybean um**28:30**millet these other things um and I've even there's a butcher in Naples that**28:35**I'm I'm friends with and they stopped buying meat from a certain uh farm and**28:40**he said they were actually adding high fructose corn syrup to the feed um and the meat was so full of pus because the**28:48**because they were sick because the animals were dying of type 2 diabetes right before they were slaughtered they**28:53**were on their way to dying from from um type two diabetes i mean where in nature's does a cow run into high**28:58**fructose corn syrup and he said it was actually causing the their teeth to rot all the way up into the gums because**29:03**they so they would lose their teeth so they couldn't really couldn't really chew and I love cows that actually breaks my heart yeah I do too i love**29:11**animals in general i mean but Yes well I saw something online too and a farmer actually verified this to me um they're**29:18**starting to feed candy to our livestock now too just to fatten them up they don't even think about the nutritional**29:23**value anymore of like oh how can we feed them so that they're you know healthy and they get enough nutrients no they're just like how can we fatten them up as**29:30**fast and quick as possible so they're feeding them candy bars they'll just throw candy bars in their feed and sometimes they don't even take the**29:35**wrappers off I heard yeah it's Yeah i mean you see a lot of those u you know videos of the uh especially especially**29:42**pigs that are eating Yes garbage but a lot of it has plastic in it i mean they don't even take the take the plastic out**29:48**of it so so where does this go so you know glyphosate is an issue and um you**29:54**know for the first time maybe in our whole lifetime there is potential opportunity to affect public policy**30:00**because of people like yourself going and speak in front of Congress um and the whole Maha movement which I think is**30:07**just phenomenal no matter what side of the aisle you're on you've got to be pro- nutrition prohealthy food because**30:12**we all deserve especially our children deserve clean food so where does this go**30:17**in a in a perfect world where does your mission um where can you have the  <br>**Courtney Swan’s Mission30:22**greatest effect that's a great question i mean look if I could just change one**30:28**thing it would just be can we just get these additives out of our food and focus on real food i think a lot of it**30:36**is um there's an education component there because there's a large portion of the population that's been eating so**30:42**much foods out of packages that they one are scared to cook now or they feel like they can't cook or maybe it hasn't been**30:48**passed down through generations through them anymore so I definitely think there's an educational component there so how can we um really start like in**30:56**honestly what I would love to see is we start doing this in schools with kids you know have them when they're in kindergarten have them start tending a**31:02**garden and teach them the importance of growing your food and then show them how that food is then ending up on their**31:09**plates for lunch you know and then how can we have them have a cooking class you know i think this should start very**31:14**very early because there is a large education component there because now we're just tell because this is I have a**31:21**huge issue about this i actually just talked about this on a podcast yesterday we are telling people "Oh you don't have**31:27**time to cook or it's so expensive don't even try." So I think so many people are not even trying anymore they're not even**31:32**attempting it because they just think like "Okay well that's that's one that's too expensive for me and it's not going to be accessible for me and it's super**31:38**hard." We live in the most amazing time of information you can literally open Tik Tok open YouTube and just type in**31:45**any recipe you want to make and you can watch a video of it so you can very easily and I I think so many people are**31:51**scared to cook but it is so easy it doesn't have to be complicated grill up a steak right and then bake some sweet**31:58**potatoes and then add a little arugula on the side like done it does not have to be so hard so from a policy**32:05**standpoint what we need to do is a couple things i think first of all we need to stop paying subsidies for foods**32:11**that are driving our chronic disease m corn and soy like I said earlier are largely making up of the majority of the**32:17**food like products is it corn soy wheat those are the big ones yes corn soy are the majority yes so over 90% of our corn**32:24**is genetically modified and over 90% of our soy is genetically modified and those are a lot of what we're paying**32:30**subsidies for um and then wheat as well and then wheat is just now starting to be genetically modified and so that**32:36**means that it's it can withstand glyphosate so you hear all this you hear all this talk online saying "Oh GMOs**32:42**actually means less pesticides." No the pesticides are quite literally in some of those seeds that are genetically modified and if they're not they're**32:49**having to spray everything like crazy with glyphosates so it actually means more pesticides not less yeah because if**32:55**something is um genetically modified to be resistant to glyphosate it's probably going to absorb and survive holding on**33:02**to the glyphosate i mean we already know that it not only it not only makes it into our food supply it makes it into**33:08**our blood it made it into my blood and if it's getting in mine it's getting in everybody's i promise you exactly**33:13**because we're eating organic and we're going above and beyond i mean I filter my water i filter my shower i'm eating**33:19**all organic in my home the only time I don't eat organic is when I'm eating out and I can't control it like many of you**33:25**the hardest thing for me is to shut off my mind at night when I want to sleep and it's funny because sometimes I'll**33:30**wake up tired already thinking of when I'll get back to bed again but exactly the moment that I lay my head on the**33:36**pillow it feels like the machine of crazy what if thoughts is turned back on does this happen to you let me tell you**33:42**my new secret to deal with this you may have heard of Magnesium Breakthrough by B by B Optimizers and how great it is**33:49**for sleep and promoting calmness and relaxation what I found out is that the brains behind Magnesium Breakthrough**33:55**have taken it to the next level with a product specifically designed for sleep it's called Sleep Breakthrough and it's**34:02**been a total gamecher for me sleep Breakthrough combines the power of magnesium with other natural ingredients**34:07**to help us fall asleep faster stay asleep longer and actually wake up feeling refreshed since I started taking**34:13**Sleep Breakthrough I've been waking up feeling rested energized and ready to tackle the day ahead i highly recommend**34:19**giving Sleep Breakthrough a try trust me visit buyimizers that's**34:27**biopimizers.com and order now oh and in addition to the discount you'll get by using the promo code ultimate they're**34:33**always amazing free gifts with your purchase that's also why I love shopping at By Optimizers go now to**34:41**byoptimizers.com/ultimate to get your sleep breakthrough and find out this month's gift with your purchase now**34:47**let's get back to the Ultimate Human podcast you know I've heard you talk a lot about too I actually want to come**34:52**back to um regenerative farming but I heard you say something that you know organic eating is now no longer  <br>**Organic Eating Should No Longer Be Negotiable34:59**negotiable um and I wonder if you might describe organic eating organic food**35:05**labeling um because I think too that there is maybe it's not direct corruption but there's a lot of**35:12**misinformation if you will on organic food food labeling so for the average consumer walking into the grocery store**35:19**it's like okay um I'm going to sacrifice some other areas of my budget because**35:24**I'm going to make sure that my family is eating the cleanest you know organic food where do they start on that journey**35:30**yeah well first and foremost the reason I'm such a huge supporter of organic food in general is because there's a lot**35:36**of laws and regulations around what is allowed and what is allowed to be sprayed on organic food so legally by**35:43**law if it's stamped organic it means that it was not allowed to be sprayed by glyphosate um if it's meat or dairy it**35:49**wasn't allowed to be injected with growth hormones they're not allowed to give them you know pharmaceutical drugs there's a lot of laws around there also**35:56**they can't eat genetically modified crops wow with organics so if you buy organic meat Exactly you know that**36:02**they're not eating this pesticide laden grains right so that to me is the**36:08**biggest concern right now and why I feel like it's non-negotiable but what is so insidious about all this**36:14**is that organic is just what we should be eating there should not be two different options what I would love to**36:19**see is that we're just not using these pesticides anymore and organic is just the only option it's just food right**36:26**because you know 50 years ago when our grandparents were eating they were eating organic but they weren't labeling it organic it just was food it's so true**36:32**you know I heard Max Lou say on a podcast one time "If your grocery store has a healthy food section what does**36:38**that tell you about the rest of the story what is the rest of it?" Like I mean it was just so simple but I I've loved it i actually was in uh uh**36:45**Medigene Colombia a while back and we were eating in this restaurant and I ordered steak**36:50**and I asked the guy if the steak was grass-fed and he literally looked at me like I had two heads and and because you**36:58**know for him he was like "What else do cows eat?" like why are you asking me that of course it's grass-fed and and I**37:05**was it it just dawned on me i was like well in the States we have to ask this right we have we have to check i realize**37:11**here all they eat is grass because you guys got it right you know um which I think is part of the reason why you see**37:18**our life expectancy has dropped we talked about this on on your podcast but you know um has dropped to 66th in the**37:24**world you know beneath some countries that don't even have clean water and sanitation and I think in countries like**37:32**that um your only accessible food is is real is real food it's whole food and**37:40**this is supported by Blue Zone Research they were all eating whole food they didn't eat dogmatic diets there was you**37:46**know almost zero processed ingredients in in the diets of these centinarians um**37:52**plus they moved and they had a sense of community um but I want to I want to work my way back to regenerative farming**37:57**because there has to be an answer other than just stop poisoning the food because the what the chemical industry**38:04**is going to say is if we stop spraying glyphosate or if we stop spraying glyphosate on the crops all the pests**38:11**are going to eat it the you know the uh this is an herbicide the weeds are going to take over um and that's going to be**38:16**worse for your food than what you're getting in this small amount of micro**38:22**poisoning what we have as the grass guideline right that generally regarded as as safe and and I think that a lot of**38:29**these um guidelines are based on single dose toxicity meaning yeah if you go out**38:37**and eat an inorganic piece of um fish or chicken or you know traditionally fed**38:42**cow and some you know non-organic vegetables is that going to kill you in a single meal no but it's the cumulative**38:48**dose toxicity right over time exactly um that our our cellular biology just can't**38:54**handle anymore yeah and and our immune systems can't handle it anymore well we're seeing a really concerning trend**39:00**right now i would encourage people to Google this because you can actually look up photos so look you can never  <br>**The Sustainability of Agriculture39:05**outsmart nature nature always finds a way and what's happening with a lot of these weeds that were initially being**39:10**killed off by glyphosate you're seeing these crazy glyphosate resistant weeds**39:15**popping up everywhere that the farmers don't really know how to handle because they're no longer uh responding to the**39:21**glyphosate right and so it's again like nature always finds a way it's similar to like you know like the antibiotic resistance that we see when you're**39:27**taking too much antibiotics and we're seeing it a lot because we're we're giving it prophylactically to our livestock so there is yeah there's a**39:35**huge concern with that as well and um there's there's a lot of push back against the organic movement from the**39:41**agrochemical companies because they say well how are the farmers going to survive how are we going to feed the world how are we going to going to**39:48**create enough food for everyone and what I always tell people is there's this amazing farming systems trial that's**39:53**been going on for 40 years and what it is it's been an ongoing study that's still happening right now they've been doing it for 40 years through the Rodell**40:00**Institute and what they do is they have conventional farming on one side and then they have organic farming on the other side no it's incredible and what**40:07**they have found is that in this organic farming system it produces the same if**40:13**not sometimes even more yield than what the conventional is yielding and then on top of that it's sustainable because**40:20**what we're doing in our conventional model right now is we're getting to a point where we are desertifying the soil**40:25**yes and we're depleting it of so much nutrients that at some point you literally cannot plant there anymore and**40:30**you have to go somewhere else to plant and they are theorizing and if we continue down this path and we keep**40:36**ignoring this that we have about depending on who you talk to anywhere between like 52 to 54 harvests left**40:42**where we will no longer have soil that's plantable for plants wow so we need to**40:47**do something because what we're doing right now it's just a quick fix right it's not long-term sustainable and our**40:54**you know our grandkids are not even going to have soil left to plant in what is sustainable agriculture what is what**41:01**is regenerative farming um and and can we do that on a mass scale and still**41:07**allow farmers to be profitable and maybe clean up the food supply you know I get**41:12**a lot of my stuff here in Miami from this place called Southwest Ranches which is right down the street and they're hyper um vigilant about where**41:21**they source their meats their line caught fish their their their honey their you know their maple syrups you**41:27**know all of their raw raw dairies i can tell when I'm home and I'm eating that**41:32**type of food and then when I go on the road and my choices are limited um my wife can too like instantly um feel it**41:40**it's just like we were saying before when you go to Italy and you have a bowl of pasta and a basket of bread and you feel amazing and you come back here and**41:46**you have a bowl of pasta and a basket of bread and you blow up like a tick exactly yeah you blow up like a tick but um do**41:54**you have a hope that maybe under this Maha movement that the subsidies coming**42:00**from the taxpayer will go towards quality foods i really hope so that is**42:06**one of my number one dreams like hopes that we get out of Maja i know uh Robert**42:11**F kennedy Jr is incredibly passionate about regenerative farming and I know he knows about it and also too we know that**42:18**it can be done large scale i mean we have these farmers like Will Harris and Joel Salatin that have these huge  <br>**The Possible Outcomes of Regenerative and Sustainable Farming is Subsidized42:24**regenerative farms and they all came from the traditional conventional path and they switched over to regenerative**42:31**and they also um provide a lot of resources for farmers that want to switch over it's also healthier for the**42:36**farmers because they're not using all this glyphosate and all the other stuff that so many of these farmers no one is really talking about this so many of**42:42**these farmers are now getting non-hodkins lymphoma oh yeah they're getting crazy aggressive forms of cancer**42:48**from using these chemicals exactly but you know part of the issue**42:53**is that we need an entire reform of our food system here in America because right now we have I don't know the exact**42:59**number but we have a small amount of just really large industrialized farms**43:04**and then they're just shipping out everything across the country and what people don't realize is that an apple that you get at the grocery store has**43:11**probably been it was probably three weeks from being picked because Wow they picked it and then they sprayed it with**43:17**something in the truck that makes it ripen while it's on its trip to you and**43:22**then finally by the time you get it at the grocery store it was picked like 3 weeks ago and it was ripened in the back of a truck not on a tree right and we're**43:29**doing this largely across all of our our food systems so what we need to do is we need to incentivize farmers to go back**43:35**to regenerative farming we need more local farms yeah where we can get local produce from our communities and and and**43:42**do you think that um there'll be a point where we start to**43:48**subsidize regenerative farming and sustainable you know sustainable agriculture and we actually get back to**43:55**taking good care of the soil because I I see it in in our clinic system too you**44:01**know so many human beings are just nutrient deficient yes you know they're vitamin they're mineral they're amino**44:07**acid they're nutrient deficient and when you look at the importance of these nutrients in the human body you know how**44:13**our calcium and phosphorus form hydroxy appatite to create bones and that process needs 12 minerals um when we're**44:21**actually creating neurotransmitters which form the basis of our mood that process needs raw materials vitamins**44:27**which used to be prevalent in our food supply and they used to be prevalent in our fruits and our vegetables and now**44:32**it's it's just so um depleted i wonder if there's you know um you know an era**44:41**where we're not subsidizing non-foods we're actually subsidizing you know that**44:47**would be amazing why can't we subsidize whole real foods and encourage more local farmers to want to get back into**44:53**farming um I think a lot of these smaller farmers that are super passionate about all this they're they're all getting pushed out by these**44:59**big industrialized farms that are taking over everything and then they're just ruining our food supply and they're  <br>**The Impact of the Chemical Industry on Our Health45:04**spraying everything and they're conventionally farming and Yeah and your to your point um I mean you talk about**45:09**this all the time in the nutritional deficiencies americans are overfed and undernourished yes they're eating so**45:15**much we're actually overfed because we're undernourished which is really interesting exactly exactly right and**45:20**we're not getting enough nutrients from our foods because we're really not eating a lot of real foods anymore and then when we are we're they're devoid of**45:28**vitamins and minerals and nutrients that were there before and this is another argument for organic they do a lot of um**45:34**there's been a lot of studies and testing done and they find time and time again that conventional crops I you**45:39**think that the organic food is lower and devoid of nutrients and minerals and vitamins the conventionally grown has**45:45**like nothing left right so at least with organic it's higher in the vitamin minerals content mineral content and**45:50**it's still a lot lower than generations before but at least in organic it has higher amounts than the conventional**45:56**does you know and I think too that when you when you look at cellular biology I**46:01**mean these these deficiencies trace to very specific conditions and diseases and it's not like um all vaccines cause**46:08**autism all glyphosate causes cancer it's you know we it's this multiffactorial**46:14**thing where you know our food system has become so corrupt and I wonder if we**46:19**might even talk for a moment about the influence that the chemical industry has on our you know government and public**46:26**policy some of that's happening right now yeah and I want you to bring it up so that you disappear and I can continue**46:31**my podcast um my fiance is I always tell my audience I'm like if I disappear open**46:37**an investigation because I'm really really happy i'm like I love my family i love my wife yes not suicidal i love my**46:45**family i'm about to get married i'm very excited no I mean really honestly my fiance recently was like um are are you**46:51**are we good talking about some of this stuff publicly like are you going to be okay and I you know I'm very spiritual**46:57**and I I really believe that I came to earth with a purpose and my purpose is to help people thrive and wake them up**47:05**to I think it's greater than even the food system but I think right now currently my mission is to help people**47:10**wake up to their own innate power and knowingness about themselves and knowing how to feed themselves and how to take**47:16**care of themselves and how to thrive because the human body wants to be healthy we just need to give it the**47:23**right tools to and healthy can mean it's so much more than just diet right it's it's your mental state um it's your**47:30**community how much sleep you're getting like it's more than just the food but I really believe that I came here with a**47:35**purpose and I I just can't shut up so like sorry I'm not going to stop talking**47:41**about it and so I feel like I have a certain protection i know he's like Courtney you're going to get um but okay**47:49**so glyphosate so this is a this is where this is where it does**47:55**become insidious because now that they they know that this is happening so um I mentioned earlier Monsanto was bought**48:01**out by Bayer in 2018 and then shortly after that Mon or Bayer but which was before Monsanto started getting pulled**48:08**into a ton of litigations with mostly farmers but just Americans in general that were getting non-hodkins lymphoma**48:14**from glyphosate right to this day they have spent over $2 billion paying back**48:20**farmers and other Americans that have gotten non-hodkins lymphoma from glyphosate the ARC which is the**48:26**International Agency for Research on Cancer through the World Health Organization**48:31**says that glyphosate it classifies glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen now meaning that we probably**48:38**basically know that it causes cancer so this is why it's so incredibly concerning and now Bayer knows this um**48:46**but they are currently working and they're going state by state it's actually on the governor's desk right**48:51**now um in Georgia they're going state by state they're trying to go through their legislators through their senators to**48:58**get immunity from being sued if someone gets cancer so essentially if this passes in Georgia it would mean that if**49:06**you or I were farming or just in general if we were using glyphosate in our lawn and we got cancer and the research shows**49:12**that glyphosate's connected to cancer and we got the cancer and we're using the glyphosate we would not legally be allowed to sue them it's actually the**49:18**same thing that the vaccine companies went for in 1986 which is the immunity shield where if you get harmed by a**49:23**vaccine you can't hold the company liable right so that is mind-numbing to me i mean it's it's insidious why can't**49:30**we just stop using the chemicals but instead they're they're pushing back even further and they want to get this**49:36**immunity and if it passes through Georgia there's a huge concern that then it's just going to you know pass like wildfire throughout all the other states**49:43**wow so we're currently trying to block it in fact I post about it all the time on my Instagram um I post numbers that**49:48**you can call emails you can call i'm going to do that too yes yeah give me that information because I will stand with you on that so if I bring this back**49:55**to the consumer you know I'm a mother or father i'm listening to this podcast um**50:00**I'm concerned you've sort of woken me up to this uh what do I do tomorrow right i**50:06**mean how do I where do I start in the grocery store um you know without really  <br>**Actionable Steps People Can Start Doing to Improve Their Health50:11**breaking my budget what are some ways to avoid some of the most sinister things because we're not going to shift**50:18**everybody's habits you know all the way overnight but I think a lot of people**50:24**hearing this are like willing to make incremental change yeah so where does that start with them around the kitchen**50:31**well okay i think first and foremost uh this is I would be remissed without talking about this you have to reframe**50:39**and understand that there may be a little bit of budgeting and reframing of priorities that has to happen because**50:45**unfortunately we are living in a time right now if you do not make time for your wellness you will be forced to make**50:50**time for your illness it is just that dire at this point and I'm not trying to scare anyone but I just I believe in**50:57**telling people the truth and if you know this then you're going to be way more inclined to actually want to take action**51:04**so some of that is okay instead of you know eating out for every meal or postmating everything or going to**51:10**Starbucks every single morning how can you make that coffee at home how can you stop getting food delivered every single**51:17**night how can you have just dinner out one night a week and make it more of a special thing and start focusing on**51:23**buying groceries and cooking at home it doesn't have to be these fancy you know five course meals it can be something really simple to make um I think also**51:31**too people think that fast food is cheap it is no longer cheap in fact I did a series on my podcast called Organic for**51:38**Everyone it was so much fun really yes my producer and I would go and we would buy really popular fast food items and**51:44**see how much the cost of that was like we did Taco Bell cheesy gordita crunch for example and then we also bought all**51:50**the ingredients to make that at home every single ingredient was organic we were buying it from super accessible stores like Walmart Ralph's Kroger**51:58**really okay every single ingredient was organic and then we made a copycat of that at home and every single time it**52:03**was cheaper to buy all organic groceries and make it at home than it was to go through the drive-thru oh that's so**52:08**amazing i'm I'm I I'm going on your Instagram and I'm going to re re I'm**52:14**going to I'm going to reforward all all of your videos and and and and put them up on my Instagram and if you want to**52:19**make me a collaborate on them I would love to help you get the message out because I do this similar thing called lateral shifts where um you know I'll**52:28**take anything that people like to eat and um I try to make them two promises one I won't change the flavor profile**52:35**and two I won't add a dime to their budget and I had a very similar experience um you know so people would**52:41**go to their you know refrigerator and and sometimes these are on lives you know we got thousands of people on and**52:48**they'll go to the refrigerator and they'll in the refrigerator and they'll say "What do you like to eat in there?" Like "Oh I love this uh I won't say the**52:54**brand name but this yogurt brand with fruit on the bottom and it's all the individual like peel off bags." Like**53:00**"Okay well let's spin that around." And you look at the back and it's like 54 grams of sugar high fructose corn syrup**53:05**there it is um natural fruit flavor you know which means ain't got no fruit and**53:11**um and and you say "Well which one of those do you like to eat?" "Oh I like the blueberry." You say "Okay so what**53:16**we're going to do is we're going to go to the grocery store we're going to buy a quart of whole fat Greek yogurt we're**53:22**going to take um a basket of organic blueberries and um we're going to get a bag of monk fruit and you're just going**53:29**to scoop some of that whole fat Greek yogurt in there you can throw in a fistful of organic blueberries and put a teaspoon teaspoon and a half of monk**53:36**fruit mix it up and you tell me if you know how's that taste like it's amazing**53:41**and when you actually look at the buying it by the quart and the basket and the bag versus buying it in a lot of these**53:48**convenience exactly so a lot of times like the the crap food is packaged in a**53:54**convenient way and so people are actually paying for the convenience exactly and getting the crappy food and**54:01**and I think that's a big narrative that needs to shift is the expense of**54:08**convenience of convenience i say this all the time convenience is killing us it really is and we think that it's so I**54:15**said this earlier it has been so hammered into us oh it's so expensive to eat healthy it's so expensive i am not I**54:21**I'm by no means saying that I think that um that some of this stuff is not overpriced and I know if you really**54:27**start getting into ins and outs of it it can get really expensive but if you are dire straits really on a budget forget**54:33**the organic okay that is concerning and I focus on it but like if you are dire straits and you were just trying to eat**54:38**more whole real foods just get ground beef rice beans a big court of yogurt um**54:44**normally eggs are well priced i think they're going back down right now they're back down now i think so right i heard they're like back like four or**54:50**five years ago prices okay i need to I've been traveling so I haven't gone to store recently**54:56**but you know focus on the basics like that and like you said get fruit and get yogurt and just focus on eating as many**55:03**whole real foods as you can and dump all the convenience because it's expensive over the last 20 years in human biology**55:09**one compound I've trusted again and again is NAD+ it's critical for energy**55:15**focus and cellular repair but your levels drop around age 30 i used to**55:20**administer NAD via IVs in my clinics but now I take Rorow Nutrition's liposomaal**55:26**NAD the first oral formula that actually works their advanced delivery tech gets**55:31**NAD straight into your bloodstream i take one teaspoon daily and the results are real clean energy sharper focus and**55:38**better recovery you can try it risk-free with the Ultimate 15 code at checkout for 15% off just put in Ultimate 15 at**55:47**checkout you'll receive 15% off and your cells will thank you now let's get back to the Ultimate Human Podcast**55:54**you know I I I see too that there's a lot of free apps out there right now um there's like Seed Oil Scout um and I**56:02**Trash Panda what is it called trash Panda where you can scan everything so people can go and scan everything in the grocery store and it's called Trash**56:08**Panda that's actually kind of a cool name i know it's such a cute name i love it that's catchy trash Panda great job**56:14**and so you scan the QR code on any food label exactly and it'll tell you and then it'll tell you it rates it and then**56:20**they tell you all the ingredients that are red flag why they're red flags and then it'll it'll give you um alternative**56:26**options really yeah it's really cool that is amazing okay so I'm going to link these in my show notes like Seed Oil Scout um what is it trash Panda**56:34**trash Panda panda uh there's another one that will um and I'm gonna I'm gonna figure it out it's just not coming to me**56:39**right now that will tell you where um your local farmers markets are yes um and shockingly when I look at the number**56:48**of places where you can buy locally grown food nearly every**56:54**state in North Dakota you know I mean like colder climates um you know there's a lot of places that have farmers that**57:01**are that are growing foods and make it available to the public and there's there's apps that you can use to help you find that y um I use one here called**57:08**South West uh Ranches and raw dairy raw cheese you know their bees their their**57:16**honeys i mean and it's and it's just it's just amazing and I think that we could have a shift and I also believe**57:23**that awareness is key because through people like yourself myself and all of our peers if if it becomes politically**57:33**not cool to be siding with chemicals synthetics pharmaceuticals highly**57:40**processed foods which is poisoning our children that's a giant win and if the**57:47**consumer you know if their buying habits shift then there's no choice but for the**57:53**market to shift it drives the consumer trends actually during our Senate speech uh Jason Karp who's the founder of Hugh**58:00**Kitchen he actually said this and he has he he knows what it's like to be in**58:05**those boardrooms with those companies and he said that a company like for example Kellogg's General Mills if they**58:11**see just a 10% drop in their sales they scramble just 10% do you know how little that is billions of dollars but exact  <br>**Profit-Driven Food Companies58:18**but I mean from our perspective of like if we all of a sudden just decide like we're not going to buy from their products anymore and we're going to buy**58:24**from a smaller local farm or you know a smaller company that's actually doing right by us that doesn't take that many**58:29**people to see a huge shift like that and I mean look at organic organic has absolutely exploded in the last 10 years**58:35**and it's all driven by consumer trends we drive that with our money i think people don't understand how much power**58:41**we actually really have yeah and I think that now there's an opportunity because of social media which can be good or bad**58:47**but because of social media to kind of circumvent that system too to circumvent that media narrative because it it was**58:53**really interesting just as a crazy exercise during the Super Bowl um this year we sat with my family and we were**58:59**just taking note of all the commercials yes it was all junk food oh my gosh it's like the consumer does doesn't even**59:06**stand a chance if I like I know the OMIC jingle by heart now oh oh**59:13**and it's like the choir's back there like I heard it singing along and you**59:19**know and then you know the Doritos commercials are so uh so cool but you know what I find really encouraging you**59:25**know we just banned Red Eye number three um there are certain states like Texas um um there's a state recently I want to**59:32**say West Virginia just banned it virginia um huge just uh banned it and**59:39**so this means now if you're one of these major manufacturers or distributors and**59:46**you just cut off an entire state um they're going to be forced to make that change for everyone else we will start**59:51**you know um and do you think that this is profit driven because they've already made the changes overseas i think this**59:57**is another thing that the public doesn't really you know Food Babe does a great job at highlighting this um raising**1:00:04**awareness to the fact that it's not something that can't be done because it's something they're already doing**1:00:09**exactly it's just they're not doing it here and these American companies are making these for other countries that's**1:00:15**what drives me nuts about it that blew my mind i know um that you know when you**1:00:20**compare the labels of uh you know a again I won't use a brand name but a box**1:00:25**of certain cereal here and the same box identical box of cereal made by the same manufacturer in the UK or even in Canada**1:00:33**in some cases the dramatic shift in the ingredients and I got to think it's just got to be pennies per product but you**1:00:39**know what that is actually so Jason Karp again was talking about this at our Senate hearing and he was emailing back**1:00:45**and forth with one of these companies and the issue is is that they have realized that the brightly colored**1:00:52**cereals and you know brightly colored fruit snacks or whatever it is that they're adding those dyes into make them**1:00:57**more appealing and addictive to children and so that's why they do it so Trixs actually famously a couple years ago**1:01:03**they took they announced we're we're taking out all the artificial colors yeah and they're like we're going to use**1:01:08**natural dyes you know to color them well they're not as bright because the**1:01:13**they're colors made in nature it's why when you see cereal it's like fluorescent highlighter color it's not**1:01:19**colors that you fluorescent highlighter mauve and chartreuse you're like I don't see those in nature i do not see those**1:01:25**in nature yeah it's like highlighter colors um they actually saw a dramatic**1:01:31**drop in their sales because Trixs was the only one that was doing it and so they brought them back so this is a**1:01:38**large part of the issue is that these companies are digging their heels in because they're like "No we're going to lose money off of the profit of these**1:01:45**cereals." And but I think also if there weren't alternatives well exactly if everyone was forced to then the kids**1:01:51**will just have to acclimate and honestly it will be so much better for them the reason why they've banned them in places like the UK and Sweden is because they**1:01:57**have recognized that these dyes cause hyperactivity in children talk to anyone who's an educator and who's been in the**1:02:04**space for the last 20 years i can't tell you how many teachers DM me almost on a day-to-day basis and they'll say "I've**1:02:10**been working for you know 20 years as an educator and I have never seen so many behavioral issues ever in my life."**1:02:15**Really yeah and you hear this in in schools i mean and you and and again it's multiffactorial and and I don't**1:02:22**want to sound the alarm on any one thing causing everything but you know at some point these skyrocketing rates of autism**1:02:29**skyrocketing rates of childhood cancer the skyrocketing rates of obesity it's scary the number of children now that**1:02:35**have fatty liver disease almost 15% of our our teens and preubescent teens have have fatty liver disease i mean that**1:02:41**used to be reserved for alcoholics alcoholics um oh that condition largely didn't exist 50 years ago that one**1:02:47**really gets me it gets me too and the you know autism which again is multiffactorial but it's a**1:02:52**neuralinflammatory condition and we know that certain things are causing these neural inflammatory cascades and a lot**1:02:59**of autism distance on the spectrum is related to the grade of inflammation that they have um and and and the amount**1:03:06**of this neural damage and the the exciting thing is that a lot of this is**1:03:13**reversible um and I think you know people like myself that had a career in**1:03:19**mortality coming together with people like yourself that have a career in nutrition and and other people that have**1:03:26**careers in politics and medicine you know we're all starting to realize that**1:03:31**man we really need to to do something but the solution is very promising like**1:03:38**it's it's really exciting it's not a restriction of the freedom of choice um because that is one way that this**1:03:44**movement gets attacked i get attacked you get attacked yeah um is that you know we're just going to strip free**1:03:50**choice away from everybody which is not what we're not saying you can't have ice cream we're not saying you can't you**1:03:56**know do all of those things that you you know are going to decimate your health but but there's no reason why we should**1:04:02**consciously be allowing this stuff Yeah into in into the the food system so um**1:04:09**you know back to the average mom and dad um you know or you know baby biohacker**1:04:15**that's that's just getting going what would you say because I love that you posed this question to me on your**1:04:20**podcast you know what are what are two or three things that they could do tomorrow um not big shifts in their  <br>**Simple Hacks You Can Start Doing Tomorrow1:04:26**budget that you think could dramatically change the trajectory of their health i would say first and**1:04:32**foremost do an audit of your pantry and just start paying attention and reading**1:04:38**ingredient labels if you can do that one shift and start slowly swapping out a**1:04:43**lot of your normal everyday food products that you're buying for ones that are made with real ingredients**1:04:49**you're going to be off to a great start so I have a really really simple hack for this when you're in the grocery**1:04:55**store and you're reading a label and you see all the ingredients in there you never want to just look at the front the**1:05:00**front is a billboard for the package they're just trying to sell it oh and they'll also often have the health claims on there which is exactly**1:05:06**something else that Max Luger talked about that I thought was it was also one of those just phenomenally obvious**1:05:12**things that I never really thought about before and he was like you realize that most health foods don't make health food**1:05:17**claims like there's not a claim on the avocado really healthy fatty acids you know maybe may lead to longevity and a**1:05:24**healthy heart but you you go to the seed oils and it's like heart healthy low and saturated fat polyunsaturated you know**1:05:30**it's like they try to um eight vitamins and um four nutrients fortified enriched**1:05:36**you know it's amazing well it's amazing how many non-health foods they they have**1:05:43**to make health claims you're right right on the front of the package so spin it around look at the ingredients yep and I**1:05:48**would say the more health claims they make on the front is usually a really red flag so you're you you'll learn**1:05:54**here's the thing the first couple times you do this you'll probably spend a couple of hours in the grocery store sorry but you get in a rhythm and then**1:06:00**you kind of understand and then you know what foods you like um and you kind of start to understand which ones are just**1:06:06**you tell it's a red flag you don't have to do it again exactly right so my rule is if you can read So read all those**1:06:12**ingredients if you could technically if you wanted to make this product at home I'm not saying you have to but let's say that you were like "Okay if I wanted to**1:06:18**make these crackers at home could I buy every single one of those ingredients in the grocery store?" I always use Simple Mills as an example simple Mills has**1:06:25**rosemary extract it's made with almonds um just all whole real foods you could**1:06:30**technically buy every single one of those ingredients in the grocery store and put it in your cart and make those crackers at home if you wanted to wow**1:06:36**whereas alternatively if you turn around something like CheezIts it has BHT in there it has some preservatives and some**1:06:42**other crap in there that you're reading that you're going I have no idea where I would find BHT in the grocery store where would I find that in the grocery**1:06:48**store it doesn't exist wow that's a great point so that would be something that I would say put that one back on**1:06:54**the shelf look around there's a lot of different alternatives now if you're looking for a cheese like cracker there's a couple of other brands now**1:06:59**that are creating ones that are just made with real food ingredients if you don't start doing something like that some of these other ones that is you're**1:07:06**already going to be off to a great start another one that I love to remind people real food tastes amazing**1:07:13**amazing it is so good especially if you you learn a couple things that you love**1:07:19**to make you can repeat those get you know follow some creators online that teach you how to make really simple**1:07:24**whole real food ingredient recipes also you don't have to give up your favorite foods we literally had burgers for lunch**1:07:29**yeah i eat burgers a couple times a week that's so awesome yeah we had And we had organ blend meats and we had the ground**1:07:36**beef with it and we had some shaved goat cheese on the top oh it was it was delicious right it was delicious it was**1:07:41**so good and this is what I remind people all the time you don't have to give up your favorite foods but make sure that**1:07:47**when you're eating those foods they're made with whole real food ingredients so if you can't find a restaurant nearby that's um you know using 100% Italian**1:07:54**flour or whatever it is in their pizza dough make pizza at home make those burgers at home or find a really good uh**1:07:59**burger place that has grass-fed burgers and you know beef tallow fries if you can find them um so that would be my**1:08:06**second one is you do not have to be restrictive in fact I have never had a**1:08:12**healthier relationship with my food ever in my entire life like I've never had a healthier relationship with it because**1:08:17**if as long as it's real food nothing is off the table for me i don't feel like I'm like "Oh I can't have that cookie or**1:08:22**whatever." I'm like "Is it made with real ingredients great i'm going to have the cookie." I love it yeah that's my only restriction is that I want it to be**1:08:29**made with real food right whereas before when I was eating like Slim Fast bars and stuff I was literally trying to like oh how many calories is in this and you**1:08:36**know like trying to track everything and I don't even think that way anymore yeah neither do I so I'd say that and then I**1:08:41**would say the last one is try to eat try to eat as many meals at home as you can**1:08:47**because when you eat out this is when you're going to start seeing the additives and the seed oils and everything else so try to eat as many**1:08:53**meals at home as possible i love it Courtney you're amazing you're definitely coming back on i hope um we**1:08:59**have so many friends in common and you know it's it's it's an

for everyone in your life and everyone**1:10:18**that you love um one of the main reasons that I got into healthy eating in the first place is because I knew what it**1:10:24**felt like to feel really sick i think a lot of people largely walk through life not even knowing how sick they actually**1:10:30**are and how sick they actually feel because they have no comparison and I went from feeling really good in my home**1:10:35**then going out of the home and eating like crap all the time feeling really sick and then coming back and realizing**1:10:41**oh my gosh like this is what so many Americans go through every day and they feel this way and they don't even realize it so I think learning how to**1:10:48**nourish my body take care of my body um and just to feel better and then as a**1:10:53**result I'm more clearheaded i'm more in touch with my innate knowing um what's best for me and I can have better**1:11:00**discernment and yeah it just it helps me live a better more full
