> 
> > _Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life. Jerzy Gregorek_
> 
> This bonus stage could be useful for you if you find yourself unable to act on ideas or goals. It’s a great way to cultivate mental toughness. Fear Setting was created by Tim Ferriss. Check out his book Tools of The Titans, and his blog on mental toughness here for more: [https://tim.blog/2016/12/14/mental-toughness/](https://tim.blog/2016/12/14/mental-toughness/). You find an option to do this in the Journal Database too!
> 
> - A 3-Step Guide to Fear Setting
>     
>     _This three-step exercise is designed to define your fears and big decisions and help you explore what you can do, or not do, in order to overcome them. Understanding our fears enables us to make difficult choices that can ultimately lead to a happier and more peaceful life._
>     
>     1. **Name** it. _E.g. I'm afraid to ..... because this will happen. 'I'm afraid that my family will think... 'etc._
>         
>         **Define** it. _List the worst case scenarios (sub-fears) that might happen when you think it._
>         
>     2. **Prevent**. _What can you do to prevent or minimise the possibility of it._
>         
>         **Repair**. _If ______ were to happen, how can i reduce it's effects or repair it?_
>         
>     3. **Benefits**. _If I were to face this fear, what might the benefits be from an attempt or semi-success?_
>
