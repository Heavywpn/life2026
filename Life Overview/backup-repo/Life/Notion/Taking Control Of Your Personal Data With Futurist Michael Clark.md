most people don't realize the way that00:00:07.240 Amazon says to you or by the way do you00:00:09.040 want that diaper that follows you around00:00:11.000 all those websites it's because your00:00:12.280 data is being sold behind the scenes00:00:13.759 through Brokers the average person now00:00:15.679 apparently has an attention span of 800:00:17.199 seconds and the last big attacks in00:00:19.080 terms of where people's data was stolen00:00:20.880 was because of human error data literacy00:00:22.680 is the worst it's ever been now let's00:00:24.599 talk about data but not in the way that00:00:27.119 you think these social media companies00:00:29.240 gather our dat data so that they can00:00:31.439 generate revenue from advertisers that00:00:33.920 want to advertise to people with00:00:35.879 specific parts of data in mind your data00:00:38.600 that you create is often duplicated so00:00:40.879 for example if you own three devices I00:00:43.200 own an Apple Watch Android phone all of00:00:45.440 these things I'm repeating the same data00:00:47.160 I can never connect it I can never pull00:00:48.800 it apart because it's living in00:00:50.239 different companies it's my data but00:00:52.079 it's separated now be prepared to have00:00:54.920 your mind blown I met Michael a week and00:00:57.840 a half ago spent an hour and a half with00:00:59.480 him and my head literally blew off so I00:01:02.760 know for sure it's going to have some00:01:04.400 impact on00:01:06.620 [Music]00:01:11.040 you hi everyone and welcome to this00:01:13.520 episode of the podcast now let's talk00:01:16.200 about data but not in the way that you00:01:19.040 think look these social media companies00:01:22.600 gather our data so that they can00:01:24.840 generate revenue from advertisers that00:01:27.320 want to advertise to people with00:01:29.479 specific parts of data in mind and that00:01:33.040 is really really profitable for these00:01:37.320 companies but why should they own our00:01:40.159 data why should they be in charge of our00:01:42.159 data why shouldn't we be in charge of00:01:44.640 our own data why shouldn't we make money00:01:47.159 from our own data and how can our own00:01:49.560 data help us live a healthier and00:01:52.759 happier life that is the question that00:01:55.520 Michael Clark is going to answer today00:01:58.320 now be prepared to to have your mind00:02:01.399 blown I met Michael a week and a half00:02:03.799 ago spent an hour and a half with him00:02:05.399 and my head literally blew off so I know00:02:08.679 for sure it's going to have some impact00:02:10.360 on you so let's cue the music and ask00:02:12.840 ourselves the question why don't we own00:02:15.160 our own data and what can we do to get00:02:17.319 it back and potentially benefit from it00:02:26.330 [Music]00:02:35.519 all right folks let me tell you about00:02:37.400 iopn the internet of people iopn is the00:02:40.720 next iteration of the internet using00:02:43.000 revolutionary blockchain technology00:02:45.159 that's built on decentralized community00:02:47.200 ownership now when I say decentralized00:02:48.920 community ownership I mean it's not only00:02:51.239 controlled by a bunch of tech Giants00:02:53.400 instead everyone who's part of it has a00:02:55.680 say and a stake in how things run it00:02:58.000 gives regular people like me and you and00:03:00.319 businesses and Brands an easy and fair00:03:02.959 chance to grow and make some money and00:03:05.200 build communities iopn is making things00:03:07.879 happen through a few key verticals now00:03:10.400 let's go through them OPN chain is a00:03:12.920 Cutting Edge layer one blockchain that's00:03:15.720 efficient scalable and eco-friendly IE00:03:18.760 cognitive a set of AI tools changing how00:03:21.920 we develop apps yeah develop apps OPN00:03:24.920 verse a dynamic hyper realistic AI00:03:28.200 powered platform that's making web 300:03:30.959 experiences better big organizations00:03:33.239 like Dubai multicommodity Center Dubai00:03:35.760 World Trade Center and Ras Al government00:03:38.360 are already seeing the potential with00:03:39.879 IOP in themselves it's about creating a00:03:43.000 web3 future where technology serves us00:03:46.319 you know us the people unlike what web 200:03:49.120 did where we often end up serving big00:03:51.720 tech companies check out the internet of00:03:53.680 people today and see how you can00:03:55.200 leverage their ecosystem I promise you00:03:57.400 it's worth the Time Michael thank you so00:04:00.239 much for coming to join us on the show00:04:01.400 today that's a pleasure to be here some00:04:03.360 of what you said to me when I first met00:04:05.079 you scared the hell out of me um some of00:04:08.159 it excited me and that's why I was00:04:09.879 really Keen to get you on the show and00:04:12.000 share with our audience today this00:04:15.360 fascinating world of data and to be00:04:18.199 honest with you most people are naive00:04:20.839 ignorant or or I just choose maybe not00:04:25.360 to want to know what's going on in the00:04:27.120 world these these flash terms that keep00:04:28.960 being brought up now nowadays AI you00:04:30.919 know what does it mean and how can it00:04:32.360 Implement be implemented in your00:04:33.800 business you know Then followed with the00:04:35.800 chat GPT is the the the then the thing00:04:38.639 that's said and people don't really00:04:40.560 understand what's going on with that but00:04:42.360 one thing that I think that's really00:04:43.840 fascinating for me is that I as a00:04:46.120 content creator for many years have00:04:47.880 always been highly aware that these00:04:50.960 institutions these massive organizations00:04:53.039 the social media companies meta and00:04:55.199 Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok and00:04:57.400 Google and whatnot collect my data M and00:05:02.000 they collect it for their benefit Y and00:05:04.520 so that's the bit that I want to start00:05:06.360 out with you today okay I want to00:05:08.919 understand what you mean when you say00:05:11.759 they've got the data and it shouldn't be00:05:14.160 yours it should be yours yeah it's a00:05:16.360 really good point so when you when you00:05:18.120 think about what I think take a step00:05:19.880 back and ask yourself what data is00:05:22.080 that's the best place to start in a very00:05:23.600 non-technical way um I look at data as00:05:26.520 really our stories and our memories and00:05:28.960 our experiences so if you think about00:05:31.160 the photographs that you take the things00:05:33.440 that you want to keep they belong to you00:05:35.319 in a way but today they don't um you00:05:38.160 give them to others to look after um00:05:40.360 there's no insurance around what you00:05:41.720 hand over um so it could get lost at any00:05:44.199 moment um so if you start in that point00:05:46.400 and say okay if these are my stories and00:05:48.000 my memories how valuable are they to you00:05:51.039 because that's really where you should00:05:52.240 start and then you look at data in a00:05:54.240 very different way because today I think00:05:55.919 we've been brought up as you rightly say00:05:57.280 it's key to chat gbt um it's going to00:05:59.680 give you everything you want but if you00:06:01.360 break it down you know that's where you00:06:03.199 should start and say well actually data00:06:04.560 is personal to me and that's what it00:06:06.400 means and why shouldn't I own it um00:06:08.840 that's really the starting point in all00:06:10.120 of this so when we think about that then00:06:11.840 let's take some some some common example00:06:13.440 you say photographs so everything that00:06:15.919 that I produce as data so that can be00:06:19.039 stuff that I produce consciously but you00:06:21.199 know there'll be people that say I never00:06:22.400 use social media I don't produce data00:06:24.560 but for those people that think like00:06:26.120 that what type of data are they00:06:27.919 producing inadvertently that we can00:06:29.919 constitute in this conversation so think00:06:32.400 about how you got to the office this00:06:34.120 morning so Google Maps is a great00:06:36.199 example or any map software nopic on00:06:37.919 Google that journey to work generated00:06:40.479 data um unknown to you on your way to00:06:42.880 work you were00:06:44.080 commoditized because as you drive along00:06:46.960 people are now suddenly firing00:06:48.280 advertisements that you just say hey do00:06:49.680 you want to go to this place do you want00:06:50.759 to go to that place so even something as00:06:52.680 simple as driving to work is now making00:06:55.039 somebody else money but you never get00:06:57.000 access to that data yourself which you00:06:59.039 could have used for yourself um after00:07:01.400 the journey which is then you start00:07:03.680 thinking about it that way things start00:07:05.639 to get a bit more interesting because00:07:06.680 you start to ask yourself the question00:07:08.840 well what could I have done with that00:07:10.160 data if it was mine and why is it only00:07:12.680 being done this way okay that that's one00:07:16.000 of the big questions that we need to00:07:17.759 answer today give me some more examples00:07:20.759 that no not what you could do with it00:07:22.919 some examp like You' just given because00:07:24.199 I want to make sure that everyone's Can00:07:25.840 Be Touched by this so as soon as you00:07:27.759 just said that to me about Google Maps00:07:29.280 I'm like like I can go in and look at my00:07:31.000 map history and I can go and see all00:07:33.400 these different Journeys that I've taken00:07:35.080 even even if I've not put them into00:07:36.879 Google Maps corre so that that triggered00:07:40.000 me what give me another example of that00:07:41.919 so um even simple things like your Apple00:07:44.720 watch and things like that also think00:07:47.000 about it this way your data that you00:07:48.840 create is is often00:07:50.599 duplicated so for example if you own00:07:53.240 three devices I own an Apple Watch I own00:07:56.120 an Android phone all of these things I'm00:07:58.960 repeating the same data I can never00:08:00.599 connect it I can never pull it apart00:08:02.960 because it's living in different00:08:04.080 companies it's my data but it's00:08:06.159 separated so how many versions of you00:08:08.319 exist on a daily basis most people have00:08:10.159 about 100 passwords and don't realize it00:08:12.520 so your data is never connected which00:08:14.560 means you can never add to it which00:08:16.400 means you you're always repeating00:08:17.840 yourself almost so data is being sold00:08:20.639 constantly without you knowing behind00:08:22.159 the scenes but not only that you can't00:08:24.240 use it to solve your own problems let me00:08:26.199 explain to you what that means in very00:08:27.560 simple terms let's think about your00:08:29.120 health as a great example because we00:08:30.159 talked about this when we when we first00:08:31.599 met today not one person alive has a00:08:34.200 single view of their health um which00:08:36.519 means that we have all of these apps I00:08:38.120 have a whoop um a few people have an00:08:40.159 Apple Watch and so on but they're never00:08:41.559 connected they're never connected so it00:08:43.479 means we never get a really true picture00:08:45.880 of how our health is can we prevent00:08:47.839 things all of these things that we could00:08:49.640 if we owned our data and I think that's00:08:51.880 why ownership is really important00:08:53.320 because it's not about how much money I00:08:55.640 make from my data it's actually what it00:08:57.480 could mean for my life um how it could00:08:59.600 save my life um if I could connect that00:09:01.920 data myself wow okay so how do other00:09:05.920 companies use my data to make money this00:09:09.600 is like the hidden secret of the00:09:11.200 internet I think um and this kind of all00:09:13.519 started around 2003 um believe it or not00:09:16.399 in the marketing world Google bought00:09:18.440 AdSense and the internet before that was00:09:21.079 more of a library almost people00:09:23.120 connected communities so from like 200300:09:25.680 where we are today a lot of then the00:09:27.760 data that we produce got sold um most00:09:30.200 people don't realize the way that Amazon00:09:32.959 says to you well by the way do you want00:09:34.680 that diaper that follows you around all00:09:36.720 those websites is because your data is00:09:38.440 being sold behind the scenes through00:09:39.839 Brokers and various other companies who00:09:42.000 are selling data every second to people00:09:44.399 who want that and a connecting bits of00:09:46.680 you to basically create that picture and00:09:49.240 create Revenue which is either for00:09:51.160 advertising and marketing for that00:09:52.640 company or data that other people would00:09:55.120 gladly purchase so they can understand00:09:57.000 your behavior to try and sell you00:09:58.839 another product00:09:59.959 right so let's let's take that as an00:10:01.240 example I'm a father let's say and I've00:10:03.160 got young children and I buy diapers00:10:05.440 okay the the the people that sell the00:10:07.160 diapers want to advertise to me because00:10:09.200 I buy the diapers and they can only do00:10:11.240 that by buying uh by advertising using00:10:13.399 the data that's sold to them essentially00:10:15.120 by Facebook and and other companies like00:10:16.959 that yeah yeah and also use the example00:10:18.360 in America there's well-known story that00:10:20.399 a child a girl got pregnant and didn't00:10:22.279 want to tell her parents but Amazon knew00:10:23.880 before her parents yes they collected00:10:26.120 all of the data about her and then they00:10:27.720 told the DAT Amazon told told her and00:10:29.839 then her parents found out from Amazon00:10:31.560 not their daughter because of how much00:10:33.600 data look as as time progresses we have00:10:36.600 you and I know we're going to talk about00:10:37.720 this is we'll have more data about us00:10:39.959 which will then build an even bigger00:10:41.440 picture about us and the question then00:10:43.079 is how much more control do we want00:10:45.120 about that because how personal it00:10:46.440 starts to become okay well this this for00:10:49.000 many people could be scary okay could be00:10:51.360 frightening first of all frightening the00:10:52.920 other people are using my data and I00:10:55.320 just take some simple examples that I'm00:10:57.160 sure that one or two viewers and00:10:58.720 listeners might be aware of an00:11:00.720 inappropriate photo yeah 100% you know00:11:03.079 an inappropriate photo of something00:11:05.240 intimate between you and your your wife00:11:06.839 or your husband that that piece of data00:11:09.040 you wouldn't want anybody else to see00:11:10.639 want but but actually there's lots of00:11:13.399 organizations that have access to it00:11:15.320 100% um that goes on on a daily basis um00:11:18.760 I use a term which is a bit00:11:19.880 controversial the way data storage is00:11:21.720 today is like unregulated00:11:23.279 banking um just give me let me sh me out00:11:26.240 and give you that comparison so today if00:11:28.240 I put 200 Durham or $20000 into a bank00:11:31.839 the bank insures me for that um they're00:11:34.519 also told what they can do with it00:11:36.320 usually is about 10 times the monetary00:11:37.839 value they can lend out and there's00:11:39.560 obviously other regulations and things00:11:41.000 and I can get it when I want subject to00:11:42.760 proving my identity and other factors if00:11:45.079 you think about your photographs today00:11:46.920 you will upload those but you're not00:11:48.920 insured if they're00:11:50.880 lost um and there are some privacy00:11:53.120 controls in terms of what these00:11:54.480 companies are allowed to do but they00:11:56.279 still can do other things if you commit00:11:57.959 and give your consent so the data00:11:59.760 related to those photographs can be used00:12:01.560 for monetization um and then afterwards00:12:04.040 then as long as you can prove who you00:12:05.200 are but sometimes they will lock you out00:12:06.560 anyway because you didn't give enough00:12:08.120 proof maybe you changed location that's00:12:09.800 happened to me personally so I always00:12:11.760 make the question what would be more00:12:12.920 important to you if your bank lost $20000:12:16.160 or a cloud provider lost 20 years of00:12:18.600 your00:12:19.440 photographs what would be more important00:12:21.279 to you now that's why I now think data00:12:24.639 is important to Everyday Life as water00:12:27.040 and I think data is more important than00:12:28.440 money because of that simple fact if you00:12:31.199 lost 20 years of your entire family00:12:33.320 because of mistake of a cloud provider00:12:35.320 with no insurance that would mean more00:12:37.320 to you personally I think than to any00:12:39.240 amount of money on this Earth good point00:12:42.639 okay so we know that these external00:12:45.639 organizations are monetizing the data00:12:47.680 that that they're gathering on us you00:12:49.959 you your essentially your belief is that00:12:53.720 you want to stop that and allow us to00:12:55.680 have the ownership of our own00:12:57.720 data so yes and no so um one is about00:13:01.839 Fair rewards so basically but I also00:13:05.240 want us to stop thinking about00:13:06.440 monetizing00:13:07.600 data because if we think of monetization00:13:10.399 of data as the answer to everything then00:13:12.399 that's we're losing sight of the power00:13:13.800 of data I think when you and I first met00:13:16.000 I use the term I think data is potential00:13:18.680 um because that's the other way I look00:13:19.760 at data it's the potential to innovate00:13:21.360 it's the potential to save lives and yes00:13:22.880 we'll make money from data but if that's00:13:24.959 our only lens on this then we're all00:13:27.079 missing out because I would even AR that00:13:29.680 even the ones today that make the money00:13:31.120 off our data have all missed out because00:13:33.720 they don't have a single view of our00:13:34.839 life they only have a version of our00:13:36.880 life so they can Amazon can only see my00:13:38.920 Amazon life they have no idea what I00:13:40.920 watch on Netflix for example so they're00:13:43.160 only building a version of me that they00:13:44.880 know so my argument is that if Apple00:13:48.519 could see all of my data and I allowed00:13:50.759 them to have it because I owned it it00:13:52.519 could be worth even more than they are00:13:53.839 today because they can give me utilities00:13:56.759 um to manage my health for example which00:13:58.360 connect all that data which we don't00:13:59.800 have today but also I could create my00:14:01.920 own utilities that help me manage my00:14:03.759 health or other things and yes of course00:14:05.639 I'll monetize my data which is a big00:14:07.720 part of the AI story today um where we00:14:10.079 know that a lot of people's data has00:14:11.480 being used to build AI without their00:14:13.000 knowledge but my argument is well we00:14:15.880 need Ai and AI needs us and a big part00:14:18.199 of that is also a fair reward for how00:14:20.199 our data has been used to create Ai and00:14:22.399 constantly how it's used so it's a00:14:23.839 mixture of the people who take our data00:14:26.639 today also getting benefit but more me00:14:29.440 as a consumer I also get a benefit00:14:31.720 because now what I'm using is a00:14:33.440 reflection of how unique I am and who I00:14:36.000 am rather than a generic view of00:14:38.959 myself if if you if if we take00:14:41.160 monetization and just park it for one00:14:42.759 minute and and and look at how those00:14:44.360 other companies use the data they're00:14:45.920 using the data so that it can be00:14:48.279 effective in certain ways the thing the00:14:49.839 thing that kind of resonates I'm curious00:14:51.519 about now is Health okay because that's00:14:54.880 the one thing that's the most important00:14:56.199 thing to all of us although some of us00:14:57.639 seem to be on a a mission of death a lot00:14:59.639 of the time um that bit that you said00:15:02.839 resonates me you you wear a whoop you00:15:04.560 know I wear a Garin and and and you've00:15:06.759 got your Apple watch and these two00:15:08.199 devices aren't talking to each other and00:15:10.279 that's just these two that are on your00:15:11.720 wrist let alone um all of the other00:15:14.399 information that's gathered about your00:15:16.040 health in different ways how can how can00:15:19.040 what you're proposing how can that help00:15:22.680 me so let me probably give a really I'm00:15:26.800 always open and honest with my my00:15:28.360 audience so recently um I was told you00:15:31.360 know you're at the age Spencer but you00:15:32.880 need to have a thumb put up your bum so00:15:34.639 that you can check your00:15:36.319 colon all right and I was like I00:15:38.360 probably been hearing that for five or00:15:39.759 six years and then someone who's a bit00:15:42.279 older than me a friend of mine he said00:15:43.800 to me said you need to get it done okay00:15:45.639 A friend of mine got sick he had some00:15:47.199 cancer blah blah blah you know you need00:15:48.480 to go and get it checked and so I was um00:15:51.440 I was reticent to go as I think most men00:15:53.519 are but I but I eventually conceded and00:15:55.720 went to the hospital here and um had a00:15:57.920 camera put where it shouldn't go and uh00:16:00.279 uh the work that was done to find out00:16:01.680 that I was all00:16:04.600 good that information00:16:07.639 there has impact on other information on00:16:11.160 other parts of my body and other parts00:16:12.600 of Health okay cancer is something that00:16:15.959 spreads into other parts of our body as00:16:17.560 an example when we when we own our own00:16:20.920 data are you suggesting that we're able00:16:24.319 essentially to combine all of this00:16:26.079 different information from the hospital00:16:28.000 that I went to here the American00:16:29.360 Hospital so the one five year or 1000:16:30.880 years ago I had my spinal surgery in00:16:32.560 London um to to the one where I had my00:16:35.279 my my clavicle done and the metal plate00:16:37.000 put in there when I fell off my bike at00:16:38.600 the medic Medicare place here um is it00:16:42.360 just Gathering all of that together and00:16:44.279 putting it in a place where there's that00:16:46.360 can be then read and understood and00:16:48.639 further diagnosis can be done to00:16:50.720 optimize my health correct and this is00:16:52.560 where the AI story comes in okay so00:16:55.240 today we've been told a narrative that00:16:57.160 AI is better than us right a lot of the00:16:59.360 narrative because it's created a divide00:17:01.000 in society right we have to admit that00:17:03.319 there's parts of the world that think00:17:04.480 it's going to solve everything we've00:17:06.000 ever had a problem with there's the00:17:07.760 other half of the world that are rightly00:17:08.959 concerned and think we're going to lose00:17:10.119 our jobs the reality is I think we're00:17:12.240 moving into an era of collaborative00:17:14.039 collaborative AI where humans and AI00:17:16.319 will work together but on people's own00:17:18.520 data so let's take your example um I00:17:21.760 work out quite a lot so when I first met00:17:23.799 my PT she knows nothing about me she00:17:26.160 only knows what I tell her yeah and then00:17:28.039 we figure that out through the sessions00:17:30.640 um it's lucky that she specializes in00:17:32.200 biomechanics so she can actually figure00:17:33.799 out as she goes along but wouldn't it be00:17:35.919 useful if you took all of that data that00:17:38.120 you've just collected and then you could00:17:40.120 show her where your injuries are what00:17:42.600 you have and then all a sudden then you00:17:44.160 get an excise program that's taken for00:17:45.679 you even your AI could probably say to00:17:48.480 you on all your data um hey Spencer um I00:17:51.760 can see all these injuries I can see00:17:53.200 bits about your nutrition maybe you want00:17:55.200 to think about XYZ because the reality00:17:57.559 is AI is not going to queue at cancer00:17:59.760 but with your own data might be able to00:18:01.360 prevent it because through predictions00:18:03.880 and patterns and past examples in your00:18:06.400 life I can bring all that data together00:18:08.400 and suddenly I have a different picture00:18:09.799 of you and this is the really important00:18:11.600 bit the way the AI is being developed00:18:13.520 today is trying to treat everybody the00:18:14.679 same with the way it reports and gives00:18:17.000 you Insight the reality is we're all00:18:18.480 unique the story you've just said is00:18:20.320 unique to you yeah so in a way only you00:18:23.360 can really self diagnose if because00:18:25.840 basically you'd have to go and see all00:18:26.919 of those doctors individually m someone00:18:29.440 who's amazing to piece that story00:18:31.120 together um but if you had all your data00:18:33.159 and AI was there all of a sudden now00:18:35.120 that story changes because what it's00:18:37.159 giving you advice on is what makes you00:18:39.440 unique which is those life events and00:18:41.799 that data effectively and we've00:18:44.039 established clearly now in the world not00:18:47.280 everybody's the same we know that people00:18:48.880 are different and so the same exercise00:18:50.440 program nutrition program or whatever it00:18:52.120 may be is not going to work on everyone00:18:54.400 how does how does that00:18:56.240 that how does that then get translated00:18:59.520 because if it's Gathering that00:19:00.679 information and it's suggesting it how00:19:03.200 is it suggesting it and and you know is00:19:05.000 it is it then providing that information00:19:06.960 to a holistic doctor that then says00:19:08.720 right I've understood everything now00:19:11.000 based upon all this information that's00:19:12.280 been gathered over the last 54 years of00:19:13.880 your life spener this is the direction00:19:16.039 you need to head in or is that going to00:19:17.600 be something that that that that that00:19:19.120 allows us to understand it so that we00:19:21.240 can then plan with it so this this opens00:19:23.200 up another question or at least an area00:19:25.480 of focus so a lot of the work that I've00:19:28.400 been doing doing in this space and it00:19:30.400 dawned on me that we also don't yet have00:19:33.240 the skills needed to interpret what AI00:19:35.080 is going to give us and and some of00:19:37.440 that's not our fault that's just our00:19:39.520 dependency on technology over time so we00:19:42.240 have to reason with ourselves and00:19:43.960 understand that we become visual00:19:45.559 thinkers um the average person now00:19:47.840 apparently has an attention span of 800:19:49.559 seconds um the last big attacks in terms00:19:52.240 of where people's data was stolen was00:19:54.320 because of human error um and data00:19:56.559 literacy is the worst it's ever been so00:19:59.280 the the real value of ownership of data00:20:00.960 and I would argue treating data like an00:20:02.440 asset would mean children are now00:20:04.679 educated on how to read it how to think00:20:06.840 critically how to debate how to reason00:20:09.400 so that's the other reason that00:20:10.679 ownership of data is really important00:20:12.280 because then we will teach people how to00:20:14.440 read it um so look you're not I'm not00:20:16.720 saying you're going to replace your00:20:17.840 doctor but at least some of these things00:20:19.919 may give you advice which are not00:20:21.799 life-threatening and there will be a00:20:23.360 moment where we say well actually you00:20:24.559 probably should see a doctor because of00:20:26.559 what I can see but also your past00:20:28.080 history but you know what the thing the00:20:30.360 thing that sticks out for me more than00:20:31.799 anything else is is the whole preventing00:20:33.880 correct you know for me it's like if if00:20:36.360 people00:20:37.559 knew that they this data could help them00:20:41.360 prevent yeah getting cancer which00:20:43.559 impacts one in two people one or two00:20:45.120 women anyway um on this planet that that00:20:49.679 that00:20:52.760 literally will save more lives than a00:20:55.320 war on or apocalypse would ever take let00:20:57.520 me give you a real good example I met00:20:59.360 this lady on a plane I'm I'm sure she00:21:00.720 will remind me telling this story um I00:21:03.480 got in a plane and there was a lady00:21:05.039 opposite me very sitting in a very00:21:06.240 uncomfortable position um I she had00:21:08.360 pillows and towels and things and I00:21:10.279 asked her we got talking and I said why00:21:12.240 are you sat like that she said back00:21:13.679 cancer I said how did you find that out00:21:16.159 and she broke her back in the gym00:21:17.919 training um which was unusual because00:21:20.039 she was so young so the doctor analyzed00:21:22.480 unfortunately you've got back cancer and00:21:23.880 you're stage four right months and00:21:27.200 months and months later shakula00:21:29.400 doctors don't know how a mixture of what00:21:32.120 she thought she should do with medical00:21:34.520 advice but whatever it did it worked00:21:37.559 she's a life coach so I asked her I said00:21:39.640 well what did you do she said well I00:21:41.360 can't remember really but because I'm a00:21:43.240 life coach now people now want me to00:21:44.679 help them in a similar position and I00:21:46.880 said to her well if you owned your data00:21:49.720 you could have collected everything that00:21:51.039 you did and then wouldn't it be amazing00:21:53.799 if you could share that value with00:21:55.000 someone else you take your data set and00:21:57.520 you give it to someone who's got the00:21:58.720 same as you and their AI combines their00:22:01.480 data with your data and suddenly they00:22:03.760 find the answer that's unique to that00:22:05.840 individual based on your learnings and00:22:08.000 who's to say you then give that to a00:22:10.159 pharmaceutical company who then instead00:22:12.200 of generating a pill they generate00:22:15.000 everybody an algorithm so that everybody00:22:17.200 then can follow that and manage their00:22:18.440 own health in a similar condition that's00:22:20.720 what we're talking about we have enough00:22:22.679 data in the world and enough technology00:22:25.080 now to get us to a place where if we00:22:27.200 treat data like an asset we could00:22:29.440 prevent much more than just the health00:22:33.880 side00:22:36.200 wow but wow with a which begs the00:22:39.679 question why has this not already00:22:42.880 happened it makes me makes me feel sad00:22:45.799 that something as as as remarkable and00:22:48.880 impactful as that that there there are00:22:51.960 so many more things in the world that00:22:53.279 we're spending time money and effort on00:22:54.760 right now but that seems to me as like00:22:57.480 the biggest game changer the planet00:22:59.120 could ever face it's a it's a history00:23:01.679 that's often been Untold um we've I've00:23:04.880 sold it wow that's massive though isn't00:23:08.120 it it is I as I just start and process00:23:10.960 that I mean it's like that if you could00:23:14.159 actually do that so if you take that to00:23:16.080 its full end degree with the technology00:23:18.480 we're having now when you're born I00:23:20.679 could give you a digital twin of view00:23:23.120 and I could AB test you based on your00:23:25.520 own data and what your parents inherited00:23:27.360 to you as a piece of data so if you were00:23:29.200 born with diabetes for example and your00:23:31.559 parents had diabetes or one of them00:23:33.360 throughout their life and they pass on00:23:35.360 that data belongs to them so they would00:23:37.520 give it to you as an inheritance and00:23:40.240 then you could run that on the AI which00:23:42.039 could be 20 years later digital twin00:23:44.200 technology exist where you can take a00:23:45.679 replica of a machine today I could take00:23:47.400 a replica R you and then use the same00:23:49.799 data to see what medication would work00:23:51.360 before I even give it to you that's a00:23:53.400 10year vision that is completely00:23:55.320 possible um but again you've got to00:23:57.640 start with not the technology and this00:23:59.559 goes back to your question why don't we00:24:00.919 have it now is because our focus is in00:24:03.039 the wrong place we see the technology as00:24:05.880 the answer but the real power has been00:24:07.480 there all along which is the data the00:24:09.799 identity and the value it00:24:11.760 generates so the more we SP Focus Less00:24:14.559 on technology and more on data what I'm00:24:17.400 describing is just literally scratching00:24:19.480 the surface health is just one example00:24:21.880 you you go on and on in terms of what we00:24:23.640 can see because the other problem is00:24:26.399 Spencer we've been brought up to believe00:24:27.720 that data means00:24:28.880 monetization but actually data is a00:24:31.000 utility and a store value at exactly the00:24:33.000 same time what does that mean well one I00:24:35.000 can use it to make money for myself if00:24:36.919 an AI uses my algorithm I'll get paid00:24:38.760 many times over which is great but the00:24:40.799 other amazing thing for me is I can use00:24:43.440 the create utilities I've just00:24:45.440 described um imagine you've got an AI00:24:47.720 with your data and suddenly it says to00:24:49.720 you Spencer you can see you've got a00:24:51.080 health app but you're missing some data00:24:53.240 that would help you why don't you go to00:24:55.000 a hike in some far off country you rest00:24:59.080 but you'll collect dat that's really00:25:00.600 valuable to others and you and you could00:25:03.240 sell that on an exchange and make some00:25:05.120 money for yourself but at the same time00:25:07.120 it would build a bigger picture of your00:25:08.520 health but improve your cardiovascular00:25:10.799 system it's like sold why wouldn't you00:25:13.760 yeah absolutely yeah gee man it's just00:25:18.000 like it's so exciting it's like it's00:25:22.159 like okay a lot of time a lot of time00:25:25.320 it's always about how can it be00:25:27.279 implemented okay you know what what are00:25:29.120 the practical steps of being implemented00:25:31.120 so I know that you've put some thought00:25:32.720 into this that's why you're sat here00:25:34.120 today but um tell me what when you had00:25:37.799 these realizations and the were these00:25:39.559 moments for you big moments like they00:25:41.159 are for as I'm listening to it now they00:25:42.919 they were yeah so so the story with this00:25:44.799 goes back four years I was asked to00:25:46.360 write a paper a very long time ago on00:25:48.520 what the future of data would be in 203000:25:51.279 and I I kind of had those he in the00:25:52.760 moment you know here standing up moments00:25:54.320 in a room where it's was like it dawned00:25:56.279 on me this was much more important that00:25:57.960 I'd be asked to do um but it also dawned00:26:01.760 on me we need to do more um and we need00:26:05.600 to know more about this and that's kind00:26:07.640 of what started the journey I think we00:26:09.399 all have these moments where we find00:26:10.919 something or we start something and it00:26:12.320 gets bigger than ourselves this is what00:26:14.320 it became so yeah they then what I'm00:26:16.760 doing and what I've been have done is00:26:19.279 doing exactly what you just asked which00:26:21.000 is the steps to get there either for a00:26:23.080 government to put this in place so some00:26:25.080 of these longer term or even near term00:26:26.840 Things become a reality00:26:28.960 but also what are the fundamental things00:26:31.559 that we need in this but also not00:26:32.919 forgetting the role that people play in00:26:34.279 all of this which I think is close to00:26:36.159 your heart everyone we met as well00:26:37.399 talking about people and organizations00:26:38.960 and their roles and I'm sure we'll come00:26:40.919 on to that is their importance in it so00:26:42.799 yeah the the the steps are really00:26:44.039 important I can go through some of those00:26:45.840 if absolutely we need to go I want to be00:26:48.880 I want make sure everybody not only sits00:26:51.039 there and has just done what I've done00:26:52.480 as you've explained what you explained00:26:53.760 but you know what are these what are00:26:55.440 these moves that we need to make so if00:26:57.200 you think about so what makes ownership00:26:59.000 possible obviously starts with the00:27:00.720 regulator and the government um I'm00:27:03.279 fortunate to be living in Dubai and I00:27:04.919 can have those conversations and it's00:27:07.640 exciting and it probably won't surprise00:27:09.600 you how open they are to those00:27:11.240 conversations the first step in anything00:27:13.080 is recognizing people's legal right to00:27:14.600 own their data that's that's the first00:27:15.960 big tick um we mustn't underestimate the00:27:18.480 role of your identity with that because00:27:20.399 you are your data and that's how you00:27:21.760 prove yourself so those two are00:27:23.559 critically important I think then00:27:25.480 there's the awareness like this podcast00:27:27.799 is giv people that awareness but I think00:27:29.880 then regulators and other organizations00:27:31.520 then will have to make people aware of00:27:32.880 what that means in the near term people00:27:35.520 can help themselves um they can actually00:27:38.600 think more clearly about what they do00:27:40.279 with their data in the short term maybe00:27:42.360 work with companies where they can00:27:43.720 access their data and use it themselves00:27:46.600 um and just become more Curious over00:27:48.840 time some of the work I'm doing is00:27:50.679 helping build the curriculums for00:27:52.320 schools in terms of how children now can00:27:54.519 become critical thinkers again and learn00:27:57.080 to reason so then they will be in a00:27:58.720 position to actually use their data with00:28:00.480 an AI in the right way um but the00:28:03.480 biggest thing you know that's what you00:28:04.519 can do as individual and that's what00:28:05.600 needs to be done at a government level00:28:07.200 there's a raft of technology behind all00:28:08.919 of this I'm very fortunate to be working00:28:10.600 with people on those um but yeah that's00:28:12.679 your starting point one is educate00:28:14.200 yourself and build an awareness of these00:28:16.360 things and also ask yourself the00:28:18.200 question why and what could I do and the00:28:20.279 second part of the equation is00:28:21.320 unfortunately we can't do anything until00:28:23.279 the government gives us a helping hand00:28:24.720 and that's part of the work that I'm00:28:25.720 doing when you talk to governments about00:28:27.919 a subject matter like this do they00:28:30.039 immediately jump on it and say we get it00:28:32.039 we understand it we want to try and do00:28:33.440 something about it or do you get um for00:28:36.360 obvious reasons I would suspect push00:28:38.240 back a little bit of push back but00:28:40.399 that's only because I think the way that00:28:42.760 we've been taught what data is so we've00:28:46.080 touched on that we've been taught data00:28:47.640 is monetization we've also been taught00:28:49.880 that data is00:28:50.960 fear which is where data privacy comes00:28:53.320 from yeah so people have been I guess00:28:56.279 told it's scary to share your look after00:28:58.799 it don't use it so then we constantly00:29:01.679 have privacy rules when actually that's00:29:03.320 probably not the answer the answer is00:29:05.440 now ownership in Choice which is the00:29:07.600 conversation I have with the regulator00:29:09.000 to say look let's be realistic we're00:29:11.279 going to have an AI fairly soon that no00:29:13.080 one's ever going to be able to keep up00:29:14.200 with they the regulator so do we00:29:16.559 actually then say maybe there's a00:29:18.320 different model which is we give people00:29:20.399 the ownership and choice we give them00:29:21.799 the technology to do that and maybe the00:29:24.080 regulator then shifts their attention to00:29:25.679 what really matters which is security00:29:27.159 and ethics and then the game changes but00:29:30.320 then more importantly you talk to the00:29:31.720 regulator around look this isn't about00:29:33.720 monetization this is about giving people00:29:35.279 the things they've never had I would00:29:36.679 even argue what even businesses have00:29:38.480 never had and if you bring this into00:29:41.640 fruition you will open up innovation in00:29:43.919 a national level National level because00:29:46.320 you will now invite fex companies who00:29:49.399 will help people and businesses use data00:29:52.159 in the way that I'm describing so you00:29:53.840 create an ecosystem and an economy00:29:55.399 around this that's why it's exciting for00:29:57.320 the regulator because now you create a00:29:58.799 culture of innovation but also you00:30:00.919 create a new Workforce you build the00:30:03.760 Next Generation and you almost build you00:30:06.000 know the underpinnings of of a new way00:30:11.200 forward how cool is00:30:13.480 that talk to me about how you link the00:30:16.360 blockchain with the ambition here00:30:19.080 because I think that and again let's00:30:20.519 just make sure that there'll be there'll00:30:22.000 be people here that don't understand00:30:23.159 really what the blockchain has said I00:30:24.519 don't want to jump too too deep into00:30:26.679 that but I want people to to understand00:30:29.240 the connection because we just had uh in00:30:31.440 the Press yesterday uh an announcement00:30:33.840 that M2 is going to allow people to um00:30:37.360 uh trade trade their uh ethereum and00:30:39.919 Bitcoin in their local currency in their00:30:41.919 bank accounts here the government of Abu00:30:43.519 Dhabi have just to authorize that which00:30:45.519 I think will you know less and more and00:30:49.640 more take people to less and less fear00:30:51.480 around the whole world of crypto because00:30:53.760 it's becoming normalized and we heard00:30:55.720 what Trump's saying if he gets back into00:30:57.159 Power what he's going to do as well so00:30:59.159 that's I I hope bringing more people00:31:01.159 into this place of not thinking that you00:31:03.559 know crypto is some crazy nutty scam and00:31:06.320 and the blockchain and web3 is uh is00:31:08.279 Bonkers so just in really simple terms00:31:11.880 how are you doing what you're doing00:31:13.600 there so you've used the magic words so00:31:15.799 bit Bonkers no that is also a magic word00:31:18.360 because you haveed Bonkers to put the00:31:19.559 pieces together um so Bitcoin and00:31:22.639 ethereum I look at data as the brother00:31:25.080 and sister of both of them because00:31:27.240 Bitcoin is a story value MH ethereum is00:31:29.880 programmable data is00:31:31.960 both so what if you made data a00:31:34.679 token itself and what if you could store00:31:38.039 it on a ledger in terms of every time00:31:40.440 it's used who has it because that's00:31:42.039 really what the blockchain is right it's00:31:43.279 a mutable record of something that was00:31:45.760 stored in a ledger like in the olden00:31:48.000 days where we'd have a be some you know00:31:49.480 Ledger ins and outs big books big books00:31:51.760 right the lines in exactly now now now00:31:53.799 it's digital um and the currency is is00:31:56.720 is data uh my argument is the currency00:31:59.279 now is intelligence because actually00:32:01.600 what we're sharing is knowledge and I00:32:03.240 can tokenize it and I can store in a00:32:05.320 blockchain okay so let's let's just Dum00:32:07.440 that down a little bit okay tokenize it00:32:09.720 so we can create a a Bitcoin 2.0 or we00:32:12.799 can we can whatever we want to call it00:32:14.919 okay let's let's call it let's call it00:32:17.200 whatever we want but it essentially00:32:19.120 becomes its very own token that sits00:32:22.559 alongside all of the other tokens as as00:32:24.760 an asset that you can buy and trade and00:32:28.720 that that data itself then each each00:32:31.919 piece of data is owned by whoever the00:32:33.559 owner is correct and his access for a00:32:35.639 wallet that you hold the word asset00:32:38.639 though is what you said is really00:32:39.919 important um because a lot of the work00:32:42.000 I'm doing is making data into a real00:32:43.639 world asset so treating it like water so00:32:47.600 if you think of the outage that happened00:32:49.159 a few weeks ago or a week ago now isn't00:32:50.880 it um where you know major system change00:32:54.120 for the first time I guess locked us all00:32:55.880 out of our computers okay so the so for00:32:58.360 people that that aren't familiar with it00:32:59.919 here in the world recently if you're00:33:01.720 under under a rock we had they said00:33:04.639 someone turned a switch or fress a00:33:06.039 button somewhere in a cyber security00:33:07.639 company I foret Cloud strike I think it00:33:09.799 was and and basically many many people00:33:13.360 shops couldn't use their terminals to00:33:15.120 take payments and you know all kinds of00:33:17.639 computer systems crashed what that00:33:19.519 showed to me and I hope it showed to the00:33:21.519 world is that data is now as more00:33:23.480 important as life as long as water00:33:26.200 because because we couldn't access data00:33:27.960 because we couldn't use it in our jobs00:33:29.720 all of a sudden the world stopped right00:33:31.919 because really what the computer was was00:33:33.240 just a device to create and show a state00:33:36.320 so when we start saying well data is an00:33:38.720 asset and you ask me blockchain and00:33:40.880 token the real value is when it becomes00:33:43.159 a real world asset because now everybody00:33:44.840 touches that data becomes a critical00:33:46.480 service00:33:48.440 provider they become regulated in terms00:33:50.799 of how they handle and manage data like00:33:52.360 the water company so I can't imagine the00:33:55.000 water company ever having a crisis like00:33:56.679 that and nobody ever been able to drink00:33:58.440 water in in a development bills it's the00:34:00.840 same thing he would just put extra00:34:02.399 layers of Regulation and the companies00:34:04.519 that store your data today would also be00:34:06.360 treated as a regulated entity so then00:34:08.599 all of a sudden then you've got a00:34:10.440 technology that allows you to move data00:34:12.199 around securely and safely and makes it00:34:14.079 traceable which is what we're talking00:34:15.440 about but also then the companies and00:34:17.480 the facilitator and look after for you00:34:19.399 are also treated as critical service00:34:21.119 providers so everything then changes00:34:23.839 because then you look at data then as00:34:25.399 not something that belongs in a system00:34:27.399 but it's it's actually critical to00:34:28.760 everything that we do you know for your00:34:30.560 listeners have a think about when you00:34:32.159 had breakfast this morning to when you00:34:33.440 went to bed how many things did you00:34:35.239 touch gave you data the screen you00:34:37.399 looked at the alarm clock in the morning00:34:38.960 that's digital all of those things are00:34:40.800 data really and they become so important00:34:43.119 to everyday life that we've lost sight00:34:45.239 of it which is why the technology allows00:34:47.679 us to make this possible but at the same00:34:49.800 time the regulation then allows us to00:34:51.320 change our00:34:53.800 mindset can I want to I want to get back00:34:56.040 to getting to some some kind of like mic00:34:58.200 drop moments here so we can we can get00:35:00.240 people that might have got a little bit00:35:02.119 confused by that excited again we talked00:35:03.880 about health yeah okay what a g give me00:35:06.200 some other give me some other fun00:35:07.720 examples of where where our audience00:35:10.160 right now will S I didn't know it could00:35:12.200 do that that would be cool for me if it00:35:14.119 could do this give me a couple of00:35:15.359 examples around that kind of stuff so00:35:17.400 let's go let s Finance okay um so00:35:20.280 there's a few things one I actually00:35:21.359 really want to do I'm kind of giving it00:35:22.760 do I give this away give it away I don't00:35:24.680 G to do anything with it I think you00:35:26.520 could build a data Bond what's a data00:35:28.560 Bond so in in financial terms you can00:35:30.359 you can invest in a bond yeah so this is00:35:32.440 basically where a government or an00:35:33.680 organization wants to wants to borrow00:35:35.240 money so say they're building a property00:35:37.920 um or even a group of properties they00:35:39.800 would issue a bond and they'll collect00:35:41.400 the money from people who will then get00:35:43.400 make money out of that property00:35:44.839 development over time the interest rate00:35:47.079 is usually fixed Y and they M them once00:35:49.280 that that Bond matures everybody gets00:35:50.839 their money out I think everyone00:35:52.920 understands that simply essentially is a00:35:54.640 loan okay someone's making a loan to00:35:56.599 somebody at a fixed rate of interest and00:35:58.240 the person that's making the loan isn't00:35:59.480 going to lend the money themselves00:36:00.480 they're going to let everybody else come00:36:01.520 in and be part of that lending that00:36:03.200 amount of money being lent so everyone00:36:04.920 can share in that return correct okay so00:36:07.040 it could be a Government Bond could be a00:36:08.319 corporate bond okay so what's a data00:36:10.560 Bond exactly the same thing so the00:36:12.760 government says do you know what we need00:36:14.400 some data to do something maybe the data00:36:16.640 is important to understand an area in00:36:19.000 Dubai that people may have that data or00:36:21.280 maybe they're trying to build something00:36:22.319 to do with house and they're trying to00:36:24.240 the impact of cocoa pops who knows00:36:28.200 or maybe it's a research company trying00:36:29.800 to build you know some medication m and00:36:32.319 they need they need the data of people00:36:33.800 they can't get today people may have a00:36:35.400 unique allergies or certain things00:36:37.200 because take covid right even though the00:36:39.119 the medication was heavily tested00:36:41.240 there's always going to be outliers00:36:42.920 because you just don't have enough00:36:44.359 testing data to prove but could you00:36:46.800 issue a bond to say actually instead of00:36:49.319 trying to take this data from people why00:36:51.400 don't you contribute and every time and00:36:53.839 then every as we're building this you00:36:55.240 will get rewarded every time your data00:36:56.599 is used this is why it's so cool in a00:36:59.560 bond I get paid once because it's only00:37:01.680 for the property but that same data00:37:03.200 could get used seven times or more or00:37:05.839 more which means I get rewarded every00:37:08.000 time and the government could even take00:37:09.839 a clip of that take some money off that00:37:11.839 as a as a as a revenue generator so the00:37:14.400 government's making money government's00:37:15.960 getting data they need and everybody00:37:17.480 else is getting rewarded at the same00:37:18.680 time how is that data for for the00:37:21.760 average Joe guy goes to work every day00:37:23.640 works at KPMG just become partner wife00:37:25.920 works as I don't know whatever another00:37:28.000 business she's an accountant let's say00:37:29.319 as well and they live a normal life they00:37:31.839 got two kids they live in Arabian00:37:33.200 ranches or wherever it may be they they00:37:34.839 a very normal life how does that that00:37:37.160 man that's sitting listening to this00:37:38.640 right now going holy macaroni this00:37:40.640 sounds cool how does he then consciously00:37:43.839 is he able to harvest and harness his00:37:46.400 own data so he will today is going be00:37:49.520 difficult right let's be H let's be00:37:50.520 honest there'll be certain data that he00:37:51.760 can't get if we use the examples of00:37:53.640 government with healths that's a lot00:37:55.720 desperate today there may be some things00:37:57.800 though that on your Apple watch and00:37:59.000 device you can be able to get yourself00:38:01.319 um could be your step count could be00:38:02.880 your heart rate or anything that makes00:38:04.200 you unique that could easily be given00:38:06.480 today um and all it would take is a is a00:38:09.240 bank to issue a bond I think in Dubai00:38:10.920 they've just done social bonds um00:38:13.119 there's no reason why you couldn't do00:38:14.119 one for data um so what it starts to do00:38:17.720 is starts and this is why I hope this00:38:19.680 happens with people listening they start00:38:22.040 looking at the data and questioning what00:38:23.640 that data means and is it valuable and00:38:26.000 more importantly is it valuable to them00:38:28.560 before but is it is it not a case of of00:38:30.880 some00:38:32.040 people will listen to this and go yeah00:38:34.280 this is really valuable but I don't even00:38:36.160 know where to start where where is where00:38:37.839 is my data you00:38:39.520 know and it may be this is the infancy00:38:42.160 and that's what you're bringing bringing00:38:43.319 to the world but but you know as we can00:38:47.800 clearly currently we can store our00:38:49.880 cryptocurrency on an exchange or we can00:38:51.680 store in a store in a cold wallet right00:38:54.160 um and so we've got those two options so00:38:56.920 for those people people that don't know00:38:57.880 what a cold storage is just think of a00:38:59.560 USB stick it's like it's the easiest way00:39:01.319 to describe it you put it on a USB stick00:39:02.960 and you put the USB in your pocket00:39:05.440 so for for those people wanting to be00:39:08.200 able to to harness it there will come a00:39:11.040 time in the not too dist future where00:39:12.800 they can literally every piece of data00:39:15.440 that they produce can be collected in an00:39:17.680 automated fashion and go into their00:39:20.520 storage facility of that and that's when00:39:23.480 they're going to have the power over it00:39:24.960 there'll be companies so there are00:39:26.800 companies that exist already so this is00:39:29.040 not like the fantasy of someone writing00:39:30.760 this the cool bit is I get the chance to00:39:32.200 work with people doing it yeah so00:39:33.760 there's a company I work with in silic00:39:35.359 and Valley who are building a data00:39:36.520 wallet where basically you'll be able to00:39:38.680 do exactly what I've just described they00:39:40.119 launch pretty soon where you'll be able00:39:41.960 to store your data and have a savings uh00:39:44.800 product capturing the rewards and value00:39:47.160 from your data um there are already00:39:49.400 companies on the internet where you can00:39:50.920 pull all your data together in a00:39:52.480 community mhm and every time that data00:39:54.680 is sold you get rewarded every time that00:39:56.880 data is used us so they could pull that00:39:58.720 data together and maybe sell it on like00:40:00.960 an app store or something like that a00:40:02.280 Marketplace that people would be00:40:03.280 familiar with they already exist by the00:40:05.599 by the way ex that like a Cooperative00:40:07.280 basically exactly exactly that so those00:40:09.680 exist today there's wallets that exist00:40:11.280 today there are companies in Saudi00:40:13.160 Arabia building what I'm describing for00:40:16.119 health um where people can actually00:40:17.920 manage their own health data and do that00:40:20.160 um there are already other companies in00:40:21.760 web 3 world which allow people to take00:40:23.680 their data that they store on the00:40:24.640 internet there's even browsers today00:40:25.920 like Brave and others that tell you and00:40:28.160 block advertising if you to look after00:40:30.319 your data so this is emerging and the00:40:32.560 biggest move that happened last year00:40:34.160 which listeners will not know is that00:40:36.440 Brazil is the first country in the world00:40:37.960 to allow its citizens to monetize their00:40:39.520 own data good old Brazil we love Brazil00:40:42.599 lived in Brazil for a few years there00:40:44.000 you go why the F Brazil um because they00:40:47.200 built the technology why if Brazil a00:40:49.839 developing country as big as it is00:40:52.040 Amazon covering a big chunk of it why it00:40:55.800 is crazy so over the last five years I'd00:40:59.359 say they've gone on a massive00:41:01.079 digitization Journey um I'm not sure if00:41:03.760 your listeners will be aware of the Pix00:41:04.920 network but it's a it's a competitive00:41:07.079 Network to the traditional payment00:41:08.680 companies but it's digital so the the00:41:11.280 fees are a lot cheaper but it makes it00:41:13.160 more accessible to everyone so they're00:41:15.079 almost using those digital rails now to00:41:17.240 eventually push tokens across them so00:41:19.400 now I've got a digital rail that means I00:41:20.760 can put any type of payment across it00:41:22.640 whether it be data whether it be Bitcoin00:41:24.160 it doesn't really matter um so now00:41:26.520 they've moved on to this level well00:41:28.160 actually isn't it time that our citizens00:41:30.359 got rewarded for how their data is being00:41:32.200 used um so that was literally written00:41:34.319 almost written into law last year this00:41:35.640 year so there's going for consultation00:41:37.839 and then once that becomes law again00:41:39.720 that could be a reference point for the00:41:41.000 rest of the world to say well hang on00:41:43.680 looks like things are changing and this00:41:45.160 is why you'll see these companies like00:41:46.880 even when I started writing my book00:41:48.720 there was no one it's taking me that00:41:50.960 long there's like now 30 40 people I00:41:53.359 meet all over the world I met people00:41:54.839 last week who are doing blockchain for00:41:56.920 health care in the United Kingdom MH00:41:58.920 they're working with patients and00:42:00.400 they're working with hospitals so they00:42:02.040 share data with patients and they also00:42:03.839 make money from that data so this is00:42:06.280 happening right now um and that's why00:42:08.760 this is exciting for me00:42:10.640 because it won't be the monetization00:42:12.880 that's the exciting bit is the things00:42:14.160 that we've talked about which is the00:42:15.520 prevention the ability to create your00:42:17.640 own mini programs to manage your health00:42:19.720 to manage your Finance you know talk00:42:21.680 about utilities that would excite your00:42:23.240 audience today not many people can00:42:25.760 understand Financial products mhm um00:42:28.000 because unfortunately that's a problem00:42:29.480 for the banking system because they just00:42:31.280 push their products to customers and00:42:32.640 hope they understand U not all banks do00:42:35.040 that but when you on your own data and00:42:37.359 you have an AI all of a sudden now that00:42:39.400 will then tailor what it tells you based00:42:41.079 on your level of understanding and00:42:42.720 learning so imagine hold on a minute00:42:44.720 let's just let's do that another way so00:42:46.760 everyone can get that because that's big00:42:48.520 yeah say that again so imagine today I00:42:51.960 have a mortgage and I'm given a leaflet00:42:54.599 that explains the mortgage to me uhuh00:42:56.680 everybody's understand that differently00:42:58.119 based on their literacy level yeah some00:43:00.000 people just won't get it yeah but what00:43:02.040 if your AI knew your educational history00:43:05.760 all your experience all your data and00:43:08.319 then suddenly interpreted that mortgage00:43:10.119 into a way that you00:43:14.839 understood that's the point in all this00:43:16.800 we have collected a lifetime worth of00:43:19.000 data and it tells everything about our00:43:21.440 past it tells us everything who we are00:43:24.200 but it also tells us who we could become00:43:26.880 and that's really the power when you00:43:28.040 start connecting all of this stuff00:43:30.119 because there is so much we've lost00:43:33.200 because it's been deleted but there's so00:43:35.079 much that we could gain because we can't00:43:36.839 get at it if we could get at it and00:43:39.440 connect it we could do so much more and00:43:42.280 what is making this conversation00:43:44.079 possible today is because the irony is00:43:46.599 all these technologies have come00:43:47.920 together at the same time and our00:43:49.880 maturity as a population of acceptance00:43:52.200 of technology is a lot higher than it00:43:53.760 was talk to me about the bit being00:43:56.599 deleted data being lost that will um I00:43:59.920 me I there was a guy in the office that00:44:01.440 came to me the other day and he said00:44:02.480 I've just got myself a new phone he said00:44:03.880 I've just lost 20 years of WhatsApp00:44:05.480 messages I'm like I'm not sure you had00:44:06.839 WhatsApp for 20 years but nonetheless00:44:08.520 said he said I said and he's got one00:44:10.480 Samsung phone to another I said well00:44:11.839 you've got your Samsung account you can00:44:13.200 find it no it's gone it's gone it's gone00:44:15.960 and I was like well you know what that00:44:17.160 might be a fresh00:44:18.760 start cuz if you got 20 years of00:44:20.880 messages on your phone then what kind of00:44:22.880 a life are you living but that aside he00:44:26.160 he then said to me but you don't realize00:44:28.000 he said there's all kinds of clients and00:44:30.720 leads and opportunities and Business00:44:32.760 Development chances that now I've lost00:44:34.880 and I won't be able to remember so00:44:37.400 that's that's that's that's a normal guy00:44:39.240 losing his data on his WhatsApp give me00:44:41.480 give me your explanation00:44:43.800 so he's correct obviously his timeline's00:44:46.440 not quite accurate um but he is correct00:44:49.960 so but the important thing that people00:44:51.520 need to realize is data is now a00:44:52.839 cultural artifact as well it's a record00:44:55.680 of who we were um 14 million people year00:44:58.400 ago to the pyramids of Egypt yeah right00:45:00.520 there's a reason for that because00:45:01.720 they're trying to understand the stories00:45:02.920 of the past that's where they go um data00:45:06.720 now has become a cultural artifact but00:45:08.480 we don't treat it as such so from 199100:45:11.359 to 1995 the internet was never archived00:45:14.359 there's very little record of the00:45:15.880 internet from 1991 to 1995 okay 2009 and00:45:20.079 I we're showing our age right 2009 to00:45:22.160 2018 was the year of the geoc Cities the00:45:24.800 Myspace these big dominant um websites00:45:27.920 right where people used to write their00:45:29.079 music put their you know a lot of00:45:30.920 artists were discovered on my St B right00:45:33.599 um and you also got songs music stories00:45:36.200 everything blogs um all00:45:38.440 deleted on mypace Geo CI doesn't exist00:45:41.359 anymore it's been deleted Gio Ci's gone00:45:43.880 Myspace gone every piece of information00:45:47.599 that was on there downloaded uploaded00:45:49.280 Sorry by everybody je cities was wiped00:45:51.559 35 million users were gone so if you add00:45:55.359 up all of the websites that were deleted00:45:57.520 between 2009 and 2018 just to bring this00:46:00.559 to life for your audience that's the00:46:02.480 equivalent of me standing in front of00:46:03.839 the New York library and hitting delete00:46:05.119 and wiping it off the face of the earth00:46:07.480 that is half the Vatican archives being00:46:09.640 deleted that's what that means during00:46:12.480 covid the my understanding is that the00:46:15.480 British Museum and archives struggled to00:46:17.400 piece Co00:46:18.640 together because our data is constantly00:46:21.000 being deleted because it's not in our00:46:23.079 control um and also let's go back to00:46:26.240 WhatsApp as well00:46:27.839 let to make your audience think a little00:46:29.119 bit so I'm going to show My Age Again um00:46:31.720 again this demonstrates our lack of00:46:32.920 can't sit in my studio I know I'm you00:46:35.040 like you do shave like you're in a00:46:37.640 bloody boy bad talk to people about your00:46:39.720 age I know you're about 25 just want to00:46:42.359 shave um right so let's talk about this00:46:45.720 so if I talk about um if where we going00:46:49.040 with this so there's the cultural00:46:50.760 component yeah and then there's also was00:46:53.359 what was I saying WhatsApp WhatsApp yeah00:46:54.839 let's go back to WhatsApp so when we00:46:56.359 think of WhatsApp today let's go back to00:46:58.319 maybe I think it was the early 2000s00:47:00.280 Rupert Murdo tried to buy00:47:02.079 Sky he was told no he went through the00:47:05.119 competition Authority they said you00:47:06.400 can't do this because you will have the00:47:07.520 Monopoly on news Fair many years later00:47:11.880 Facebook buys WhatsApp and Instagram my00:47:14.400 argument is it's the same thing they now00:47:16.720 control the news and they control00:47:18.240 communication this is a a00:47:20.359 misunderstanding of not only the00:47:21.880 cultural example I give in terms of well00:47:24.040 we don't really understand the think of00:47:25.160 data as culture MH we also don't think00:47:27.440 of data and the companies that manage it00:47:29.319 as a form of communication and news so00:47:31.599 it's also a regulatory Gap when so the00:47:34.640 lot of the laws that exist today around00:47:36.559 merges and Acquisitions and competition00:47:38.680 they don't actually look at why these00:47:40.559 companies are buying these technology00:47:42.880 companies today they're not buying them00:47:44.680 for other than yes the technology but00:47:47.240 also the data that they can generate and00:47:48.920 they have so we are missing a lot of00:47:52.400 things that are on the surface not00:47:54.240 obvious so there's the data C culture00:47:56.680 there's there's the data merger and00:47:57.839 acquisition there's the data utilization00:48:00.440 we don't see all of these things have00:48:02.280 been going on for decades it's just the00:48:04.480 fact that AI has exposed them to us is00:48:06.920 there many people like you out there00:48:08.559 that are really excited about this00:48:10.400 subject matter that you spend time with00:48:12.559 talking to or is it or is it still very00:48:17.280 very early no it's so it's interesting00:48:20.119 it's almost like you bump into people00:48:22.280 like the universe wants you to meet them00:48:24.319 so I I I tend to bump into people at00:48:26.359 event saw through the network so I met00:48:30.040 the guy from the data wallet through a00:48:31.440 well-known person and you know he was00:48:33.599 like me to my brother right he was00:48:34.839 literally not only talking about a piece00:48:36.960 of what I'm talking about like he was00:48:38.200 building it and he could show me bits of00:48:40.160 it um and he was involved in the00:48:41.960 Brazilian regulation um and then i' met00:48:44.559 someone recently who's building all the00:48:45.960 health stuff so the cool thing is I'm00:48:48.760 meeting lots of people who are building00:48:51.520 in the book The Puzzle that I'm00:48:53.880 describing and we're describing is being00:48:55.640 built um that's exciting bit so now now00:48:59.240 my argument is always the same now we've00:49:00.720 got the tools we just need the will we00:49:02.680 need to change the way and that's part00:49:04.280 of you know what I'm doing and others00:49:06.040 like me are doing and part of the the00:49:07.760 work we're doing to help businesses and00:49:10.000 governments rethink this really00:49:12.520 important asset that's going to become00:49:14.680 crucial because there's also the people00:49:16.880 component in this that I think we' lost00:49:18.440 as well um which I think they will00:49:21.000 become even more important with AI Than00:49:22.599 People realize I think particularly with00:49:23.960 data interesting now your book is out00:49:27.119 when so this te is taking longer than I00:49:29.440 thought and that's cuz the world doesn't00:49:31.359 stop so 2025 so early 2025 is the plan00:49:35.079 and the name of the book uh data00:49:36.520 Revolution the rise of an asset data00:49:38.920 Revolution the rise of an asset will you00:49:40.480 do it for us in audio form as well for00:49:42.480 people that 100% um So the plan is to do00:49:45.000 two things actually so the first part of00:49:46.440 the book is a voice for a generation to00:49:48.799 demand change is to show them what data00:49:51.599 is and what it became and how it changed00:49:53.440 and what we Mis outed on but also what00:49:55.240 could be um this is not sad story um and00:49:58.359 then we show them the model to make this00:50:00.119 work so you've asked all the right00:50:02.079 questions today um and that's why I00:50:04.200 didn't want to leave people hanging and00:50:05.799 go well okay this is a great book about00:50:07.240 history what does this mean because I00:50:08.440 think the talking is over we need00:50:09.760 direction now so the second part of the00:50:11.760 book is the guide book on how to do it00:50:13.680 so the regulation the model that makes00:50:15.440 it work all the things that you've asked00:50:17.000 me about today will be in there even new00:50:19.079 curriculums for school even the way the00:50:21.079 businesses need to think about hiring00:50:22.440 people and all the skills that they're00:50:23.680 going to be needing to make all of this00:50:25.359 work if you if you if you've got kids at00:50:27.799 school and they're seven or eight years00:50:30.160 old this this is essentially essentially00:50:33.720 this is essential as a subject matter00:50:35.760 for them to learn oh 100% because I I00:50:38.160 think it's a combination of data and AI00:50:40.559 so we're seeing a lot of conversation00:50:43.160 around curriculums for AI and teaching00:50:45.359 kids I'm seeing nothing about data and I00:50:47.880 think the two go hand inand um I will00:50:50.799 guarantee something in in three four00:50:52.319 years time the skills and experiences00:50:54.720 that people bring to a business or00:50:56.160 people have in their own life will00:50:58.040 become incredibly valuable to businesses00:50:59.760 to the point where and I'll show in the00:51:01.160 book how you can start valuing people's00:51:03.119 skills because it's those skills are00:51:05.319 going to be important to read what AI00:51:07.599 says but also give the data that AI00:51:10.040 needs because they're going to come from00:51:11.680 people right absolutely okay three tips00:51:14.960 you can give the man on the street00:51:17.319 related to his data that he can sit and00:51:20.720 and be highly aware of now and get him00:51:23.280 into a really conscious state so I think00:51:25.440 the first thing is have a think about00:51:28.160 how much data you use every day and what00:51:30.200 do you use it for and second is who are00:51:32.599 you giving that data away to and are00:51:35.240 there ways that you can maybe stop that00:51:37.280 because there are tools on apps that00:51:38.400 allow you to do it um and there's also00:51:40.480 other technologies that you can find on00:51:41.920 the web that may help you get the most00:51:43.119 from it I think the third thing is the00:51:45.400 most important is start thinking about00:51:47.720 how you can use that data in your own00:51:49.160 life to make it better um like I work00:51:52.119 with my PT constantly and we're using00:51:53.880 data to improve my performance or even00:51:56.599 just simple things like I use data to00:51:57.960 cure my own health um so start looking00:52:01.480 at these things as tools so you know be00:52:04.200 careful who you give it to understand00:52:05.520 what you're giving but more importantly00:52:07.119 start to build an understanding how you00:52:08.559 can use it for yourself in ways other00:52:10.640 than just making money and I guess00:52:12.240 there's a fourth one which is look00:52:13.960 beyond the technology and don't be00:52:15.359 afraid about AI because actually once00:52:17.640 you start understanding your data and00:52:19.119 you can actually understand how to read00:52:20.359 it AI starts to become really useful00:52:22.359 then because it's not really about then00:52:24.040 as taking their jobs it's about working00:52:25.880 with AI00:52:27.160 to understand these predictive things00:52:28.880 that we've been talking about incredibly00:52:31.040 value Michael God thank you enough for00:52:33.160 coming and sharing this wisdom with us00:52:34.680 today it's been fantastic talking to you00:52:36.319 thank you so much for joining us no00:52:37.640 thanks for having me it's been amazing"
