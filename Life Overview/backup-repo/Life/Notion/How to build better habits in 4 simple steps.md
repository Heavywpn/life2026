### Why your brain builds habits

  

==**Habit: A behaviour that has been repeated enough times to become automatic**==

  

==**The feedback loop behind all human behaviour is try, fail, learn, try differently**==

  

==**Habits are reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment**==

  

==**When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look for. There is no longer a need to analyse every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that**==

  

==**Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience**==

  

==**A habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past**==

  

==**Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.**==

  

==**Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks**==

  

==**When you have your habits dialled in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the next set of problems**==

  

> ==**Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future**==

  

  

### The science of how habits work

==**The 4-step process of building a habits:**==

1. ==**Cue**==
2. ==**Craving**==
3. ==**Response**==
4. ==**Reward**==

==**Cue:**== ==**The cure triggers your brain to initiate a behaviour**==

==**It is a bit of information that predicts a reward**==

  

==**Cravings:**== ==**They are the motivational force behind every habit**==

==**What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers**==

  

==**Response:**== ==**The actual habit you perform**==

==**A habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it**==

  

==**Reward:**== ==**Delivered by a response and is the end goal of every habit**==

==**The cue is about noticing the reward.**  
**The craving is about wanting the reward.**  
**The response is about obtaining the reward.**  
**The reward either satisfy us or teach us.**==

  

==**If a behaviour is insufficient in any of the 4 stages, it will not become a habit**==

  

==**Without the first 3 steps, a behaviour will not occur. And without all 4 a behaviour will not be repeated.**==

  

  

### The habit loop

==**The cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving, and ultimately becomes associated with the cue.**==

  

==**The Problem Phase:**== ==**The cue and craving**== ==**(when you realize something needs to change)**==

==**The Solution Phase:**== ==**The response and reward**== ==**(when you take action and achieve the change you desire)**==

  

  

==**All behaviour is driven by the desire to solve a problem**==

  

### The 4 laws of behaviour change

  

==**You can think of each law as a lever that influences human behaviour. When the levers are in the right positions, creating good habits is effortless. When they are in the wrong positions, it is nearly impossible.**==

  

|Laws|Create Good Habit|Create Bad Habit|
|---|---|---|
|1st Law: Cue|Make it obvious|Make it invisible|
|2nd Law: Craving|Make it attractive|Make it unattractive|
|3rd Law: Response|Make it easy|Make it difficult|
|4th Law: Reward|Make it satisfying|Make it unsatisfying|

  

==**Whenever you want to change your behaviour as yourself:**==

1. ==**How can I make it obvious?**==
2. ==**How can I make it attractive?**==
3. ==**How can I make it easy?**==
4. ==**How can I make it satisfying?**==

  

  

==**The key to creating good habits and breaking bad ones is to understand these fundamental laws and how to alter them to your specifications**==

  

==**Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature.**==
