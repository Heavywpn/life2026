## Key Wisdom from Tim Ferriss' Caffeine Experiment

- **Self-awareness is crucial:** Regularly reassessing our habits and dependencies can lead to surprising insights about our true baseline state.
- **Challenge assumptions:** What we perceive as "normal" or "necessary" might actually be a conditioned state, not our natural baseline.
- **Quality sleep is fundamental:** Eliminating caffeine can significantly improve sleep quality, which has far-reaching effects on overall well-being and productivity.
- **Recognize emotional dependencies:** We often use substances like caffeine as emotional crutches or "security blankets" during stressful times.
- **Tolerance develops quickly:** Even short-term use of caffeine can lead to dependency and withdrawal symptoms, highlighting its potency as a drug.
- **Periodic resets are valuable:** Taking breaks from habitual substances can provide clarity and help recalibrate our natural state.
- **Question your "tired":** What we interpret as fatigue might actually be a calm, non-stimulated state that we're no longer accustomed to.
- **Be mindful of sleep architecture:** Substances like caffeine can affect sleep quality even if they don't prevent falling asleep.

These insights encourage us to be more mindful of our caffeine consumption and to periodically reassess its role in our lives, potentially leading to improved well-being and a better understanding of our natural state.

- I took a month off of caffeine anything  
    caffeinated which was the first turkey  
    cold turkey which was the first time  
    I've done that probably I would have to  
    imagine since I was what 16 I mean it's  
    been forever let me ask you a question  
    here why would you do that cold turkey  
    why not just do like oh a half a cup of  
    coffee today and then maybe a quarter  
    cup a few days later like why go this is  
    like the extreme Tim did you get  
    headaches yeah I got headaches but but  
    it was during a period where I could  
    no I didn't use vikin I I knew that I  
    could accept the headaches and I had a  
    period of time where there really was a  
    low cost where like professionally I was  
    taking 3 to four weeks off the grid and  
    I knew that I had a grace period where I  
    could sustain it so I did  
    effectively no caffeine no  
    alcohol and I suppose the most important  
    other item no sex no sex no ejaculation  
    which is we can talk about that that's  
    pretty easy uh the the harder one is I  
    did nothing  
    sweet so not just containing sugar but  
    nothing sweet so anything that has an  
    artificial sweetener was out would you  
    consider this tequila sweet I would not  
    consider this tequila sweet and there is  
    a there is a bit of subjectivity for a  
    lot of it it's got sweet notes to it  
    like it's not yeah it's it's got some  
    floral notes to it but by the kind of  
    letter of the law I wouldn't consider  
    this subjectively to be sweet but for  
    instance any kind of juice out any type  
    of sweetness of course out let's just  
    say different types of plantains if they  
    are sweet to The Taste they're out sweet  
    potatoes out and is that hard for you  
    that that that's not hard for me it  
    doesn't seem hard but let's just extend  
    this almost every toothpaste has  
    sorbital or some kind of crap in it that  
    is a sweetener so no brushing your teeth  
    for two weeks I brush my teeth with  
    sodium bicarb just baking soda straight  
    up I I brushed my teeth with that for  
    for a handful of of weeks and what you  
    also realize is in the US or in this  
    case when I went to Korea if you ask  
    people if if a b or c has any added  
    sugar there is sugar or some type of  
    sweetener in almost everything yeah that  
    you come across that was interesting it  
    was challenging cuz it's severely  
    limited what I could  
    eat but the caffeine  
    was an amazing experience now I alluded  
    to this a little bit earlier I'm back on  
    the sauce over the last week week and a  
    half which I regret number one and I'm  
    paying a lot for like there are costs I  
    can expl sleep I so let me let me back  
    up and I'll just give you the the punch  
    tell us why you did this to begin with  
    cuz you didn't mention that like it  
    wasn't a New Year's resolution why yeah  
    I so the reason I did it started because  
    I was in South America doing a bunch of  
    weird stuff and there were restrictions  
    and I justed but weird stuff's  
    psychedelics yeah psychedelics which  
    which will tie into part of My Strange  
    story  
    later but I hadn't done the type of  
    training I was doing in South America in  
    probably five or six years and so I took  
    restrictions very seriously I think that  
    is important in my opinion and then I  
    extended them all and I wanted to see in  
    part because I met someone who said they  
    had stopped drinking anything  
    caffeinated cold turkey because they  
    felt like a loser because they they'd  
    become dependent on it and they missed a  
    really important ski day like one of the  
    first days of the season and they're a  
    really good skier and they were with a  
    group of people and they were the only I  
    believe they were the only person who  
    skipped and that day there were just  
    like no more and to this day you know  
    like two years later caffeine free and  
    wa wait I lost something there MH when I  
    wake up in the morning and I have a cup  
    of coffee I can go skiing why did they  
    missed ski cuz they couldn't have coffee  
    they were because they didn't have  
    coffee that morning and they were so  
    tired oh that they felt like they  
    couldn't do it so they stayed on the ski  
    lift instead of getting off they just  
    went around went straight back down  
    that's amazing and called it a day and  
    and to their credit be under the weather  
    or something they but to their credit  
    they were just like this is [ __ ]  
    loser Behavior enough and they went to  
    zero that caught my attention because  
    when you talk to someone no no offense  
    to anyone who fits in this category but  
    let's just say say if someone is a  
    Mormon and they've never had caffeine MH  
    that's not my life right they've never  
    had a hit of the sauce I mean although  
    technically their workarounds like Diet  
    Coke instead of coffee but well we're  
    not going to get into the weeds theer  
    but like if somebody hasn't had a taste  
    of the like delicious poison there's so  
    many things right there's so many things  
    like this where it's like okay if you've  
    had one significant other and you've  
    never been out and about and like  
    sampled the buffet of the world like we  
    can't really have it's very hard to have  
    an Apples to Apples talk about  
    relationships like it's just it's a  
    different situation right same with  
    caffeine but this person had been  
    hitting the sauce for decades and then  
    they got off and that was inspiring to  
    me then I had this restriction and I  
    just extended it and just to give the  
    punchline my sleeping issues that I've  
    had for decades every single one just  
    vanished best sleep of the last 20  
    years woke up Wide Awake every morning  
    after the first like let's just call  
    like a week and a half had tons of  
    energy and got a super high volume of of  
    stuff done and what I realized and the  
    part of the reason to answer your meta  
    question why did I do all of these  
    things I was curious what my real  
    Baseline was like what does real  
    Baseline look like what is Tim untouched  
    unaffected by all all these various  
    supplements that's another thing I took  
    a month off of all supplements I only I  
    only took my prescription meds like the  
    uloric and so on yeah I got rid of all  
    supplements and no Deca or testosterone  
    or anything no Deca no nothing okay and  
    I was very curious to reacquaint myself  
    with what like the sort of pure Baseline  
    Tim is and turns out Baseline Tim does  
    really well  
    and why go back then why why well you  
    got hung over no I didn't get hung over  
    I didn't get hung over this good after  
    after hangover a little bit of L juice  
    so I also before I went to South America  
    I listened to an audio book which was  
    called or is called the easy way to quit  
    caffeine and that that is an extension  
    of a brand that started with smoking I  
    think it's the easy way to quit smoking  
    and I know people who have literally  
    multiple people who've listened to this  
    they have their last cigarette and  
    they're done and they stop so it's a  
    little hokey  
    but that made an impact on me as well  
    I'll do that for January I'm write that  
    down on my list January no caffine and  
    now that I know I can do it I'm  
    definitely going to do it again the  
    reason that I got back on it and this is  
    this is I'll actually add just a little  
    bit of color the first is that there  
    were days without caffeine where I would  
    say to myself I'm tired I really want a  
    cappuccino but I realized because I  
    interrogated I was like well I'm not  
    allowed to have a cappuccino am I really  
    tired and I came to the conclusion that  
    no I was wasn't actually tired I just  
    wasn't [ __ ] wired you see what I mean  
    like my my normal had become multiple  
    coffees in the morning and God knows  
    what else so I had taken as my  
    Baseline a default I mean wired sounds  
    too negative but like stimulated State  
    and when that was removed the story that  
    I conjured was I'm  
    tired but when I was unable to have the  
    cappuccino know and I went on to record  
    a podcast podcast turns out great I'm  
    like okay let me revisit this I wasn't  
    tired I was just calm interesting crazy  
    interesting and why did I get back on  
    coffee coffee for me I've realized is  
    probably like alcohol for a lot of folks  
    and there's sometimes I'm not going to  
    lie look let's be honest here like there  
    are times I was like I want to take the  
    edge off sure have a drink right but  
    more often I don't drink that much I use  
    coffee as like a security blanket when  
    my life gets hit with something  
    unpredictable or  
    unpredicted and things seem a little out  
    of control or I'm not sure how I'm going  
    to make it through something like  
    walking to the coffee shop in the  
    morning and having that coffee it's it's  
    a life raft of consistency yeah we saw  
    this during Co right where people would  
    line up at Starbucks for 3 hours to get  
    a coffee because it was like the one  
    semblance of you know and there's also a  
    high to it so it's like also a high so  
    even though I realize intellectually  
    that it's counterproductive like when I  
    am feeling as I have been for a host of  
    reasons that I won't bore people with  
    but just gone through a a pretty  
    challenging week or two my response to  
    feeling a little anxious is to want  
    coffee even though it increases anxiety  
    now are you a physiologically i i this  
    is one thing actually we've known each  
    other for a long time I I don't know the  
    answer this I don't know that I've seen  
    you do this are you an afternoon coffee  
    guy at all I don't know that I've seen  
    you do um mate maybe a little bit later  
    but like I I typically do not have  
    coffee in the afternoons and I really  
    try not to have caffine in the  
    afternoons which I violated this week so  
    in the last like two two days or I  
    should say in the last let's just say in  
    the past seven days I have violated that  
    and what I've realized because I've run  
    the end of one now and there are a bunch  
    of different variables so I realize this  
    is imprecise it's not a perfect science  
    is that I can drink coffee and fall  
    asleep that's not the problem but it  
    disrupts my sleep architecture quity of  
    sleep I wake up after 3 days very little  
    time 3 days of drinking caffeine I wake  
    up and I have circles under my eyes like  
    dark circles are you are you quantifying  
    this in in the sense of like are you  
    wearing an aura ring do you have any  
    other data where you're looking at it  
    I'm not currently capturing the data  
    with an aura ring but I have in the past  
    yeah I've seen what it looks like so I  
    know that's the case I'm falling asleep  
    my time in bed if we're just looking at  
    a clock is fine but I'm waking up tired  
    I hate that and then what do you want  
    you want another hit of course you want  
    more of the sauce thing the juice and  
    there's a lot to be said for it um this  
    is not to completely knock coffee like I  
    don't think for the rest of my life I'm  
    going to be  
    caffeine-free but now I have a better  
    awareness of what my Baseline looks like  
    so I can return to that so let me tell  
    you something crazy uh this was before I  
    met Daria so I'm I'm trying to go back  
    in in in years now so probably let's  
    just call it 15 years ago I gave up  
    coffee for about 6 months 6 months yeah  
    that's legit well but I wasn't really  
    that addicted to it I was having like a  
    cup every other day or whatever and I I  
    went back I remember I was living in San  
    Francisco at the time and I went to rual  
    Coffee which is fantastic coffee place  
    great place and I I ordered a tall like  
    single origin coffee and I drank the  
    whole thing when you go 6 months without  
    coffee and you have a full cup of coffee  
    you feel high as a kite I was like 10x  
    what I feel today with a cup of coffee  
    yeah cuz your body just like I mean it  
    is a powerful drug when you you've gone  
    without it for a while super powerful do  
    you have any sense of how long it takes  
    to like get that back like how long do  
    do have you done any research to get  
    what back that initial like like  
    Childhood High of like that first cup of  
    coffee how long do you go without before  
    you get back tell you like I don't know  
    I don't know I will say on the opposite  
    end which is what I thought you were  
    asking how long does it take to develop  
    tolerance and experience with withdrawal  
    symptoms it is so fast oh so fast and  
    one day if you go without coffee Serious  
    Coffee drinkers will be headaches yeah  
    well I would say furthermore if you stop  
    drinking coffee and I'm using coffee as  
    a bit of a scape cope here like I love  
    coffee but if you if you go without  
    caffeine and then you get back on  
    caffeine and you're on it for 2 or 3  
    days and then you stop again my personal  
    experience is you are going to feel  
    withdrawal symptoms and that is unlike  
    most other drugs it is a powerful  
    powerful powerful drug right like I'm  
    not recommending this but hypothetically  
    if you were to like smoke cigarettes for  
    a few days and then stop you're fine  
    yeah no problem you're not going to have  
    a headache the next day but with  
    caffeine it is an incredibly powerful  
    drug and I think that's in part because  
    it is often disrupting sleep  
    architecture
- Key Insights from Tim Ferriss' Caffeine Experiment
- **Cold Turkey Approach:** Tim quit caffeine completely for a month, along with alcohol and other stimulants, to reset his baseline.
- **Sleep Improvement:** After about a week and a half, Tim experienced the best sleep he'd had in 20 years, waking up wide awake every morning.
- **Energy Levels:** Contrary to expectations, Tim had high energy levels and productivity without caffeine.
- **Baseline Realization:** Tim discovered that his natural baseline state was actually quite good, challenging his perception of needing caffeine.
- **Caffeine as a Crutch:** Tim realized he often used coffee as a "security blanket" during stressful or unpredictable times.
- **Sleep Architecture:** While caffeine might not prevent falling asleep, it can disrupt sleep quality, leading to tiredness upon waking.
- **Rapid Tolerance:** Caffeine tolerance and withdrawal symptoms can develop surprisingly quickly, even after just a few days of consumption.
- **Powerful Drug:** Tim emphasizes that caffeine is a potent drug, with withdrawal symptoms occurring faster than many other substances.
- These insights highlight the complex relationship many people have with caffeine and the potential benefits of periodically reassessing its role in one's life.
