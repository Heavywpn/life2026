Transcipt: 0:00all right so by stomach and thyme0:03braised lamb shoulder this is a dish we0:06used to cook heaps of in a restaurant i0:07worked at in london called tom's kitchen0:09was uh owned by a chef or uncle tom0:11atkins0:12and his twin brother was working there0:14as well at time when i was working there0:15both fantastic chefs0:18i think rob now lives in the states and0:20tom's stool and chelsea so this dish is0:23a version of that dish kind of adapted0:26it a bit slightly for home for you guys0:27to cook at home0:29and i'm going to cook it in the slow0:30cooker just a domestic slow cooker i0:31think that works really well as a set0:33and forget type of dish um bit of work0:35in the morning and then when you kind of0:36in the afternoon it's all good to go0:39uh if you don't have a slow cooker you0:40can just do this in a cupboard pot or a0:43dutch oven in the oven that works just0:44as well0:45or even a pressure cooker so as far as0:48ingredients obviously we need a lamb0:49shoulder this is what's called an oyster0:50cut lamb shoulder from the guys in0:53victoria at hardworks these guys produce0:54some excellent land0:56and and the oyster cut is kind of that0:58top shoulder blade part but if you uh1:01want to do a whole lamb shoulder you can1:02definitely do that and adapt the recipe1:04just by doubling the other ingredients1:06or not even doubling um maybe another1:08half of the other ingredients um but you1:10just want lamb shoulder you want that1:11into muscular tissue and fat which you1:14know works really well on these slow1:16braises so then we just got some basic1:18chicken stock um if you're buying the1:20box type of chicken stock from1:21supermarket make sure you're getting a1:22low sodium one otherwise when you reduce1:25your sauce at the end it does become1:27often become a bit too salty1:29and basic naropa carrots and onions uh1:31some garlic thyme that's new vinegar1:33obviously and then we're gonna do some1:35of the shallots differently we'll cook1:36them separately so that we can really1:38control how well they're cooked and they1:39don't go kind of mushy um these shallots1:41when they're cooked like this1:43are delicious they're super tasty if you1:45can't find these shallots which i've1:47referred to as banana shallots i'm not1:48sure1:49maybe they're good french lots as well1:52if you can't find these just use baby1:53onions1:54let's get started1:56so first thing we need to do is get the1:58lamb shoulder ready and sealed off1:59before we put it in our slow cooker so2:02take your lamb out of your packet dry it2:03off and then give it a good season with2:05salt but no pepper at this point i find2:07that the pepper burns a bit too much2:09when you're trying to seal it off2:10in a heavy base fry pan with a decent2:13amount of oil in it put your lamb2:15shoulder in with the fat side down now2:17you're going to seal this off for about2:1810 to 15 minutes so you get good golden2:20color and while that's happening you can2:22get your mirror path sorted so cut your2:23onion in quarters and peel it slice your2:26carrot on an angle just take the tops2:28off no need to peel it either2:30cut a head of garlic in half and get2:32your thyme ready now you can see we're2:34starting to develop some good color on2:35this lamb but we really want to2:37emphasize how important it is to get as2:39much calories you can on this before you2:41start doing your veggies it's also2:43important to seal the slam on all sides2:46just to lock all that flavor in before2:48you start slow cooking it so once that's2:50sealed take it out and set it to the2:52side and then you can start getting some2:54color on your mirror file now don't be2:56as reckless as i am and be careful when2:57you've got hot oil in a pan just2:59chucking your carrots in but get some3:01good color on all sides on all your3:03carrots and onions3:05before you add your calf garlic clove3:07with the flesh side down3:09and your time as well just to start3:11getting those oils out of it you can3:13notice there i've also tied the time3:15together that just stops it from falling3:16apart making it easier to pull out3:19in goes your balsamic vinegar just to3:20deglaze the pan and then that goes in3:22the bottom of your slow cooker with your3:24lamb on top so now it's time to add the3:26chicken stock and on the recipe i've3:28called for a liter of chicken stock but3:30just use your initiative as to how much3:31you use because you don't want to3:33completely cover the lamb you still want3:35that delicious gold in the outside part3:37protruding the stock level3:40once you've got your stock in there and3:42goes the lid and into your slow cooker3:44on low for seven hours3:46and if you're doing this in an oven then3:48set your oven temperature to 80 degrees3:50celsius3:51all right so it's about seven hours3:52later and it's time to get our shallots3:54ready now you see i've peeled these but3:55i've left the core intact and that's3:57super important so it doesn't fall apart3:59when you cook it later so once you've4:01peeled them just slice them in half and4:03with that core intact it will stay4:05together once you cook them4:07onto a tray and then just give them a4:08good seasoning with salt and then over4:11to a pan on medium heat that you can4:13ideally put this pan in the oven4:14otherwise you have to take them out and4:16put them on a tray you can put them in4:17the oven so with a light drizzle of4:19olive oil put the shallots skin side4:21down and after about two or three4:23minutes you can add your dollop of4:25butter4:26once your butter is all nice and browned4:28you can add your sprigs of thyme and4:29then check to make sure that you've got4:31nice color on the slots for adding your4:33balsamic vinegar4:35into 180 degree oven for 15 to 204:39minutes or until they're just cooked you4:41know nice you can put a knife through4:43them4:44but they're still holding together4:46all right time to deal to this lamb4:48shoulder so pull your slow cooker out4:50and get a tray ready for your lamb4:53shoulder and you're going to remove the4:55slam shoulder from the source uh nice4:57and carefully just making sure it4:59doesn't fall apart on you now it5:00shouldn't fall apart after seven hours5:02it should stay together um but it will5:04be tender so you know take your time and5:06be delicate with it so in a clean5:08saucepan through a fine mesh sieve5:10you're just going to pass your braising5:12liquid off and this is what's going to5:14make the sauce so it's super flavorful5:17but you just want to pass it and then5:19give it a skimmed make sure there's none5:21of that lamb fat kind of on the top you5:22don't want that lamp fat emulsifying5:24into your sauce and friendly reminder to5:26keep your bench clean while you're5:27cooking5:29um so once that's come to the boil5:31give it a taste make sure the5:33seasoning's not too crazy just yet and5:35keep reducing this down until you've got5:37the flavor or the seasoning kind of5:39right where you want it and i'll be5:41tasting it every five to six minutes5:42just to make sure5:44i did this for about 25 minutes until i5:46was happy with it5:48all right so your shallots should be5:49ready now just pull those out and put5:51them on the same tray as the lamb we're5:52going to flash that to to reheat it when5:54we're ready with the sauce5:57this also stays in good but5:59i am going to cheat a bit and we're6:01going to thicken it with a bit of6:02cornstarch because after all this is6:04effectively a home cooking channel6:06rather than a professional cooking6:07channel in the real world in the6:08restaurant world we were never allowed6:10to thicken our sauces with corn flour or6:12roos or anything like that6:14these like very traditional kind of6:16style sauces um but you know hey we're6:18at home we can do what we want the only6:20other thing i'd say is it's a bit um too6:22forward on the carrot so i think i just6:24overdid it with the carrot i think i put6:26two in there uh in the recipe i'll put6:28one on i think it's gonna be just a6:29little bit less carrot but other than6:31that it's a it's a pretty tasty little6:32sauce6:36so to thicken our sauce with cornflour6:37we're going to make it what we call a6:38slurry so take your cornflour and then6:40just dissolve it in some cold water6:42before you pour into your sauce if you6:45pour the the cornflour directly into the6:47sauce it's just gonna go all lumpy6:49so it's also important to whisk your6:51slurry in while there's heat under the6:53sauce6:54um so now we're ready to plate so you're6:56gonna reheat your lamb shoulder and6:58shallots and i've just done some mash7:00here to have with it and i think this is7:02the perfect dish to serve family style7:04like we are here so take your lamb7:07shoulder from the oven and carefully7:09move it to your serving dish7:11and then now that you have your lamb7:13shoulder
