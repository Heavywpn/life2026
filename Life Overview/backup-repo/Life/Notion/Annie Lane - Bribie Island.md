# About

  

I have been in hospitality since the age of 16 and a qualified chef ever since.I have always been super passionate about the industry and a desire to tell a story and nourish through food and hospitality.What started as a food truck in 2016 quickly evolved into our first cafe **Gather & Feast.Annie Lane Cafe** was then opened in 2019 in our home town of Bribie Island.The name Annie Lane came from my Italian grandmother Annie.  Her love of good food, family values and importance of community lead to my journey in hospitality.  Unfortunately Annie is very unwell with dementia and is at her best when she walks down memory lane.  Hence where Annie Lane came from. ​Our mission is to celebrate the creativity of all things brunch, showcasing our local farmers and reducing food miles to create a sustainable approach to nourishing your bellies.  Life was never meant to be boring and our ever changing menu reflects this by keeping our customers constantly wowed and our staff excited.
