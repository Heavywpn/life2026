Today's readings cover significant events and teachings from both the Old Testament and the New Testament, as well as a Psalm. In Genesis, we see the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot's escape, and the moral complexities in Abraham's interactions with Abimelech. In Matthew, Jesus' teachings on the wise and foolish builders, His authority, and His healing miracles are highlighted. The Psalm is a plea for divine protection and justice from David.

## Reflection for Leadership Improvement

Reflecting on these passages, several key themes emerge that can enhance leadership:

1. **Judgment and Accountability:** The story of Sodom and Gomorrah underscores the importance of upholding moral standards and being accountable for one's actions. As a leader, it's crucial to maintain integrity and ensure that decisions are just and fair.
2. **Faith and Obedience:** Jesus' teachings emphasize the importance of building a strong foundation through faith and obedience. Leaders should foster a culture of trust and encourage their teams to adhere to core values and principles.
3. **Compassion and Healing:** Jesus' healing of the leper and others demonstrates the power of compassion. Effective leaders show empathy and support for their team members, addressing their needs and fostering a nurturing environment.
4. **Sacrifice and Commitment:** The cost of discipleship highlighted by Jesus reminds leaders of the sacrifices required to achieve greatness. Dedication and commitment to one's mission are essential for inspiring and guiding others.
5. **Appeal for Divine Guidance:** David's Psalm reflects a reliance on divine protection and justice. Leaders should seek wisdom and guidance, whether through faith or personal reflection, to navigate challenges and make righteous decisions.

By integrating these lessons into leadership practices, one can cultivate a more just, compassionate, and effective leadership style.

# Old testament

Genesis 19:1 - 20:18:

- **Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah:** Two angels visit Lot in Sodom. The city's wickedness is revealed, and God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah with fire and sulfur.
- **Lot's escape:** Lot and his daughters flee to Zoar. Lot's wife turns into a pillar of salt for looking back.
- **Lot and his daughters:** Fearing they are the last survivors, Lot's daughters get him drunk and conceive children with him.
- **Abraham and Abimelech:** Abraham moves to Gerar and tells King Abimelech that Sarah is his sister. God warns Abimelech in a dream, and he returns Sarah to Abraham.

This passage highlights themes of divine judgment, the consequences of sin, and God's protection of His chosen people. It also demonstrates the complex moral landscape of the ancient world and the imperfect nature of even those favored by God.

Note: Lot offered his daughters to many men to stop the men of Sodom raping the 2 strangrers / angels

# New Testament

Matthew 7:24 - 8:22:

- **The Wise and Foolish Builders (7:24-27):** Jesus compares those who hear and obey His words to a wise man who builds his house on rock, while those who don't obey are like a foolish man who builds on sand.
- **The Authority of Jesus (7:28-29):** The crowds are amazed at Jesus' teaching because He speaks with authority.
- **Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy (8:1-4):** Jesus touches and heals a man with leprosy, demonstrating His compassion and power.
- **The Faith of the Centurion (8:5-13):** Jesus heals a centurion's servant from afar, praising the centurion's exceptional faith.

- **The Cost of Following Jesus (8:18-22):** Jesus addresses the sacrifices required to follow Him, emphasizing the priority of discipleship.

These passages highlight Jesus' authority in teaching and healing, the importance of faith and obedience, and the demands of true discipleship.

  

# Proverbs

Psalm 7:1-9

> 1 Lord my God, I take refuge in you;  
> save and deliver me from all who pursue me,  
> 2 or they will tear me apart like a lion  
> and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.
> 
> 3 Lord my God, if I have done this  
> and there is guilt on my hands—  
> 4 if I have repaid my ally with evil  
> or without cause have robbed my foe—  
> 5 then let my enemy pursue and overtake me;  
> let him trample my life to the ground  
> and make me sleep in the dust.
> 
> 6 Arise, Lord, in your anger;  
> rise up against the rage of my enemies.  
> Awake, my God; decree justice.  
> 7 Let the assembled peoples gather around you,  
> while you sit enthroned over them on high.  
> 8 Let the Lord judge the peoples.  
> Vindicate me, Lord, according to my righteousness,  
> according to my integrity, O Most High.  
> 9 Bring to an end the violence of the wicked  
> and make the righteous secure—  
> you, the righteous God  
> who probes minds and hearts.

In this psalm, David appeals to God for protection and justice against his enemies. He proclaims his innocence and asks God to judge him according to his righteousness. The psalm emphasizes themes of divine justice, faith in God's protection, and the importance of integrity.
