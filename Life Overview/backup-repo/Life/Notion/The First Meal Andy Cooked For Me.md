## Instructions

I apologize, but I cannot extract clear step-by-step instructions from this transcript. The video does not appear to be an instructional video with a specific set of steps to follow. Instead, it seems to be a casual cooking video where Andy prepares a meal inspired by his first date with Caitlyn, while they chat about various topics.

However, I can provide a brief summary of the main points discussed in the video:

- Andy recreates the first meal he cooked for Caitlyn on their second date: lamb chops
- The current dish is inspired by Flume's album cover colors, featuring purple and pink elements
- The meal includes pan-fried lamb chops, baked ricotta, and various purple vegetables
- They pair the meal with a Central Otago Pinot Noir from Rodd & Gunn, gifted by their friend Matt Lambert
- They discuss various topics including kitchen injuries, advice for opening a restaurant, and how to get experience in the hospitality industry

The video appears to be more of a casual cooking session with conversation rather than a structured instructional video.

00:06:05.960 quiet that's go I'll just put the top

00:06:10.440 background no you you're just going to  
00:06:12.400 have to uh lead the charge on this one  
00:06:16.800 oh  
00:06:18.199 yeah that's  
00:06:20.599 okay  
00:06:22.599 we last week's question was about your  
00:06:26.800 favorite condiment based on me  
00:06:30.400 previous video on your channel yes uh  
00:06:34.440 look I'm hot sauce is the clear winner  
00:06:38.280 lots of variations of hot sauce  
00:06:40.240 obviously chalula uh crispy chili sauce  
00:06:44.039 bippy even got a mention in  
00:06:47.080 there  
00:06:48.919 sriracha and then there was exos sauce  
00:06:51.759 salsa Mayo garlic Mayo Smoky  
00:06:55.240 Barbecue  
00:06:56.800 mustard and good old tomato sauce  
00:07:00.199 Classics yeah very good what was your  
00:07:03.960 what's your favorite condiment um I get  
00:07:06.879 my most used condim is probably a chili  
00:07:09.840 sauce uh I'm pretty prone to ketchup or  
00:07:12.639 tomato sauce as  
00:07:14.520 well um yeah  
00:07:17.960 but yeah I mean you can't beat like hot  
00:07:20.280 chips and tomato sauce can  
00:07:22.319 you no pretty great I would say my  
00:07:25.240 favorite condiment growing up was  
00:07:26.639 definitely tomato sauce it's probably  
00:07:28.879 the only cond I really ate and we just  
00:07:31.440 had it on everything sausages lamb chops  
00:07:35.599 steak Des even lasagna  
00:07:39.280 sometimes yeah maybe keep that to  
00:07:42.199 yourself I was a kid I like what I like  
00:07:45.159 sugar so you know but I I think  
00:07:49.479 mine I think mine would probably be hot  
00:07:52.120 sauce but I I don't like anything too  
00:07:53.800 spicy so Trula is hot enough yeah it's a  
00:07:58.199 good option  
00:08:00.319 that would be my  
00:08:01.560 pick very good right how's your week

00:09:42.240 this  
00:09:43.800 is I mean would this this would be the  
00:09:46.760 favorite part of your job just cooking  
00:09:49.240 yeah I mean this particularly yeah like  
00:09:51.440 you like this this like playing I guess  
00:09:54.959 I I don't think get to do it as much as  
00:09:56.160 I'd like either  
00:09:59.480 easy cooking the no no no like the  
00:10:01.600 playing like trying to like yeah coming  
00:10:04.320 out with new dishes yeah I  
00:10:07.240 enjoy yeah you need to keep yourself  
00:10:09.959 more time to do  
00:10:11.399 that  
00:10:13.079 yes when you have that opportunity  
00:10:17.600 yes so the lamb I just rendered the fat  
00:10:20.360 out and then just going to seal both  
00:10:23.160 sides we'll cook the lamb like medium I  
00:10:26.200 don't really like lamb  
00:10:28.320 rare don't think  
00:10:30.279 it's tastes particularly good feel like  
00:10:33.279 it gets a bit  
00:10:34.320 chewy I like my L up  
00:10:37.279 medium uh I'm just going to pan fry  
00:10:40.040 these little  
00:10:41.839 baby brussel  
00:10:44.720 sprouts just spitting at  
00:10:48.920 me segments are done that's that's I'll  
00:10:51.959 keep those and make a little dressing  
00:10:53.360 out of it and I actually want these  
00:10:57.320 Sprouts to go pretty black I want a bit  
00:10:59.480 of bitterness from them pretty sweet  
00:11:02.120 anyway so I'll give them a pretty hard  
00:11:06.760 Char and I do want to rest the slam  
00:11:09.920 pretty well also so once we got some  
00:11:13.000 nice color on it these won't take long  
00:11:15.079 cuz they're pretty  
00:11:16.760 thin as soon as we got some nice color  
00:11:19.079 on both sides they'll come out of the  
00:11:20.519 pan and just rest up really  
00:11:23.079 well  
00:11:24.920 um what else do I need to do cut up my  
00:11:28.240 beets I need to blanch these quickly I  
00:11:31.240 got some water over there I don't want  
00:11:33.320 them  
00:11:34.279 like cooked cooked  
00:11:36.680 but also will make them a little bit  
00:11:38.720 more  
00:11:40.920 vibrant cut these beets while I got a  
00:11:45.680 second and then I'll get my yams out  
00:11:48.639 slice  
00:11:50.000 my beetro my raw  
00:11:54.880 beetro see how my rotta is traveling  
00:12:03.639 laughing yes they're looking great um  
00:12:07.760 they can come out that's raw that can  
00:12:09.480 come out this will be my garnish tray  
00:12:12.160 dressing for  
00:12:14.199 that how are these feeling well they're  
00:12:16.440 pretty much  
00:12:18.600 done that was quick quick quick so lamb  
00:12:23.399 should be cooked medium I think so I  
00:12:26.120 think it's I mean all all raw like lamb  
00:12:29.360 is really nice yeah I think rare lamb  
00:12:31.920 I'm not a huge fan of I like it kind of  
00:12:33.800 Yeah medium or medium or raw okay medium  
00:12:38.920 or raw okay yeah for like a loin like  
00:12:42.120 that yeah  
00:12:51.600 yeah there's  
00:12:53.600 my leaves just nicely blanched AP from  
00:12:57.040 that one cuz that was a whole one that  
00:12:58.320 was a mistake  
00:12:59.680 they kind of more like the garnish I  
00:13:01.880 guess okay didn't anything  
00:13:08.800 yep so last week's cake video didn't do  
00:13:13.160 great but that's all

00:13:31.680 probably didn't quite understand it  
00:13:35.399 understandably there was actually a  
00:13:37.519 couple of comments from people I can't  
00:13:40.160 remember the country but and other

00:15:04.680 think we were ever served brussels

00:15:08.600 scarred with how their parents served it  
00:15:11.880 which was boiled until it had zero  
00:15:16.120 flavor I'm just dressing all this in  
00:15:18.480 Lamb fat that I rended off which is a  
00:15:22.560 bit

00:16:51.319 that's it's got an interesting flavor  
00:16:54.440 does it's far more interesting than  
00:16:58.199 potato potato yeah I  
00:17:01.199 agree there was actually a question in  
00:17:03.519 last week's video of why duck is called  
00:17:08.400 duck yeah well you named him I did name  
00:17:10.799 him I was going through a Madman phase  
00:17:14.240 you know the TV show Mad Men I was  
00:17:17.039 watching that there is a character in  
00:17:19.119 there whose name is Duck Phillips I  
00:17:23.679 think his actual name was  
00:17:26.160 Herman but his nickname was Duc I don't  
00:17:29.000 know why I liked it it was either  
00:17:30.559 between that or action for from action  
00:17:33.160 Bron I kind of wish we chose action but  
00:17:35.919 then dark is just being quite funny and  
00:17:38.799 he does when he gets worked up his bark  
00:17:42.080 kind of sounds like a bit of a quack in  
00:17:44.760 a way uh so it just works for him and um  
00:17:49.200 you know I love telling people that he's  
00:17:51.000 when I call him duck and people like  
00:17:52.600 Doug no duck Doug no duck  
00:18:00.000 anyway that's why he's named  
00:18:02.120 duck mad man  
00:18:04.760 character and then Olive when we had her  
00:18:08.280 she I think my sister actually named her  
00:18:12.159 um but kind of worked in the you know  
00:18:15.320 the food category dark and  
00:18:18.559 Olive she she looked like a what's the  
00:18:21.840 dark dark camata she look like a camata  
00:18:24.919 olive she did look like a camata olive  
00:18:27.080 yeah all right time to  
00:18:29.840 play wooo just put a bit olive oil on  
00:18:39.559 that and a little bit of balsamic

00:19:55.840 Timber anyway there's a few different  
00:19:57.480 Timbers you can choose but this one is  
00:19:59.520 Timber and is it good to cook on uh yeah  
00:20:03.400 me I like it it's nice and um tactile  
00:20:07.679 they did a fair few coat protective  
00:20:09.600 coats on top of it yeah um just  
00:20:13.240 to stop damage or oil sort of seeping  
00:20:16.679 down into it but yeah it's nice it's  
00:20:20.159 kind of the light feature of the  
00:20:22.520 kitchen um and they also  
00:20:25.159 asked  
00:20:27.640 um what is your thought on different  
00:20:30.880 types of kitchen  
00:20:33.360 benches what does that mean I don't know  
00:20:35.720 H is there anything you don't like like  
00:20:38.280 no for a kitchen bench not really I like  
00:20:40.159 staying steel a lot at the moment um and  
00:20:44.080 it kind of that's pretty work well it's  
00:20:46.960 hygienic it's durable  
00:20:49.840 yeah um the wood's not like super  
00:20:52.640 durable and it's but you know it is what  
00:20:55.919 it is but I think having a massive  
00:20:58.840 chopping board that you have on top of  
00:21:01.080 this kitchen bench helps yeah with the  
00:21:03.880 upkey while keeping the bench clean  
00:21:07.159 Y what about I mean I think stone is  
00:21:10.760 very common for people to use um or lonx  
00:21:15.360 I think with a lot of the light Stones  
00:21:17.440 the lemonex is pretty impressive we're  
00:21:18.600 in a lemonex showroom yesterday it was  
00:21:20.760 yeah it was it's uh it's come a long way  
00:21:24.480 has some cool colors and materials and  
00:21:27.760 um  
00:21:29.360 yeah some amazing stuff in there  
00:21:32.480 actually  
00:21:34.559 uh yeah and then I guess black sometimes  
00:21:38.640 I don't know depending on Black Stone  
00:21:40.840 might be all right we find with um our  
00:21:43.520 black cabinets are pretty you can just  
00:21:45.279 see marks fingerprint on them um so  
00:21:49.880 maybe that' be an issue for piing Benes  
00:21:51.840 but oh you right why is there's a  
00:21:56.039 bug it's chess in the bug  
00:22:01.919 yeah  
00:22:04.919 um sorry why you're trying to  
00:22:07.000 concentrate all the questions are for  
00:22:08.320 you go for it I can do two things at  
00:22:11.240 once any nasty kitchen injuries and how  
00:22:14.760 did you recover um no I haven't had any  
00:22:17.640 like real Crazy Ones the the craziest  
00:22:21.360 it's not really a kitchen I was riding  
00:22:23.320 home from work one night in London mhm  
00:22:25.960 and a taxi did a u-turn in front of me  
00:22:28.200 and I  
00:22:29.400 a middle was riding a fixi bike with no  
00:22:31.159 brakes so I didn't stop fast enough went  
00:22:34.000 over it and woke up in hospital but as  
00:22:37.039 far as actual kitchen  
00:22:39.279 injuries lots of cuts y  
00:22:43.640 um I had my ego bashed up a  
00:22:47.400 bit few times few things thrown at you  
00:22:51.159 yeah you know you been called every name  
00:22:53.960 under the sun yeah but that's all right  
00:22:57.200 you saw a few nasty jues though over  
00:22:59.240 your time right yeah yeah I think I've  
00:23:00.720 talked about them them the craziest one  
00:23:02.760 I saw was a guy Sashimi Chef cutting  
00:23:05.000 Sashimi used to always wipe his a shimy  
00:23:07.520 knife on his apron and I used to tell  
00:23:10.000 him off for it be like that and then cuz  
00:23:12.400 one day he kind of was busy and instead  
00:23:14.039 of wiing like that he went like that and  
00:23:15.919 shimmy knife is very sharp very sharp  
00:23:18.440 just went straight through his leg oh I  
00:23:21.080 kind of like brushed it off and was like  
00:23:22.720 I told you so and then I turned around  
00:23:24.159 all the blood and I was like ah someone  
00:23:25.760 probably needs to get him to the  
00:23:26.720 hospital  
00:23:31.240 all right d but you recovered he still  
00:23:34.520 alive as far as I know came back to the  
00:23:36.600 kitchen eventually yeah eventually  
00:23:40.200 yeah  
00:23:42.000 um any advice if someone who's opening a  
00:23:46.520 restaurant M for  
00:23:50.880 approaching uh creating the menu  
00:23:55.159 o um  
00:23:58.799 just be honest to yourself be true to  
00:24:01.200 yourself if you can't plate food like  
00:24:04.960 that uh consistently or if you can't do  
00:24:07.840 something consistently don't put on the  
00:24:10.600 menu be be honest about where you're  
00:24:13.320 targeting in the market if you're a  
00:24:15.400 local like brro do local berro food  
00:24:19.720 maybe elevate it if you're a local pub  
00:24:21.200 do local you're local cafe don't try and  
00:24:23.760 do something crazy yeah think about uh  
00:24:27.600 youve got a you've got to cover all  
00:24:29.720 dietes and requests now you know so you  
00:24:32.039 have to have vegan options and all that  
00:24:34.840 stuff um whereas in the past you kind of  
00:24:37.279 get away with it mhm  
00:24:40.720 um yeah as Matt Lambert says inspiration  
00:24:44.640 is everywhere Matt lamit says it it's  
00:24:47.000 Matt Lam's favorite thing right  
00:24:49.370 [Music]  
00:24:50.559 okay um one more  
00:24:53.919 question someone if someone didn't have  
00:24:56.320 experience in hospo mhm but they do cook  
00:24:59.320 at home mhm how would they go about  
00:25:01.440 approaching a restaurant for  
00:25:03.760 experience they're going to Melbourne  
00:25:05.520 for a few months and want some  
00:25:07.600 experience in a restaurant start at the  
00:25:09.960 bottom how would you and do you have any  
00:25:12.640 Melbourne restaurant recommendations for  
00:25:14.760 them to approach go go to the mall but I  
00:25:17.039 mean start at the bottom do restaurants  
00:25:18.760 take on people who have  
00:25:20.840 zero not not a good restaurant no  
00:25:23.720 they'll take you on as a pot wash okay  
00:25:25.880 but they're not going to take you on put  
00:25:26.799 you in the kitchen no not not at a good  
00:25:28.880 restaurant and I don't think it's worth  
00:25:29.919 doing at a bad  
00:25:31.279 restaurant okay if that makes sense  
00:25:33.919 right bad habits even if you're like an  
00:25:36.720 avid home cook they'll be looking  
00:25:39.520 they're looking for culinary school or  
00:25:41.559 experience somewhere else y so the best  
00:25:43.880 bet if you want to if you're really  
00:25:45.640 serious about it and you really want to  
00:25:47.120 get into a kitchen your best bet is to  
00:25:49.200 go get a pot wash job um and way work  
00:25:53.480 your way up you know like and it's also  
00:25:55.240 a good thing to do if you're like I'm  
00:25:56.480 great I'm a good home cook and I love  
00:25:58.720 and I'm interested in this go work in a  
00:26:01.039 pot wash you're going to know what it's  
00:26:02.080 like real quickly you're going to see it  
00:26:03.360 all and you're either going to go I'm in  
00:26:06.080 you're either a freak like the chefs and  
00:26:08.679 you go man I want this lifestyle yeah or  
00:26:10.960 you're not and you go I'm out yeah okay  
00:26:15.399 so don't yeah before you take a bigger  
00:26:17.279 leap and do something crazy quit your  
00:26:21.000 job I think they would just coming for  
00:26:23.200 like a year or something so we'll just  
00:26:25.440 go work in the pot wash and you'll if if  
00:26:27.480 you're if you work  
00:26:29.840 hard and you're efficient and you're  
00:26:31.760 eager they'll quickly pull you out of  
00:26:33.720 pot wash put you in prep okay so you got  
00:26:36.039 pot wash then you become a prep shift so  
00:26:37.520 you're literally picking herbs putting  
00:26:39.520 stock away stuff like that mhm and then  
00:26:43.000 at some point if you you're going to  
00:26:44.640 want to get some qualifications
