1:31  
along with the wider template connected  
1:34  
to it it's a complete reworking of my  
1:37  
previous simplified notion template the  
1:40  
new version now includes my prompted  
1:42  
goal setting template this new habit  
1:44  
tracker a simple task in project manager  
1:46  
as well as a prompted stoic Journal so  
PART 1: The Fundamentals of Habits Tracking, Goal Setting & Behaviour Change  
1:48  
part one the fundamentals goals systems  
1:51  
and designing Behavior so the idea of  
1:53  
Lifestyle design and behavior design has  
1:56  
been around for a long time now in the  
1:57  
productivity space it's about finding  
1:59  
way is to make more happen with less  
2:01  
championing efficiency over effort and  
2:05  
building sustainable focused habits that  
2:07  
gradually lead you closer to the life  
2:09  
you want for me at the heart of this is  
2:12  
honing goals and Building Systems that  
2:14  
help you reach them so the idea is that  
2:16  
it ensures we put our energy in the  
2:18  
right place day to day and ensures that  
2:20  
our actions naturally Point towards the  
2:22  
life that we choose so what's that got  
2:24  
to do with notion pretty simple as James  
2:27  
Clear famously talks about in his book  
2:28  
Atomic habits it's the systems that we  
2:31  
fall back on that really make the  
2:33  
difference Stanford's behavioral  
2:34  
scientist BJ fogg's concept of the  
2:36  
information action fallacy in his book  
2:39  
tiny habits is great on reminding us  
2:41  
that if we have a strong enough  
2:43  
knowledge and ownership of why we should  
2:45  
make a change we're far more likely to  
2:47  
be able to make it and I believe the  
Goal Setting Notion Template & Yearly Reviews  
2:50  
best way to do this is to reflect and  
2:52  
review on your previous year in order to  
2:54  
identify what you want to build on and  
2:57  
change in the next so I recommend  
2:59  
starting with a yearly reflection or a  
3:01  
reflection on what's gone well or less  
3:03  
well in a previous period and then you  
3:05  
can better judge the habits you want to  
3:07  
set and why I won't dive deep into goal  
3:10  
setting in this video but you might  
3:11  
enjoy my step-by-step video guide doing  
3:13  
a yearly review that's listed in the  
3:15  
description so I built this kind of goal  
3:17  
setting template that prompts me through  
3:19  
it in notion to find inspiring  
3:21  
actionable goals that align with your  
3:23  
personal Vision or values that is most  
3:25  
important knowing why so once we have  
3:27  
our goals set we can identify the  
3:29  
milestones and regular practices or  
3:31  
habits that are going to get us there  
3:32  
basically the fundamental idea is that  
3:35  
you reverse engineer the process and  
3:38  
identify the small regular actions you  
3:40  
can take each day ensuring that your  
3:42  
energy is pointing in the right  
3:44  
direction and you've created a system  
3:45  
you can fall back on to make sure you  
3:48  
track it and get it done now BJ fogg's  
Structuring Habits In Your System: Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg  
3:50  
tiny habits book also has a great  
3:52  
approach to structuring how we build new  
3:54  
habits and it's a big inspiration for my  
3:56  
notion habit tracker setup using ABC you  
3:59  
anchor The Habit to a point in your  
4:01  
regular routine Express the tiny  
4:04  
Behavior shift in it that's in its  
4:06  
simplest form and then find a meaningful  
4:08  
way to Simply celebrate when you've  
4:10  
executed so here's how fogg's concept is  
4:13  
baked into my notion template I set up  
4:15  
relations between my goals and projects  
4:18  
and habits that will get me there so I  
4:20  
know that reverse engineering is working  
4:23  
and they will link back to the strong  
4:25  
why from the goals database I simply add  
4:28  
a relation column select the Habit  
4:30  
tracker and connect them now each habit  
4:33  
I create I can link back to the goal  
4:35  
nice and so the habit tracker the idea  
Notion Habit Tracker Tour  
4:39  
is I can set up a new habit let's say  
4:41  
it's a regular reading practice set the  
4:43  
frequency such as three times a week and  
4:46  
then the duration I'm going to track it  
4:48  
for maybe a year let's say August the  
4:50  
1st to August the 1st for example each  
4:53  
time I complete a habit I can have a  
4:55  
little Celebration by well ticking a box  
4:57  
adding to the counter or even so  
4:59  
selecting The Habit as a relation and  
5:02  
linking it to a daily log page I'll show  
5:04  
you how all that works later on the  
5:06  
reporting view lets me know how many  
5:08  
I've logged when I last logged it and  
5:11  
the progress I've made so far with that  
PART 2: Step-by Step Notion Build Tutorial: Getting Started  
5:13  
progress bar right time to build this  
5:15  
one feel free to pause the video and  
5:17  
work along with me I've tried to keep  
5:18  
this tutorial clean and simple but I  
5:20  
find it's better to share the steps and  
5:22  
then give you time to pause the video  
5:24  
and do the work so these don't become  
5:26  
massively long videos let's do it so  
5:28  
building a habit tracker we're going to  
5:30  
build this this reporting View and if I  
5:32  
click through to the main page this  
5:34  
entire build here along with these cards  
5:37  
that report alongside that we also have  
5:40  
a default new habit template which we're  
5:44  
going to create so every time you click  
5:45  
a new one of these it sets up the basics  
5:47  
and inside these you'll see they have a  
5:52  
range of different details and you can  
5:54  
list different things now you might  
5:57  
notice with my templates I build build  
6:00  
my systems by creating all of the main  
6:02  
databases in a systems menu inside the  
6:06  
main dashboard of my system and because  
6:09  
this video is part of a series where  
6:11  
we're going to build an entire life OS  
6:13  
second brain system in steps I wanted to  
6:17  
do that for this to show you how to do  
6:19  
it so we're going to start with the  
6:20  
Habit tracker the reason that's really  
6:22  
good is it means that when it's in your  
6:24  
bar it just is all contained within a  
6:27  
single drop down menu and it makes  
6:28  
things a lot cleaner in your system and  
6:31  
you navigate everything within it using  
6:34  
the buttons that you can create here  
6:35  
these menus and so on and so forth but  
Life OS HomeScreen: Setting Up Pages & Databases In Notion  
6:38  
first off today let's just create this  
6:41  
main home screen and Intuit place a  
6:44  
habit tracker and build it so to do that  
6:46  
I'm going to go out of that main thing  
6:48  
and I'm going to create a new one here  
6:50  
we're going to do wherever you want to  
6:51  
start building forward slash page and  
6:53  
create a new page empty with icon we're  
6:56  
going to go up to the dots in the top  
6:57  
corner and make it full width and I'm  
7:00  
going to add a cover  
7:01  
and you can select a cover and I'm going  
7:04  
to add an icon notion have created their  
7:06  
own new icons within here so you could  
7:09  
create your own custom set I'm going to  
7:10  
be doing that soon but first let's use  
7:13  
Notions icons this is a home screen use  
7:15  
the home and let's make it a blue theme  
7:18  
in this system name it you can call it  
7:21  
home whatever you want I'm going to call  
7:22  
it my life OS 2022 how about that now  
7:27  
within this system we're going to do  
7:29  
various things you might want to put an  
7:32  
inspirational quote but what we're going  
7:34  
to do first of all is go forward slash  
7:36  
tog select toggle and we're going to  
7:39  
call this one system menu  
7:43  
drop it in underneath I'm going to make  
7:45  
it  
7:45  
bold and I'm going to insert into there  
7:48  
a little Emoji now you could try  
7:51  
function to bring that up or depending  
7:54  
on what you use  
7:55  
you can also go up to the edit menu and  
7:58  
select emojis and symbols if you're  
8:01  
using Mac I think it's something like  
8:04  
command full stop command period if  
8:07  
you're using Windows so into here I'm  
8:10  
going to select function and I'm going  
8:12  
to put a little  
8:14  
for the system menu so in our  
8:17  
system menu we can now do forward slash  
8:20  
database and I want a database full page  
8:23  
let's add an icon this is going to be  
8:25  
our habit tracker so I'm going to use a  
8:27  
cross make it blue like everything else  
8:29  
call it my habits let's add a cover so  
8:34  
I'm going to rename this as just the  
8:36  
main name for the view my habit tracker  
8:39  
let's now put in the main functions  
8:42  
first of all change the name of name to  
8:45  
habits this one we're going to make a  
8:47  
number so you're going to change the  
8:49  
type to a number property and this one  
8:53  
is going to be called log so where we're  
8:56  
going to log habits now again I quite  
8:58  
like with this for a look to use the  
9:01  
emojis and symbols and if you go right  
9:04  
down to the bottom of them you'll find  
9:05  
these kind of interesting emojis that  
9:07  
are even a bit cleaner and that's how  
9:08  
I'm gonna make mine look like this a  
9:11  
pencil a little cross it just makes me  
9:14  
it distinctive pretty cool I don't want  
9:16  
that saw and I don't know why it did it  
9:18  
but let's just delete the saw so you've  
9:20  
got the Habit the lock now for this the  
9:23  
way it's going to work is we're just  
9:24  
follow me through and we'll put them all  
9:25  
in we want a start date  
9:27  
I'm going to click for a new thing find  
9:30  
a date column  
9:32  
start date there it is we want an end  
9:35  
date date  
9:37  
another column this one is going to be a  
9:41  
number and you're going to call this one  
9:43  
target  
9:45  
per week that will make sense in a  
9:48  
moment you can adjust these columns so  
9:50  
that they take up less space now we're  
Habit Tracking Formulas: Creating Formulas In Notion  
9:53  
going to add a formula this is where it  
9:55  
gets exciting because we want to  
9:56  
calculate how long you're doing this for  
9:59  
in weeks this is going to be called  
10:00  
duration in weeks to do this Formula  
10:04  
First of all let's just put in a couple  
10:06  
of things we're going to put the start  
10:07  
date I'm putting mine as the first of  
10:09  
September you can format that if you  
10:11  
want by clicking on here and for example  
10:14  
go for day month year which I prefer and  
10:18  
let's just do the same on this  
10:20  
updating format  
10:22  
very much yeah  
10:23  
very British approach let's set a date  
10:27  
to finish which is one year later let's  
10:30  
change the end number and I'm going to  
10:32  
set a target of weeks of three let's now  
10:34  
make the formula you're going to go in  
10:35  
here and you're going to click on here  
10:37  
and type date B and you'll see date  
10:40  
between and it will give us the means to  
10:43  
do it date between needed date one date  
10:45  
two and then in how and what you want it  
10:47  
to do years quarters months weeks we're  
10:49  
gonna go for weeks so we're aiming to  
10:51  
copy that  
10:52  
so you're going to do it like this it's  
10:55  
pretty instinctive date between  
10:58  
when it ends  
11:00  
comma  
11:02  
from when it starts comma  
11:05  
open the parentheses and we're going to  
11:06  
do weeks  
11:08  
close it  
11:11  
and you know it's work because that blue  
11:13  
done comes up and there you go 52 that  
11:16  
is correct right 52 weeks between those  
11:19  
two dates is a year great formula number  
11:22  
two so from this you have a means to log  
11:25  
it and you want to calculate what your  
11:28  
target is for this habit so you've got  
11:32  
the number of times per week you can do  
11:34  
that as much as you like the start and  
11:36  
end date and how long it's going to last  
11:38  
so we can therefore calculate the total  
11:41  
Target we're aiming to hit between those  
11:43  
dates so we're going to add another  
11:45  
formula here  
11:47  
and we're going to call this  
11:49  
total Target this is really simple if  
11:52  
you think about it you want to do the  
11:55  
target per week  
11:57  
space A Little Star for times  
12:01  
duration in weeks  
12:03  
that's it simple calculation there you  
12:05  
go three times a week times 52 weeks is  
12:09  
156. that's going to allow us to create  
12:11  
reports based on the comparison between  
12:14  
what we've logged which we just simply  
12:16  
do by doing that  
12:18  
and the total Target really simple so  
New Habit Template Page: Creating Database Templates In Notion  
12:21  
next up you might want to start adding  
12:23  
some habits to see how this works but  
12:25  
rather than do that manually here I want  
12:28  
us to create first of all a template  
12:30  
page now a template page in a database  
12:32  
if you're brand new to this means that  
12:34  
we can create a page so that every time  
12:37  
we add a new thing it will give us the  
12:40  
contents of that page so you could make  
12:41  
this really complex or really simple I'm  
12:44  
just doing it for this one to start off  
12:46  
with to make it really visual but if we  
12:49  
move on to something like projects in  
12:51  
your builds you can then create  
12:52  
reporting views within the projects of  
12:55  
other related evidence and information  
12:57  
so new template and we're going to call  
13:00  
this new habit you can see here it says  
13:03  
you're editing a template now what I  
13:05  
want to do is add an icon  
13:08  
and we're going to make that a similar  
13:11  
icon I think a little cross in blue  
13:14  
now one option with this would be to  
13:16  
just change the color so it has a kind  
13:18  
of um hierarchy if you wanted to so for  
13:21  
example I might just make the habits  
13:22  
orange now we're going to add a cover  
13:25  
and the reason I want to do that is just  
13:27  
want a clean simple cover for our  
13:29  
Gallery views later on so we're going to  
13:31  
change the cover this is just for the  
13:32  
template so if you've never changed it  
13:34  
it would work for everything so I'm just  
13:36  
keeping mine really simple by typing  
13:38  
white clicking that first image of  
13:40  
something white it could be whatever you  
13:42  
want for a habit but I like it you might  
13:45  
find a tick box somewhere or something  
13:46  
or your own image now you can also  
13:48  
pre-fill these in for example I might  
13:51  
want to set the basic Target per week to  
13:55  
always be three and you could change it  
13:57  
it's up to you but for now I'm just  
13:59  
going to leave it like that one more  
14:01  
thing to do with the Habit is to change  
14:03  
the default this is a new feature that's  
14:05  
recently come out if you clicked new  
14:07  
over here you would just have an empty  
14:09  
page but we're going to go here and set  
14:11  
that as default for All Views in my  
14:14  
habits and now if you add a new one  
14:18  
you should see let's call this  
14:21  
running  
14:23  
comes up with the icon if we open it  
14:25  
it's all formatted as we wanted it to be  
14:28  
and of course you can change covers and  
14:29  
so on and so forth pretty cool let's  
14:32  
call this one  
14:34  
meditation obviously that was created  
14:36  
without  
14:39  
but you can put it in like that now what  
14:41  
I really like to do is for each of my  
14:43  
habits is change the cover so that it  
14:45  
looks correct so for running I'm going  
14:48  
to put in  
14:49  
start date same end date  
14:53  
same Target per week is three runs  
14:57  
why don't we make meditation seven and  
15:00  
you'll see the calculations are precise  
Habit Tracker Reports: Creating & Using Notion Progress Bars  
15:04  
so we've got some Basics but now I want  
15:06  
to show you this this is my original I  
15:09  
want to start creating the progress bar  
15:11  
that we've got and these reports so  
15:14  
that's going to be the next stage and  
15:16  
this a habit reporting card view now  
15:19  
this is really how I would generally use  
15:22  
it day to day on the main dashboard so  
15:24  
you've got a nice clean view of what  
15:26  
we've created the reporting views which  
15:28  
are using these concat formulas and then  
15:30  
you can click through and just simply  
15:33  
lock things and see all the information  
15:34  
some other stuff we'll do in a bit so  
15:37  
let's go back to where we're building  
15:38  
and we're going to first of all create a  
15:41  
new formula and this is going to go down  
15:43  
here and go formula and you're going to  
15:45  
call this one progress now we need this  
15:49  
to come out in order to use these new  
15:51  
progress reporting views that we've got  
15:53  
here these little circles or bars or  
15:55  
whatever you want as a number now this  
15:57  
is simple formula we're going to click  
16:00  
in here and we're going to type in floor  
16:02  
you can use round but floor will take it  
16:05  
down to a kind of below a decimal which  
16:08  
is really nice if it's 2.8 it will just  
16:10  
give you two it's a nicer use than round  
16:13  
so we're going to do floor  
16:16  
of the log forward slash so that's  
16:19  
divided by our total Target  
16:24  
times  
16:26  
100  
16:28  
close the brackets off that'll just give  
16:30  
us one and then we want to divide that  
16:33  
by 100. done so that's give us given us  
16:36  
a percentage let's just put some numbers  
16:38  
in here so we get an example 17 one  
16:41  
percent so on and so forth It's not  
16:44  
reading brilliantly yet right so now  
16:45  
you're going to click onto the thing and  
16:47  
you edit property we just have to click  
16:49  
number format  
16:51  
and you can set it to what you want we  
16:53  
want percent that will give you the  
16:55  
percentage report and then these amazing  
16:57  
new bar or ring visuals you can set the  
17:01  
color you want it to be so let's make it  
17:04  
orange since that seems to be our look  
17:06  
and you can even remove the number or  
17:09  
show the number depending on how you  
17:11  
want it to show I really like just  
17:13  
having it nice and clean like that and  
17:16  
just having that kind of ring report so  
17:18  
we're going to do that why not let's  
17:20  
show the percentage cool so to show how  
Using Notion Gallery Views: Creating A Habit Reporting View  
17:22  
this could look good let's go and add  
17:24  
another view to The Habit tracker so I'm  
17:27  
going to click here and create a new tab  
17:29  
I'm going to come across and we're going  
17:31  
to call this  
17:32  
habit report and we're going to make it  
17:35  
a gallery and you'll see it's nice and  
17:37  
clean at the moment so you want to come  
17:38  
down here change the card preview to the  
17:41  
page cover and you'll see the visuals  
17:43  
that we set earlier then you can come  
17:45  
back out of there  
17:46  
click on the dots again and go to  
17:48  
properties  
17:50  
and you want to work out which of them  
17:53  
you want to see so I want to see  
17:55  
progress at the moment that's all I want  
17:58  
to see so there you go that gives you a  
An Intro To Concat Formulas In Notion  
18:00  
simple report now we've got the log  
18:02  
right we could see the log and we can  
18:05  
see the total Target kind of because  
18:07  
when you have number properties showing  
18:09  
up in galleries they don't tell you what  
18:11  
they are and that is why we use concat  
18:14  
formulas like these so that when you see  
18:16  
them on the report card they look really  
18:19  
good so in the next part of this build I  
18:21  
will show you how to do that well hey  
18:23  
this is a big build and you have  
18:25  
completed the first section I'm going to  
18:27  
move this into a second video now so if  
18:29  
you want to come back and continue the  
18:31  
build make sure you're subscribed and  
18:33  
you have those notifications turned on  
18:34  
so you can see the next one next week or  
18:36  
I'll link it here if it's already out  
18:39  
brilliant let me know in the comments  
18:41  
below how it's going  
18:42  
see you on the next one
