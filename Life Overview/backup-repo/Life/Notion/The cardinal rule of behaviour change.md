  

### The cardinal rule of behaviour change

==**If an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason to repeat it**==

  

==**What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided**==

==**Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them**==

  

==**The first 3 laws of behaviour change - make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy -**== ==**increase the odds that a behaviour will be performed this time.**==

  

==**The 4th law of behaviour change - make it satisfying -**== ==**increases the odds that a behaviour will be repeated next time.**==

  

==**It completes the habit loop**==

  

==**For this to work we need immediate satisfaction**==

  

### The mismatch between immediate and delayed rewards

  

> ==**The costs of your bad habits are in the future**==

  

==**What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.**==

  

==**Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction.**==

  

==**The road less travelled is the road of delayed gratification**==

  

==**If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff.**==

  

==**As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded**==

### How to turn instant gratification to your advantage

  

==**The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful.**==

  

==**The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off and that the work was worth the effort**==

  

==**The best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behaviour**==

  

==**Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish**==

  

==**Open a savings account and label it for something you want. Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of money in the account.**== ==You are making it satisfying to do nothing==

  

==**It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it**==

  

==**Now the short-term reward is aligned with your long-term vision of being a healthy person**==

  

==**Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and reduced stress kicks in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward.**==

  

==**The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. you do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you.**==

  

==**The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through.**==

  

> ==**Incentives can start a habit, identity sustains it**==

  

==**A habits needs to be enjoyable for it to last, because change is easy when it’s enjoyable**==
