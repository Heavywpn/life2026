Transcipt: "# http://tactiq.io/ free youtube transcript# you need to monitor your stuff RIGHT NOW!! (free)# https://www.youtube.com/watch/DbF96IHOZig00:00:00.000 You've gotta see this tool. It's nuts.I can finally monitor all my stuff,00:00:04.540 all of it websites, DNS servers likeAgar game servers, raspberry pies.00:00:08.960 My kids don't make controllers.Everything in my home lab,00:00:11.600 everything in my cloud, I can see ifit's up and running or if it goes down,00:00:15.630 I finally feel like I know what's goingon and I don't even have to look at it.00:00:19.400 It'll just tell me Slack, discord,whatever this is uptime kua.00:00:23.920 A monitoring tool you cannotbelieve is free. And honestly,00:00:26.800 I would've killed four back in the day.Two reasons. You're going to love this.00:00:30.140 One, it's free. Two, it's beautiful.Come on, look at all this. And I lied.00:00:35.040 Three reasons. Three, it'sreally easy to set up.00:00:37.640 You're gonna host it yourself and by thetime you're done, you'll be like, wait,00:00:40.400 that was it. Not kidding. Five minutes.Get your stinking coffee ready.00:00:43.800 Let's do this. Now first you gottadecide where are you going to put uptime?00:00:47.640 Kuma, you got two choices. One the cloud.And number two, inside your home lab.00:00:51.800 Your home network.00:00:52.440 Now inside is cool because you caneasily monitor all your home lab stuff00:00:55.560 without even thinking about it. You don'thave to poke holes in that firewall.00:00:57.980 And you'll need somewhere to host Uptime,Kua, some kind of Linux based server,00:01:01.320 like a Raspberry Pie, a spare laptopor an enterprise grade server.00:01:04.239 But once you got a place to put it,00:01:05.560 installing is stupid easy cuz we'regonna use Docker. And Docker is amazing.00:01:08.880 It would be like that coffee breakthat's, that's how long it'll take Arrow,00:01:12.760 Chuck. Now the cloud is cooltoo. You put it up there,00:01:15.620 you don't really need anything.00:01:16.920 You can set it up right now as you'rewatching this video and just kind of play00:01:19.520 with it, just like see if it's cool.00:01:21.040 And if you use one of my favorite cloudproviders and the sponsor of this video00:01:24.130 LE Node, it'll cost you almostnothing like 0.08 cents an hour.00:01:28.170 Or if you're new to Le Node,00:01:29.240 it'll be free because they giveyou $100 credit for 60 days. I,00:01:33.360 that's just do it.00:01:35.450 So put it in the cloud and you canmonitor everything on the interwebs.00:01:38.520 You just might have a bit of a problemmonitoring your home lab stuff. Now me,00:01:41.790 I do both. I've got uptime,00:01:43.280 coma sitting right next to me in myhome lab monitoring all the things.00:01:46.080 But I also have one in thecloud redundancy also, I,00:01:48.560 I monitor my home network to see ifit stays up. Whatever you choose,00:01:51.160 it doesn't matter. I'm gonna show youboth and it's, it's pretty stink and easy.00:01:54.000 I'll start with the cloud because ittakes like three seconds and you can't go00:01:56.640 wrong with LE node. I got a link below.Head over to le http://node.com/network. Chuck,00:02:00.440 again, if you're new, you'llget a $100 credit for 60 days.00:02:03.680 And once you're signed in,click on create the node.00:02:06.820 Now why this will be so fast isbecause they have a marketplace.00:02:09.520 Go and click on that and it's gonnabe like, where is it? abcV, oh,00:02:13.800 uptime Kuma right there. Just selectit, scroll down a bit, put in some info.00:02:17.520 Email address, limitedpseudo user info, password.00:02:20.740 You can skip over the DNS stuffif you don't want to use it,00:02:23.280 I'm not gonna use it rightnow. Select your region,00:02:25.190 I'll be in Dallas close to me. Andthen pick the size of your LE node,00:02:28.720 your server. I'm gonna doshared CPU nano one gigabyte,00:02:31.360 which is five bucks a month or0.01 cents an hour. So seriously,00:02:35.040 if you wanna try this out, justspin this up, play it for an hour,00:02:37.800 then delete it and you're charged thatmuch like that's it. Then label it.00:02:42.200 And dude, that's it.00:02:43.240 Click on create and take a little coffeebreak cuz you just set up a monitoring00:02:47.040 service that's gonna take a fewminutes to get baked and ready.00:02:49.480 So while it's baking,00:02:50.200 let me show you how to do the on-premsetup in the home lab. So for on-prem,00:02:54.320 I'm gonna get connectedto my on-prem server.00:02:56.480 We're gonna launch CMDon Windows Terminal.00:02:58.800 On Mac and Linux, SSH andSumi server. And I'm in.00:03:02.160 Now this install will depend on twothings, Docker and Docker compose.00:03:05.640 Let's make sure we havethose installed right now.00:03:07.440 Pseudo apt install docker.iodash y. I'm already good.00:03:11.880 Yours might take a minute. Justtake a little coffee break. Next.00:03:14.000 Docker compose. Pseudo a PT.Install Docker dash compos dash y.00:03:18.720 Now that was the hard part. Now watchDucker compose. Just do its thing.00:03:22.000 You ready? The first thing we'lldo is make a new directory, MK dir.00:03:25.230 I'll call it Makua. And thenwe'll CD into that CD Makua.00:03:29.460 And then we'll create one file.00:03:30.800 I'm gonna use Nano cause Nano is thebest fight me. Come on. Just kidding.00:03:35.220 But really I lost mytrade of thought. Nano.00:03:37.400 We'll call this dockerdash compose dot y ml.00:03:41.060 And here we're just gonna copyand paste. I got some code below.00:03:43.960 I'm gonna grab mine. I believe thisis the official stuff from Lewis Lamb,00:03:47.320 the creator of Uptime Kuma. Thatdude's amazing. Thank you Lewis.00:03:51.830 I love your tool. Now real quick,00:03:53.360 here's all we're doing withthe Docker composed file.00:03:55.200 First we're pulling the officialcontainer image from Lewis Lamb for uptime00:03:58.400 Kuma. Then we're naming itUptime Kuma. And then right here,00:04:00.960 this is very important.00:04:01.840 We're mapping a volume to make sure thatour uptime coma data is persistent even00:04:06.400 if we tear down that containerand build it back up.00:04:08.280 And then finally we expose some ports.00:04:10.330 So now that we know what we're doing andwe have a little sip of coffee, right,00:04:13.400 let's go ahead and hit control X,Y enter to save and check the out.00:04:18.200 This is all we have to do. Type in docker,00:04:20.769 compose up dash D. That'sit. You ready? .00:04:25.820 Now that was faster for me cuz Ialready had the image downloaded.00:04:28.560 It'll probably download the image for you.00:04:30.120 It'll be fairly quick And it'srunning If we do a little docker Ps,00:04:34.640 there he is, he's right there.00:04:36.090 So now all we have to do is navigate tothe IP address of our container on Port00:04:40.680 3001. Let's try it out. And here we areready to get set up. Now on LE node,00:04:45.230 it's even easier if youlook back at your LE node,00:04:47.920 all you need to do is go to the networksettings under your lin node settings00:04:52.200 stuff and scroll down just a bit untilyou see the reverse DNS information right00:04:56.880 here. That's basically a free DNSname you get if you copy that bad boy00:05:02.020 and paste that into a new tab.Uptime kua, you're ready to go.00:05:05.800 Now for the remainder of this lab, Iwill continue on my home lab setup.00:05:08.880 However, it'll be the exact sameas the cloud. So just follow along,00:05:12.560 get your username and stuff setup. You know how to do this stuff.00:05:15.400 Password in and click on create mypasswords don't match. Okay, there we go.00:05:19.980 Now here it is Uptime kua.00:05:21.720 And what you're gonna love about this ishow simple it is. Like what do you say,00:05:24.480 we monitor something right now. Let'sdo it right now we have nothing.00:05:26.720 So we'll click on add a new monitor. Andif you're new to enterprise monitoring,00:05:30.080 which is just crazy to say that we haveenterprise monitoring and our home lab.00:05:33.000 Come on guys, if you're new to it, wehave different types. If we look at 'em,00:05:36.360 there's a lot. And what you'll usedepends on what you need it for right now.00:05:39.200 What do you say? We monitor http://networkchuck.com/. So we'll choose http,00:05:42.550 dual friendly name, put in the url.00:05:44.690 We can change how often we wantto check sixty's too long for me.00:05:47.800 Let's do like 30 or something better.00:05:50.080 You can tell it to retry a few moretimes before it considers it down.00:05:53.000 Zero's fine for me. I want it to be upall the time. Tell me when it's not up.00:05:56.120 And you got a few more values. Values.Let's jump on down to advanced.00:05:58.560 And this is pretty cool. Ifyou're monitoring your website,00:06:00.680 it's good to know if your certificate'sgoing to expire. This will tell you.00:06:04.240 Click that sucker. Also,00:06:05.360 if you're monitoring a website insideyour home lab that has a self-signed cert,00:06:08.640 you can tell it to ignore SSLcertificates, but I don't need that.00:06:11.840 And then no matter whatmonitor you choose,00:06:13.240 you'll always have the upside downloadas an option. Which essentially means,00:06:16.440 hey, is your service down? Then it'sup. Often you probably won't need it,00:06:19.880 but there are use cases. Now everythingelse you really don't need to change.00:06:22.800 But I do wanna point outhow powerful this tool is.00:06:25.260 You can tell it what statuscodes it'll accept as up.00:06:28.840 Now these are all HTTP status codesand by default it's gonna say, Hey,00:06:32.080 if we get anything in the 200 range,00:06:33.520 we're okay because 200 okay isthe best message in the world.00:06:37.000 That's what happens when you go toa website and it's up and running,00:06:39.360 you try to pull up a homepagelike network http://chuck.com/.00:06:41.560 And if network http://chuck.com/ is thereand alive and active and working,00:06:45.080 it'll send back all your good stuff.The homepage along with the 200.00:06:49.440 Okay message. Anything elsethat we might have a problem.00:06:51.480 And in case you're curious,00:06:53.160 anything in the 400 rangeas far as response codes goindicates there's an issue00:06:57.320 with the client, which is you,the problem's, you, your computer,00:07:00.400 the way it's trying to receiveinformation. Anything in the 500 range,00:07:03.880 it's a problem with thesite, it's a server issue,00:07:05.800 which if you're hosting your ownwebsite, the problem's still you .00:07:08.520 But yeah, that's what it tells you.00:07:10.360 Actually that's a nugget you wanna storein your pocket for pretty much anything00:07:13.200 in it, not just uptime kuma.Remember these things. Now again,00:07:16.600 most of the time 200 to okay iswhat you want to get. But again,00:07:19.640 just to kind of touch on the power ofthis thing, if you scroll up a bit more,00:07:22.680 you can control the http options. Youcan say I want the get post put patch,00:07:26.800 delete crud, all the stuff. Youcan do that, which is just amazing.00:07:29.960 But by default this will probablydo what you needed to do.00:07:32.440 But if you're more advanced youcan go crazy. That's all we need.00:07:35.240 I'm gonna click on save. And immediatelyit starts monitoring your stuff.00:07:39.000 Right now it already said,Hey, you're up, Chuck up Chuck.00:07:42.350 I hate when people say that. Don'tcomment it below, please don't do that.00:07:45.320 Now do you see how wonderful this is?Not only is it telling us that we're up,00:07:49.110 it's giving us response times abeautiful graph of response times.00:07:53.080 How quickly is your websiteresponding? Is it healthy?00:07:55.440 There's my expirations information.Oh dude, I love this so much, dude,00:07:59.560 why is my response timeso bad for my website?00:08:01.640 So you have your first monitorset up. What do you say?00:08:03.640 We set up another one real quickcause I wanna show you something. Now,00:08:05.920 website monitoring is cool and thefact that you can do an http monitor is00:08:09.760 awesome. But did you notice we haveanother option in the monitor? Type.00:08:12.560 Check this out. We have http withkeyword. What? What does that mean?00:08:17.170 It means something. Awesome. Let's try,what do you say we monitor network.00:08:19.880 chuck.coffee. Actually let'stake a coffee break for the url.00:08:23.000 We'll put in network chuck.coffee.And here's where the keyword comes in.00:08:26.560 Let's go out there real quick.00:08:27.320 Let's find a word or a phrasethat comes up when the page loads.00:08:29.880 Like right here it says start brewing.00:08:31.280 Let's take that case sensitiveand put it right here.00:08:33.400 What it will actually do is attempt toload the webpage and it will search for00:08:38.360 that keyword to make sure you'reactually loading the actual page.00:08:41.159 And if it loads the keyword, you'reup. If it doesn't, you're down.00:08:44.350 That's powerful. So I'll change thatto 30 seconds. Click on save and cool,00:08:48.600 we're up. Now, if I were to change itto something that's not on the site,00:08:51.360 if I were to edit, if I were to changeit to Ron Swanson and click save,00:08:55.680 it's gonna say it's down. And noticeit's telling me it's all degraded.00:08:58.400 It's scary and red. IfI go to my dashboard,00:09:00.840 which is right up here at the top right,00:09:02.240 it'll show me what's up and what's down.And notice it even does tell me that,00:09:05.880 hey, it's 200. Okay, but we couldn'tfind that keyword. So that's, ugh,00:09:09.520 that's so cool. Now what do you say?We speed around a few more monitors.00:09:12.440 Things you'll definitely want for yourhome lab or your business or whatever00:09:15.280 you're doing. Let's click on addnew monitor. Choose our type.00:09:18.100 Now I want to make sure ad guardis up. So I'm gonna do dns.00:09:21.000 I'll put in the host name. I want itto resolve, just say network http://chuck.com/.00:09:24.190 I'll put in my A guard server as theresolver 4 53. That's what I'm using.00:09:28.340 And just change some heartbeat intervals.And that's it. Click on save. Wait,00:09:32.280 why is this thing refused make look what happened? Um, oh,00:09:35.880 why did I go to port51? Did I change that?00:09:37.760 I guess I must have you done my scrollthing. All right. Okay, we're up.00:09:41.240 That scare me for a second.Live troubleshooting. Andlook how cool this is.00:09:44.520 If you jump into thatmonitor for agar here,00:09:46.120 it will show me the resultsit's receiving. That's supercool. Now ping monitor,00:09:49.520 it's pretty straightforward. It'sgoing to send an ICMP message. Hey,00:09:52.880 are you awake? And itresponds, yes I am. If it is,00:09:55.680 you can pretty much monitoranything with that one.00:09:57.760 But this one right here ispretty powerful. The TCP port,00:10:00.360 you can specify a specific TCPport to monitor. So for example,00:10:04.040 I've got a Plex server in mynetwork, I wanna see if it's up.00:10:06.600 That's my host name. And PL bydefault, beyond port 32,400,00:10:11.240 check the every 30 seconds saveand bam. I know if Plex is up now,00:10:15.440 if I were to go in there and just stopthe service, we'll see what happens.00:10:18.000 Stopping it now it is stoppedand boom, it's down. It tells me,00:10:22.320 and I love that. Now let's get it backup. Boom. Okay, we're back up. Whew.00:10:25.810 So I think you got the monitoringpart right? It'll monitor your stuff,00:10:28.200 it'll tell you when stuff isdown or up. It's beautiful.00:10:30.520 But is it actually telling you,00:10:31.640 cuz you're not gonna sit here andlook at your dashboard all day,00:10:33.960 although you could, it'sawesome. It's mesmerizing.00:10:36.220 But you wanted to tell you when you'reout and about a quick discord or Slack00:10:39.520 message, telegram. It'll do allthose things. What do you say?00:10:42.040 We set up Slack right http://now.so/ up here at the top, right,00:10:44.120 we'll go to your name kind of thingup there and click on settings.00:10:48.200 Well actually while I'm here you canchange all kinds of stuff like appearance,00:10:51.230 dark mode. You always wannabe in dark mode. You just do.00:10:53.680 You can set up a reverse proxy, notgonna cover that here, but maybe later.00:10:56.880 And then a nice added feature thathe didn't have to do but he did.00:10:59.760 Under security, you can set up twofactor what? I love that. But anyways,00:11:04.080 what we care about rightnow is notifications.00:11:05.600 Click on notifications and let's setup one click on set up notification.00:11:09.100 Let me show you all the options youhave. It's stupid. Look at this. What?00:11:12.990 Pretty much everything. Now again, whatI care about right now is not email.00:11:17.040 You can do email though. That'spretty cool. Uh, slack, I'll name it.00:11:20.200 And then here we'll need a web hook url,00:11:22.240 which is the URL that Uptime Kuma willuse to send a message to saying, Hey,00:11:26.400 your pluck servers down,we'll send it to that url.00:11:28.720 Slack will take it from there. A web hookis actually pretty similar to an api.00:11:31.960 It's just sitting there open, ready togo waiting to receive a message from you.00:11:35.280 Now for Slack to do this, you'llneed to set up an application.00:11:38.000 I'm not gonna cover the details of that,but they have a linked right down here.00:11:40.960 Click on that. Set up an app realquick. I'll start from scratch.00:11:44.200 I'm gonna add an incomingweb hook, turn it on,00:11:46.820 add a new web hook to the workspace.I'll choose the general channel for now.00:11:50.360 And then right here is that web hookurl. URL generator for me. I'll make it,00:11:53.000 make it a bit bigger to seeright here. I'm gonna copy that,00:11:55.920 paste that into my web hook url. Also, Igotta make sure I install that app. Oh,00:11:59.990 I already did. Okay, we're good. I'llput a username. Just call it uptime Kuma.00:12:03.400 You can do an icon emoji. I'll dothe fire one. Everything's on fire.00:12:06.770 Is emojipedia down. Theyneed some uptime coma.00:12:09.270 I don't need channel name because theweb hook is already setting that up for00:12:12.160 me. And that's pretty much it.00:12:14.020 I'm gonna test it real quick sincesuccessfully make I Slack. Yep,00:12:17.800 slack alert testing right there.00:12:19.200 And what's cool is I can apply this toall existing monitors and make it default00:12:22.200 enabled. Click on safe, good to go. Sonow if I were to stop plex again, ah,00:12:26.320 there it goes. Plex is down and there'smy Slack message. Bam, there it is.00:12:31.200 That's cool, right? Like that's sopowerful. How easy was that to do?00:12:34.790 I can't tell you how lucky we are rightnow in this day and age to have this00:12:38.480 setting up monitoring has never beeneasier and it was so hard back in the day.00:12:41.920 Not at the risk of making thisvideo way too long. .00:12:44.280 There is one more thing I wanna showyou cuz this thing's action Pat. Dude,00:12:47.880 come on. My video editor hates, hates memaking my videos too long. Eat it Nick.00:12:51.080 I don't care. Up here we havea thing called status pages.00:12:55.050 Oh I love this app is socool. They click on that.00:12:57.600 I can create a status page that I canmake available to anybody so people can00:13:01.760 monitor and tell me if my things are up.00:13:03.280 I can set it up as a dashboardon my TV or an iPad or something.00:13:06.520 So I click on ad new status page.I can name it, give it a url,00:13:10.120 slug and it up chuck, click on next.00:13:12.580 And then you just kind of make itlook pretty. You can add monitors,00:13:16.160 I'll add my network check website andyou can add all your stuff and click on00:13:20.000 save. And there it is a reallybeautiful, I mean it's kind of beautiful.00:13:23.130 We gotta make a dark mode. Ugh, therewe go. Now it's beautiful status page.00:13:27.320 You can go up here and say, we have anincident. Yo stuff is down. We know.00:13:31.810 So people can see stuff is down and theyknow that. You know, powerful stuff.00:13:34.960 Again, a tool I cannotbelieve is free and a tool.00:13:38.400 I can't believe you're notalready using. Are you using it?00:13:40.320 Like you should have gone throughthis and set it up with me.00:13:42.000 Have you not done thatyet? Do it right now.00:13:43.400 Thank you for spending time with me toset up some uptime. Kua is your stuff up?00:13:46.400 I don't know. Coffee. Bye. See you later."
