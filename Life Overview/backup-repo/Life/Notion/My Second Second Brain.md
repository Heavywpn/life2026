working there**0:15**both fantastic chefs**0:18**i think rob now lives in the states and**0:20**tom's stool and chelsea so this dish is**0:23**a version of that dish kind of adapted**0:26**it a bit slightly for home for you guys**0:27**to cook at home**0:29**and i'm going to cook it in the slow**0:30**cooker just a domestic slow cooker i**0:31**think that works really well as a set**0:33**and forget type of dish um bit of work**0:35**in the morning and then when you kind of**0:36**in the afternoon it's all good to go**0:39**uh if you don't have a slow cooker you**0:40**can just do this in a cupboard pot or a**0:43**dutch oven in the oven that works just**0:44**as well**0:45**or even a pressure cooker so as far as**0:48**ingredients obviously we need a lamb**0:49**shoulder this is what's called an oyster**0:50**cut lamb shoulder from the guys in**0:53**victoria at hardworks these guys produce**0:54**some excellent land**0:56**and and the oyster cut is kind of that**0:58**top shoulder blade part but if you uh**1:01**want to do a whole lamb shoulder you can**1:02**definitely do that and adapt the recipe**1:04**just by doubling the other ingredients**1:06**or not even doubling um maybe another**1:08**half of the other ingredients um but you**1:10**just want lamb shoulder you want that**1:11**into muscular tissue and fat which you**1:14**know works really well on these slow**1:16**braises so then we just got some basic**1:18**chicken stock um if you're buying the**1:20**box type of chicken stock from**1:21**supermarket make sure you're getting a**1:22**low sodium one otherwise when you reduce**1:25**your sauce at the end it does become**1:27**often become a bit too salty**1:29**and basic naropa carrots and onions uh**1:31**some garlic thyme that's new vinegar**1:33**obviously and then we're gonna do some**1:35**of the shallots differently we'll cook**1:36**them separately so that we can really**1:38**control how well they're cooked and they**1:39**don't go kind of mushy um these shallots**1:41**when they're cooked like this**1:43**are delicious they're super tasty if you**1:45**can't find these shallots which i've**1:47**referred to as banana shallots i'm not**1:48**sure**1:49**maybe they're good french lots as well**1:52**if you can't find these just use baby**1:53**onions**1:54**let's get started**1:56**so first thing we need to do is get the**1:58**lamb shoulder ready and sealed off**1:59**before we put it in our slow cooker so**2:02**take your lamb out of your packet dry it**2:03**off and then give it a good season with**2:05**salt but no pepper at this point i find**2:07**that the pepper burns a bit too much**2:09**when you're trying to seal it off**2:10**in a heavy base fry pan with a decent**2:13**amount of oil in it put your lamb**2:15**shoulder in with the fat side down now**2:17**you're going to seal this off for about**2:18**10 to 15 minutes so you get good golden**2:20**color and while that's happening you can**2:22**get your mirror path sorted so cut your**2:23**onion in quarters and peel it slice your**2:26**carrot on an angle just take the tops**2:28**off no need to peel it either**2:30**cut a head of garlic in half and get**2:32**your thyme ready now you can see we're**2:34**starting to develop some good color on**2:35**this lamb but we really want to**2:37**emphasize how important it is to get as**2:39**much calories you can on this before you**2:41**start doing your veggies it's also**2:43**important to seal the slam on all sides**2:46**just to lock all that flavor in before**2:48**you start slow cooking it so once that's**2:50**sealed take it out and set it to the**2:52**side and then you can start getting some**2:54**color on your mirror file now don't be**2:56**as reckless as i am and be careful when**2:57**you've got hot oil in a pan just**2:59**chucking your carrots in but get some**3:01**good color on all sides on all your**3:03**carrots and onions**3:05**before you add your calf garlic clove**3:07**with the flesh side down**3:09**and your time as well just to start**3:11**getting those oils out of it you can**3:13**notice there i've also tied the time**3:15**together that just stops it from falling**3:16**apart making it easier to pull out**3:19**in goes your balsamic vinegar just to**3:20**deglaze the pan and then that goes in**3:22**the bottom of your slow cooker with your**3:24**lamb on top so now it's time to add the**3:26**chicken stock and on the recipe i've**3:28**called for a liter of chicken stock but**3:30**just use your initiative as to how much**3:31**you use because you don't want to**3:33**completely cover the lamb you still want**3:35**that delicious gold in the outside part**3:37**protruding the stock level**3:40**once you've got your stock in there and**3:42**goes the lid and into your slow cooker**3:44**on low for seven hours**3:46**and if you're doing this in an oven then**3:48**set your oven temperature to 80 degrees**3:50**celsius**3:51**all right so it's about seven hours**3:52**later and it's time to get our shallots**3:54**ready now you see i've peeled these but**3:55**i've left the core intact and that's**3:57**super important so it doesn't fall apart**3:59**when you cook it later so once you've**4:01**peeled them just slice them in half and**4:03**with that core intact it will stay**4:05**together once you cook them**4:07**onto a tray and then just give them a**4:08**good seasoning with salt and then over**4:11**to a pan on medium heat that you can**4:13**ideally put this pan in the oven**4:14**otherwise you have to take them out and**4:16**put them on a tray you can put them in**4:17**the oven so with a light drizzle of**4:19**olive oil put the shallots skin side**4:21**down and after about two or three**4:23**minutes you can add your dollop of**4:25**butter**4:26**once your butter is all nice and browned**4:28**you can add your sprigs of thyme and**4:29**then check to make sure that you've got**4:31**nice color on the slots for adding your**4:33**balsamic vinegar**4:35**into 180 degree oven for 15 to 20**4:39**minutes or until they're just cooked you**4:41**know nice you can put a knife through**4:43**them**4:44**but they're still holding together**4:46**all right time to deal to this lamb**4:48**shoulder so pull your slow cooker out**4:50**and get a tray ready for your lamb**4:53**shoulder and you're going to remove the**4:55**slam shoulder from the source uh nice**4:57**and carefully just making sure it**4:59**doesn't fall apart on you now it**5:00**shouldn't fall apart after seven hours**5:02**it should stay together um but it will**5:04**be tender so you know take your time and**5:06**be delicate with it so in a clean**5:08**saucepan through a fine mesh sieve**5:10**you're just going to pass your braising**5:12**liquid off and this is what's going to**5:14**make the sauce so it's super flavorful**5:17**but you just want to pass it and then**5:19**give it a skimmed make sure there's none**5:21**of that lamb fat kind of on the top you**5:22**don't want that lamp fat emulsifying**5:24**into your sauce and friendly reminder to**5:26**keep your bench clean while you're**5:27**cooking**5:29**um so once that's come to the boil**5:31**give it a taste make sure the**5:33**seasoning's not too crazy just yet and**5:35**keep reducing this down until you've got**5:37**the flavor or the seasoning kind of**5:39**right where you want it and i'll be**5:41**tasting it every five to six minutes**5:42**just to make sure**5:44**i did this for about 25 minutes until i**5:46**was happy with it**5:48**all right so your shallots should be**5:49**ready now just pull those out and put**5:51**them on the same tray as the lamb we're**5:52**going to flash that to to reheat it when**5:54**we're ready with the sauce**5:57**this also stays in good but**5:59**i am going to cheat a bit and we're**6:01**going to thicken it with a bit of**6:02**cornstarch because after all this is**6:04**effectively a home cooking channel**6:06**rather than a professional cooking**6:07**channel in the real world in the**6:08**restaurant world we were never allowed**6:10**to thicken our sauces with corn flour or**6:12**roos or anything like that**6:14**these like very traditional kind of**6:16**style sauces um but you know hey we're**6:18**at home we can do what we want the only**6:20**other thing i'd say is it's a bit um too**6:22**forward on the carrot so i think i just**6:24**overdid it with the carrot i think i put**6:26**two in there uh in the recipe i'll put**6:28**one on i think it's gonna be just a**6:29**little bit less carrot but other than**6:31**that it's a it's a pretty tasty little**6:32**sauce**6:36**so to thicken our sauce with cornflour**6:37**we're going to make it what we call a**6:38**slurry so take your cornflour and then**6:40**just dissolve it in some cold water**6:42**before you pour into your sauce if you**6:45**pour the the cornflour directly into the**6:47**sauce it's just gonna go all lumpy**6:49**so it's also important to whisk your**6:51**slurry in while there's heat under the**6:53**sauce**6:54**um so now we're ready to plate so you're**6:56**gonna reheat your lamb shoulder and**6:58**shallots and i've just done some mash**7:00**here to have with it and i think this is**7:02**the perfect dish to serve family style**7:04**like we are here so take your lamb**7:07**shoulder from the oven and carefully**7:09**move it to your serving dish**7:11**and then now that you have your lamb**7:13**shoulder successfully in your plating**7:15**dish it's time to pour some of that**7:18**sauce all over it and don't be shy with**7:20**that sauce pretty good stuff**7:22**so**7:23**the final main garnish some your roasted**7:25**shallots all over it**7:28**and then we're just going to finish it**7:29**with a few picked thyme leaves um as a**7:32**little bit of extra garnish and yes i**7:33**did cut myself but i'm okay**7:36**we have a balsamic and thyme braised**7:38**lamb shoulder**7:45**time to eat**7:56**oh just literally tears away**8:11**so delicious the lamb's**8:13**like perfectly tender you know it's not**8:15**like it doesn't dissolve in your mouth**8:17**it's delicious**8:21**with that creamy mash and the balsamic**8:23**it just works really well with lamb**8:26**you know that kind of sweet acidity just**8:28**works really well with the sweet meat of**8:30**lamb**8:32**no wonder we should sell so many
