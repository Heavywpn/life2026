introductions along the way and I remember you came to me and I don't know how long ago it was would it be fair to say 6 years or 5 years ago I think it  
was about four and a half years four and a half years ago okay so four and a half years ago I met you and you said to me  
I've got this idea for a TV show and I think I was in the stages of coming up  
with my ideas for my TV show at the time that I was making and so there was there  
was genuinely at my at that at that point there was me saying to myself oh okay he's getting into the same world as  
I am but in a completely different genre but he's a real estate broker  
absolutely and how the hell is he going to pull this off so for the benefit of everyone right now let's let's talk a  
little bit about how a real estate broker becomes the star of a TV show  
that's shown all over the world yes absolutely I mean thank you for having me on your show it's it's a great honor  
and a privilege as well I don't know how I got on here actually but uh I I did something right do you know what cuz you  
have a story that I believe everybody needs to hear and I don't believe you tell it enough and hopefully today at  
the end of this episode people going to go I like this guy I want to be like this guy I promise I will share that  
story with you ab and and to be honest with you you weren't the only one a lot of people were were you know doubting me  
a lot of people were like how's this guy going to pull this off even I didn't know how I was going to pull it off it  
was just an idea I was working I started my career in 2002 as a real estate  
broker you could say up until 2009 I was one of the top Brokers I was known very  
much in the industry um I was young made a lot of money very arrogant and um my  
whole world just crashed and came to an end when 2008 2009 when the subprime  
happened it was the first recession that I ever experienced and so you could say I lost pretty much half  
of my wealth I was extremely lucky that I invested in ready property and I had  
some passive income but in 2009 2010 a lot of people a lot of my friends had  
left the country um you know the cars were left at the airports I decided to  
stay because the lifestyle was much better here in Dubai than in Vancouver Canada where I'm from I had a nanny and  
a maid which I was paying like 2,000 Dirhams you can't get that in Canada right yeah and so I'm like okay let me  
stay in Dubai and I'll apply for a job a salary job and maybe I'll I'll change my  
career as well and so about for a year and a half was depressed um I didn't know what I was  
going to do I only knew how to sell real estate and so 200 I think it was about  
12 13 The Mark Market started picking up and I realized that a lot of the people  
that started their companies during the recession I mean they're competitors  
today I mean but look at like for example fos from fam right Al alsup and  
ALS unique properties like these are Big names today right they're the leaders in  
the market they all started in 2009 so I saw these guys start their  
companies set up and pretty much build Empires mhm and so I'm like you know  
what I did it wrong and I jumped back into the market as a broker I had to swallow my pride  
because obviously I had to join a company and uh I had to start from the  
bottom and just basically build my career and and and work my way up the ladder I saw these guys enter into the  
market they built their companies and I pretty much got left behind so I thought to myself how can I  
catapult my career right I saw fos for example on Instagram he really inspired  
me and I saw his following increase and I saw a lot of people basically go on social media and I'm like it's too late  
for social media and everyone was telling me as well Ben don't do Tik Tok don't do Instagram every single real  
estate broker is popping up and it's so annoying so I I actually listen to this  
advice and I'm like okay so what can I do maybe you know and I was watching million dollar listing for years and I'm  
like why is the show not here we've got some of the best properties in the world we've got the world's largest Towers  
we've got these man-made islands and I'm like you know what maybe we should do a  
Million Dollar Listing Dubai or a Million Dollar Listing UA so it was just an idea and  
um I went after it um I contacted the producers in the  
US and then I came to know that it was a NBC Universal production and then I contacted them and um I told them I had  
an idea didn't have the finance or the cash but uh I might be able to bring  
someone to the table who who I can partner with and so  
um it was about four or five years of trying um sleepless nights I  
pretty much put my business on on hold um I almost went  
bankrupt so so so tell me what happened as you went as you went on this journey it's quite interesting for me so you get  
this idea you speak to the the the the TV H company in the United States they're like yeah uh if you want to do  
it we'll let you do it yeah they gave you the permission to do it as long as you could raise the finance and produce it so it wasn't that easy actually they  
wanted they wanted a background check they wanted a kyc they're like who are you um and so I put together pretty much  
um I put my my parents' portfolio together which they have they're Real Estate Investors and they've got some  
properties back in Canada so I use their name and obviously um I'm self-made  
myself I came here in in 2002 um basically get away from from my family  
and just to set up my own yeah do your own thing and do my own thing yeah exactly but I'm like you know what NBC  
Universal is never going to entertain this kid who basically has this idea so I put together this this really um  
enticing package with like this property portfolio I've got and my including my properties is here in Dubai as well and  
um my achievements as well in the real estate and uh pretty much look it was a it was a I sold it to them over the  
phone pitch yeah I pitched I dropped some names as well I said I know this person I know that person and I can get  
it done and and you know they got excited about it as well and they're like it sounds good but uh you know they  
had their reservations so they're like you need to acquire the rights and the format and  
you have to basically pay a certain amount every six months to renew the rights so initially I had paid the first  
you know I paid the first fees and then the six months had passed and I paid another fees and I was just like my my  
bank account was coming was just going down I wasn't really working real estate because I was running around the city  
trying to pitch the idea so I was meeting a lot of the big names and the big families you know the the garges the  
gurer um I even basically sent a message out to his Excellency Muhammad alabar um  
a lot of them entertained me they thought it was a great idea they're like meet my CEO um meet my marketing  
department so I sat up across the table um with some of these big names as well  
and I pitched the idea and they loved it as well they're like Okay sounds interesting but then when it came down  
to execution and finances uh you know I just kept hitting brick wall after brick  
wall it was like it was just rejection after Rejection it was really frustrating because I was literally I  
was betting on this and uh and I was just getting rejected no one was taking me seriously  
but did it did it get you down did it get you from you know frustra obviously but you're in sales so you know the rejections part of the game of course  
did did you start to lose faith in it but it was opportunity cost because I was like putting all my time and energy  
into this project which I really believed in and I'm like you know this is going to basically give me the  
exposure and since 2002 I was always promoting Dubai I mean when there was  
not even one ready Freehold property I was like I met a client literally from 22 years back he actually he he  
contacted me uh from the show and he came to my office and he's like Ben you're the first person you're the  
only person that threw me in your car you came on to the Palm Island when it was all dirt and there was nothing there  
and it was just like trailers and trucks he's like two people had a vision in the city one was Sheikh Muhammad and the  
second was Ben bandari so I was like so you know I was always promoting Dubai um  
and I'm like you know people need to see this this country not I mean Dubai Abu  
Dhabi I was going back every year to Vancouver I was going to Canada from since 2002 and people were people are  
like Ben where were you I'd go to the gym and they're like you haven't been around we haven't seen you and I'm like I live in Dubai like where's that and  
then year after year they're like oh my God isn't that where they have those man-made Islands isn't that where they're they're they're building Borge  
Dubai it was Borge Dubai back then right yeah and so people were becoming more and more familiar with with the city so  
I was always promoting Dubai I even by even some of my family they're like Ben  
is any of this stuff ever going to get even built yeah or this is this is all a scam yeah and I was like no there's no  
way right and so yes um there were obviously but but  
but but when you're on this journey of trying to trying to get this this TV show off the ground you're speaking to all the developers you're speaking to  
brokers brokerages who are you speaking right so um I I was trying every every  
single angle anyone who would listen anyone who would listen and anyone that I thought would be able to finance and  
basically would be able would would would believe in in my vision and would partner with me as well right so some of  
the top Brokers as well some of the top firms some of the names I've already mentioned right they all they're like  
yeah this is amazing it's great but when is it ever going to happen or is it going to happen and I remember uh I was  
literally like on my last dime and I had passive income I had rental income but  
the lifestyle in Dubai you know things are not cheap it's not cheap right and so I'm like maybe it's time to work and  
start doing what I do best which is real estate so I I I joined one of the the larger real estate  
companies and I sat across the CEO and it was like a three-year-old company and they were doing extremely well and he  
looked at my CV and he said wow you should be running my company and he said the deals that you have done and the  
contacts that you have right if you do well then I would consider making you an equity partner  
and I said that's amazing right and then I told him about my idea about million  
dooll listing and how it's a game Cher right it's going to disrupt the market and it's this and it's that and he's  
looked at me and he said he said this is never going to happen he's like get it out of your  
mind and I said what and he said focus on real estate focus on selling cuz you  
you're just going to fail and because of the experience that I had and  
obviously four years of of rejection and  
failure it actually it struck a court and I'm like you know what maybe he's right so I mothballed the project and  
the million dooll listing I just put it on hold and I'm like and NBC Universal was getting really frustrated as well  
cuz they're like What's going on right yeah and I I didn't have the rights but I was still in communication  
I said look this is going to happen I'm going to get it off the ground I was the only one they were talking to there was no one else  
obviously and so I worked for about a year and things weren't working well I mean a  
lot of my deals were not happening you know clients were just  
disappearing not answering my call and being frustrated  
and coming to know that my deals were basically being pulled from underneath  
my my feet the carpet the rug was just being pulled from underneath my feet and getting confirmation from the operations  
director after I left that look your deals were being stolen and so I'm just  
like you know what maybe this guy didn't have my best interest maybe what he told me was not  
true and I said to hell with everyone that basically didn't believe in me and  
said you're going to fail and it's not going to happen mhm you know I'm going to pursue this and I'm going to make this happen and so you got this renewed  
kind of like fire in your belly I got this fire in my belly and I'm just like you know what I'm going to show everyone right I'm I'm like I'm I'm just  
going to I'm going to show all the hit you got be see I want to know what what happen next and so I'll I'll never  
forget I was in bed one night and I was so determined and I'm like you know what  
in Dubai rejection after rejection let's look at Abu Dhabi right like maybe they'll be interested but I'm like  
million doll thing Abu Dhabi Dubai you know like it's you know everyone wants to see Dubai I mean it's the  
reality right yeah nobody knew that Abu Dhabi is up and coming they've got big  
plans right and Abu Dhabi was always kind of in the shadows of was in the  
shadows of duai now Abu Dhabi is I believe is on another level  
right so I'm like let's look at Abu Dhabi so I went on Google and I googled  
production companies in Abu Dhabi uhuh right  
and there's two companies that that came up right the first one was image  
nation and the second one was an mrti lady who was who had her own production company  
and imation looked really looked too big for me and it looked like it was I I could I saw it was semi government and  
they were they had done a lot of um like uh Hollywood Productions like Men In  
Black like snitch with Dwayne The Rock Johnson like um big Stu Flight with  
Denzel Washington so I'm just like wow these guys are like the real deal right  
so I didn't even know how to approach them or how to start and so I I ch to call the the  
second one which was the emarati lady and she was on her she was in the hospital bed and she was about to give  
birth and she's like but she entertained me cuz I told her I had this idea and she's like oh wow Million Dollar Listing  
and she thought she had a client who and she thought that I was going to finance it the second she she came to know that  
I didn't have any money and that it was just an idea I I said I could I could feel I  
could sense the the tone in her voice and everything just changed she's like she stopped answering my calls and she  
stopped entertaining me and answering my messages so but during that conversation I had with her I said look what about  
imagination maybe they can Finance it and maybe they would be interested and she said no they would NE she they would never be interested in in a documentry  
or reality television like this they've never done anything like it so it discouraged me but then I'm like you  
know let's let's just reach out to them so I looked at the the profile the chairman his Excellency he was the  
chairman of alar as well and the chairman of culture and tourism in Abu Dhabi I'm like so he's into property  
he's into production culture and tourism I'm like maybe I can kill three birds with one stone MH right  
so and then I did some background and some research on on his excellenc and I  
was like I was blown away I'm like okay this gentleman is not just a normal  
individual but I I  
uh I I got the courage to basically contact him it was a cold call and I  
pretty much give him the elevator pitch uh I called him first and he didn't answer and I'm like okay of  
course someone like him is not going to answer his phone and I was I'll never forget I was drawing down safu Road and  
I got this this number and uh I saw it was a was a v VIP  
number and uh with the fives and all the yeah yeah it was not a normal number and  
so I was like oh my God so I I took a deep breath and um and I answered and I said uh hello is this your excellence  
and he's like yes I had a Mis call from this number right total American accent and you could tell he was educated  
Western educated and I said your Excellency you don't know who I am I'm a real estate broker but I've got this  
great idea it's a real estate reality television show it's a two-time Emy  
nominated show it's in 140 plus countries and it's perfect to Showcase  
aldar developments and also to showcase the culture and tourism in Abu Dhabi and he's like okay I'm interested tell me  
more right so I started telling him about the show and he got really engaged and he started throwing ideas at me he's  
like you know we could contact all the landlords we could get the properties and we can do he's like can we show the  
Lou in Abu Dhabi I'm like of course you can you can do whatever you want right  
and so he got excited I got excited that he got excited yeah right and so he's like okay Ben he's like uh tell me  
exactly what you need and I said I need everything right I'm like look I'm just  
a kid with an idea it's a great idea but I need production I need Finance I need  
I don't know anything when it comes to this business so he started laughing and he's like okay let me get someone to  
call you and so I got like I was like over the moon I'll never forget that  
feeling I've got that feeling right right now I've just got like chills and just running through my body and so this  
was that the most that was was that the most optimism and and positivity you'd had up until that  
point was that like you you started to feel help yes and no because it was the first call I made to abudabi and I knew  
that basically had this huge production company and he was also into development  
right so everything was there right but at the same time I had my  
doubts because everyone I had talked to in Dubai was also interested and they  
loved the idea but then when it came to basically execution it was just  
everything was rejected so I'm like you know what we've got one foot in now but  
obviously it's not nothing is going to happen unless basically it's confirmed  
and we sign off on it right so I had my I had my  
doubts okay happen so then she's like when can you come so I get this phone call from this  
lady in Australian accent and uh we hit it off and she asked me for some some  
information when it came to produ and I I didn't know what I was talking about I'm like can I come back to you on that  
and I took notes and then I Googled it and then I I I sent her an Emil I'm like can you send me an email everything that  
you're asking for right so I could do my research and then and she wanted a deck which I had but it wasn't very  
professional right and so um I sent her an email and she's like this is not exactly what I'm looking for but when  
can you come to Abu Dhabi I'm like I can come right away let me know when's best for you so she's like come on come uh in  
a couple days we we arranged so I went down there and it was in 2454 which was  
part it's like the media city of Abu Dhabi I know yeah and there was like literally five people it was like a board and I wasn't expecting I I thought  
I was meeting this lady but I met um all these these five lovely people and they  
were all all either they were all expats one from Australia from the US and every  
single person knew the show had watched the show and they loved it and they asked me over and over why  
has this not been done why has Dubai not pick this up and I didn't have an answer for them  
I said I don't know you tell me and so they're like well their loss is our gain and they they're like this  
is an amazing idea um we were very interested and  
we'll come back to you so I went back to Dubai and I was super excited I got another phone call from from the lady  
and she's like I want to set up the second meeting uh with a with a with a gentleman his name is is Ben Ross at  
that time he was the chief content officer of image nation and there was another gentleman as well um uh his name  
was Steve Norris he worked for 250 2454 and um I met uh Ben and uh it was  
it was just the the two of them and they asked the same questions again how come this hasn't been done and uh they said  
Ben um we love the idea and we want to move forward and we're going to continue  
we've actually reached out to MBC Universal right we know that you don't  
have the the formatting rights because I never I I went in there as if I pretty  
much owned million dollar list yeah right they're like obviously we work with NBC Universal over the last um  
decades and um we're going to move forward um and so I was like at that  
point I'm thinking you know what they're going to tell me thank you so much but uh we'll take it over from here and we  
don't need you anymore thanks for the idea it's always in the back of your mind right that someone's going to  
bypass you and I didn't have the rights yeah because I didn't continue cuz I didn't have the I didn't have the money  
yeah right so he turns to me and I'm sweating and I'm like okay that's great and he's like we're going to do this  
um and if you're not a part of it we're we're not going to do it so I was like like all of that just  
nervousness and just like fear and anxiety fear and anxiety just like it  
just it was just like all flushed out and I was like over the moon and I'm like oh my God thank you so much I  
really appreciate it and they're like we appreciate your you introducing this and all the hard work and effort that You'  
put into this and um and the rejection over the years um but you're our partner  
on this that's always like wow it was like a dream right and then he's like from here  
on moving forward it's like it's it's lawyers it's like it's like um Harvard  
against Stanford lawyers so you won't understand it and it's complicated it's not very exciting so just sit back we'll  
CC you on all the emails and we'll we'll walk you through it um just sit back and enjoy the ride and so I was like thank  
you so much and then I went back to Dubai and I was just like over the moon I was just like  
wow I'm like this is actually going happen out well Jennifer who's also an  
executive producer um on the show she she was with me in that meeting so we  
were both over the moon it was just something she actually introduced the show to me uh about a decade ago um how m is that  
it was crazy how long did once they said right we're going to go through this stuff of the lawyers what how long was it then for before production started so  
we actually that was um I'll never forget it was  
2019 December and so when did when the production and 2020 we hit Co oh of  
course and there was a chance that that would never happen and the CEO calls me up and he's  
like uh we're going to have to rethink this right so it was like a roller  
coaster and we were just engaged with the with the legal team and we had  
acquired the rights and we're like is this ever going to happen but then to our surprise and I  
think the world's surprised that's when like content was King right all of a  
sudden like Netflix Stars play Roku like all the shares went up because everyone was at home watching TV right and the  
streaming services right so it was a good thing actually it helped us um but  
there was that time where we thought or I thought that oh my God this m here it  
is again here we go again we got it off the ground but it's just going to like it's you know crash and burned what what  
were moments that you can remember that were kind of like highlights to was it like the first day of filming or was it  
the first planning meeting or was it asking other people that you know to be involved what was what what were the  
highlights for you so I actually um the highlights were working with the the  
team at Imagination so I became really good friends with them um great people I  
mean very dear people to me um and um I came I I obviously um because real  
estate is my background so there was all there was the casting call as well so we brought in um Joel from Lebanon she had  
done like I think the voice and some of these uh really big reality shows as  
well within the region so she came here and it was different because real estate is is different than singing and um they  
pretty much really depended on on my knowhow when casting and and what to  
look for when basically looking for the right people to be to be on a real estate reality  
show right so who's in the show so okay we have uh we have Riyad gohar uhuh  
which um coincidentally we've been friends for 15 years I didn't think he was going to make the show to be honest  
with you and but but he did um and then we have uh we have Ramy  
wahood um he's a big personality um he's Syrian American from Chicago so that's  
quite a funny story as well because um he the first video that he ever did I think FZ posted on his Instagram and um  
I saw it and I really liked it so I reached out to him and I said what do you think about being on a real estate reality  
show and then um he's like yeah let's meet up and then he was not even  
interested and I told him about the show and he started watching and then he started basically  
contacting me and he's like let's meet up for lunch and he's like this is amazing I love it I can't can't  
wait and he was actually cut from the show and then uh he was he was brought  
back and he he he obviously he made the cut but then we have also Z Brown um  
she's she's from the UK MH but I think she's got uh Indian background Heritage  
and we have Nas Sakai who's uh who's Moroccan as well so we've got a nice  
diverse cast for season one and so the the casting go that must have been fun  
though were they just conversations or did people have to do anything so um yeah just imagine how much I went  
through uh Spencer so when I actually sat with imag nation the um one of the  
producers of the head of production came to me and said Ben great job for bringing the show it's amazing but uh we  
have to tell you one thing and I said what's that yes you will be executive producer and um however uh there's no  
guarantee that uh you're going to be a cast member and so I'm like what I said well  
the main reason for obviously going after this show is to be on the  
show and he said well there's no guarantees he said it's actually up to  
the broadcaster so you're going to have to audition like everyone else and uh if you make the cut you make  
it but if they don't like you then there's what can we do and so I was so what's an audition Li  
how does an audition go tell me so uh there's actually quite a few steps and  
processes so and I was completely they're like um executive you're going  
to have to take your executive producer hat off and now put your your um cast your cast member hat on so they were  
like not telling me a lot of things and they're like okay now the first um  
interview is going to be over a zoom because we just had CO as well MH right so people were reluctant and skeptical  
to to me so it was an interview tell us about yourself right how long have you been in  
the real estate industry what have you sold what was your biggest sale why should you be on Million Dollar Listing  
why are you perfect fit for this show and so we had I think over at that time  
um now there's 20,000 plus brokers in the market but that time it was there were a lot less MH I think even less  
than half of that there was like 7,000 8,000 plus and uh we had 3,000 plus  
people audition right 3,000  
3,000 yes no way yeah and a lot of people we also rejected because um  
course we had 3,000 and no we there it was actually more than 3,000 3,000 interviewed people I think we had about  
5,000 half of the market actually applied but a lot of the people we didn't entertained because they were off  
plan Specialists like they worked for companies where you would just sell off paper  
right under construction developments right so to be on Million Dollar Listing  
you need to have list expensive properties yeah not only list expensive properties but you need to um you need  
to know how to sell secondary properties like ready properties like walk people through the property and sell a a  
tangible product right off plan uh property properties are very easy you take your client take them to the  
developer office and they sell off paper right so you have to have the skill and the art of selling a property  
negotiation skills right dealing with sellers going to  
listing appointments right dealing with Buyers negotiating between the the buyers and the  
sellers so you need to have some sort of a a sales skill so 3,000 more than 3,000  
people comes down to a group of five of you yeah yeah so we went from 3,000 to I  
think it was about 100 and then we went from 100 to about 32 and then 32 there was 15 and then there  
was a top eight and then we went from eight to five is there anybody that didn't make the cup that you wish  
did I you're trying to get me in trouble right no all who do you who do you wish did uh so  
um so at that time is I'm going to put myself out there um so  
I so the executive producer Jennifer um she she's an Arabic speaker she's also  
um I'm in a relationship with her right now but at that time I was going through um a separation and a divorce so uh they  
thought that she would be a good fit for the show but I didn't want to showcase  
her because I didn't want people to know that obviously we were in a relationship sure cuz I didn't want the controversy  
that's somebody you didn't want who do you think but she should have been on she should she should have been yeah  
she's so I kind of I'm reversing it and did she forgive you for that um she's honestly  
she she didn't really want to how can  
I she said look whatever is best for your career she she's very supportive and that's what I love about her so  
she's like I don't believe you she said that on the ser I swear to you she's like look it's not important whether I'm  
on the show or not um what's important is that you're on the show and she supported me um but um look there's  
always season two yeah right there could always be more so you film a season how  
many episodes so uh season one was Nine episodes nine episodes how long did it  
take to film those Nine episodes so it was about so  
so in Dubai and UAE we did that in about four and a half five months okay in the  
US so it was like really congested right cuz things are done differently in the US they they do it pretty much all year  
and they film twice a week MH in the US or once I think once or twice a week the Alman brothers were telling me here we  
do pretty much it's 24 hours it's uh 5 days a week so you're we're pretty much  
you wake up the cameras are there you go to bed the cameras are there So you  
you're doing this film and you produce this show it then goes out right and all  
of a sudden Ben bandari is now in the public eye yeah you're now  
famous you could say that sounds weird when I say that out loud to you yeah it does but the truth is it's a bit cringey  
but [Laughter] yeah well at the end of the  
day you and I are both salese so the truth is what what do we need to be uccessful in sales attention absolutely  
you know Ryan suran says the best to be on the Mountaintop basically yelling and  
letting everyone know you're there absolutely gr Cardone says exactly the same thing it's all about attention and  
I'm I'm trying to get Gary vay I'm trading attention so you're now getting eyeballs on you  
yes what did that do for you positively and  
negatively so I can't think of anything negatively to be honest because it's it's been great um so what did it do  
positively for you they talk about how it impacted your personal life if anything or how it impacted business  
what changed from that point of view so for business it's been amazing um so I  
I'm recognized Now everywhere I pretty much in the real estate world right when I go to developers offices or I  
basically like yesterday I had a uh podcast with AJ a mutual friend of ours  
right and I came down the elevator and then uh I I walked to my car and then I  
saw these two ladies like you know whispering and giggling and you know smiling and then uh sat in my car and  
then they they they literally followed me to my car and I rolled down my window and they're like hello hi Ben how are  
you we've seen you on TV and I'm like oh wow great uh did you did you enjoy the  
show and they're like yeah it's amazing and then I saw oh you work for ax Capital cuz I recognized the badge act  
right and then they're like yes and I'm like how's that going for you and they're like it's it's good we're only  
here for a month and I'm like great good luck right and so it was nice to be recognized and just forc someone to come  
and say hello and then I went home and then later that night um the same lady messaged me on Instagram and said very  
nice to meet you um I'd love to basically have uh you know meet again  
and talk a little more we I didn't want to disturb you as you were leaving right so I said Thank you so so much uh feel  
free to come to my office so it's made you a hit with the ladies uh well you  
are trying to get me in trouble right a a cap very attractive ladies I  
from I used to train ex X Cav yeah anyway so so it's been get  
attention I'm getting a lot of attention from people that are that are are looking to buy real estate do you think  
that you get more opportunity because of the TV show not So Much from the buyer side um so what what I can tell you is  
my team are using my name and leveraging my name more than I am yeah I've got this one Superstar who's who actually  
her name is Sara she joined me and she left x capital she's been with me for three  
months and she sold over 200 million wow right but she's been able to leverage my name in The Million Dollar Listing brand  
and then well let's add on to that for a minute here because not only that but um um Arabian business  
has uh uh placed you as the number one real estate broker here in the UAE is  
that correct yes yes so tell me about that yeah I mean that was for goodness amazing I mean um yeah I wasn't  
expecting that I knew I was on the list but to be number one I mean it's just such an honor especially from Arabian  
business what does that what does what does that mean for you as a professional though what does it mean do obviously  
you can trade on the back of that I'm I'm I'm vote is it voting or is it they identify who the top person so I think  
there's uh there's certain criterias right okay it's um the impact that you've had in in the real estate  
industry years of experience number of deals value of deals there's a lot of things lot of successful guys on that  
list there's a lot of big names yeah yes lot of big names I said did you get lots of um positive encouragement from that  
or would you get a few bitter jealous people that Happ a bit of both yeah yeah  
so there's been there's been group chats where like a lot of salty people in the industry well anyone that doesn't win  
wants to find a reason why you won and they don't they don't always you know graciously and then they make their own  
titles as well yeah that happens too yeah and then they start posting it and then they get their entire company to  
make videos for them saying how great they are but I mean it's it's just it's  
expected in this industry right so from a a guy from Canada that comes over here to start a business in 2000 sorry work  
in the industry in 2002 to learning and doing well and in 2009 when the whole  
Market collapses sitting thinking holy macaroni what am I going to do with my life you then have gone from that pain  
and that hurt to struggling to make it happen in 2013 and one the market starts  
to pick up a bit but then a few years after that this idea gets into your head and it's like hold on a minute here okay  
I'd like to do this and you sacrificed a lot of time doing your job the time be making money because real estate brokers  
you know they they eat what they kill yes to try and get this ID off the ground and at every opportunity that  
door was closed and then it was closed and it was closed and it was closed but you kept going yes and that one chance  
situation that happened okay with Abu Dhabi and for people that don't live in  
here in the region don't know Abu Dhabi we're here we got seven Emirates as you and I both know those seven Emirates Abu  
Dhabi is by far the largest of those Emirates and it's where the they they say the majority of the wealth is um and  
obviously capital of the U and it's the capital of the country and so you've gone down there not being from Abu Dhabi  
not working in Abu Dhabi not selling in ababi and you've taken a chance and on the back of that after four and a half  
years of struggle you got this little win that  
became a bigger and bigger and bigger win yes and now arguably Ben as I've known you all  
these years you're recognized as the number one broker in this city or in this country  
you're recognized as the star of million dooll listing and you're a humble guy yes I  
Tred to stay humble um I mean not that young I may look young I'm 48 48 1976  
I'm 54 I'm older than you4 we're still young at heart right definitely I still think I'm 30 in my  
head yeah I A A bit more though but what I can tell you is so you know we have we  
have to learn from our mistakes back when the market was booming when I was 24 25 years old I was making a lot of  
money so you know it was Unreal from 2002 to 2008 I was invoicing like  
350,000 500,000 I was young I was Dumb and I was  
arrogant right I was very cocky I was known as the king in my  
company at that time I was working for the largest real estate company back yeah better homes so you're better homes  
from 2000 yeah 20 what's the Irish guy what's Ryan M Ryan he Canadian Irish  
Irish December Canadian okay so I started my Brokerage in 2003 up until  
2006 and I made a lot of money lots of people did and I was 25 26  
27 can you imagine yeah so I was cocky and arrogant and that's all I knew to be  
you know I didn't it was like it was NOA reach yeah  
right it's exactly what it is yeah exactly what it is yeah so and then I saw you know you think you're a baller  
yeah I thought I was a baller think you're baller EXA I was buying property I was buying cars and uh you know people  
respected me in my face but then behind my back they were like oh this guy's an  
mhm right I remember I mean I came here in January  
2005 yeah and so was crazy it it I'm 19 years here you I came here  
and there's this this this madness going on and you know nobody could rent people had to pay their rent annually and so  
nobody could afford it and so everyone was busy sharing properties and you know real estate brokers were selling with  
10% down and 90% to be paid upon completion and the banks were financing flipping and flipping and flipping and  
flipping and so all of that kind of stuff going on I remember doing the deal with Barkley's Bank when we provided all  
of the life insurance for their mortgages so when Barkley's first launch Mortgage Services here they only  
launched them for 12 years and I'm like why are we doing 12E mortgages they're like we're not sure the buildings will last longer than 12 years yeah that's  
what they said to me at the beginning of the journey and and so all this kind of stuff from all these years ago that  
we've been here is involved in this city has now become everything everybody  
doubted it became the opposite yes cuz everybody the naysay has completely say  
oh it's going to fall apart it's going to go wrong especially with 2008 this isn't going to be a place people aren't going to want to here and here we are  
now in 2024 we're bigger and yeah we center of the earth yes  
arguably where are all the rich people in London wanted to move to Dubai Dubai where is anybody with with a family that  
wants to live in a safe environment considering going to do I and so from a business point of view from a wealth  
protection point of view from a family security point of view from a tax  
perspective geographically it's it's ticking all of those boxes so center of the world and  
now it's not 5 minutes in now it's two and a half decades in yes and and having  
said that you know so I work very closely with the Alman brothers from Los Angeles they're on million dollars to Los Angeles yeah so they're sending a  
lot of clients from the US yeah they celebrities lot of big names A lot of  
people they want to relocate here because it's a mess in the US you've only got to go and visit San  
Francisco in Los Angeles at the moment and it's not it's not pleasant at all there's like homeless people sleeping in  
in people's front yards everywhere I was there recently right it's  
horrific okay give me give me some advice if if if people wanted to get into the real  
estate business right now and they wanted to learn to be a real estate broker and come over here and and you  
know make their fortune or become successful what tips would you give those young arrogant nothing to lose  
type characters what tips would you give them to go out and create some success here I would tell them that it's not easy  
right so you watch shows like Million Dollar Listing and you watch other real estate reality television shows it it's  
made to look easy right you just see basically you know the deals happen but there's a lot of hard work that comes  
into it lot of Blood Sweat and Tears rejection it's uh you need to work  
hard right I would say find a good Mentor mhm right if you're starting out  
in the business find someone that you can learn from so I was very young I didn't uh I didn't learn from anyone so  
I had to learn the hard way right but now the city's grown there's a lot of  
good real estate brokers in this city if you're going to work for for a company find someone that you can sit aside or  
sit alongside and basically you can learn the tricks of the trade you can learn to become a good  
broker so understand it's not easy number number one and number two get a mentor  
give me another tip give me some other advice that these people could could really use just don't give  
up don't give up and does that apply to selling real estate or does that also apply to having a TV show I I think in  
life in general right with whatever you do I think it's all  
mindset right if you're determined if you have the drive and you're hungry and  
and persistence then you can make anything happen right I mean you're you're a live  
example yourself I could ask you some questions every while but this interv for you  
today not for me and tell me about what's coming up on  
the the shows moving forward so you got Series 2 being filmed soon or so um what I can tell you is um it's in the works  
okay yeah season two is in the works and um yeah it's going to be bigger and  
better there'll be people listening to this right now going how do I get on the show I want to get on the show what have I
