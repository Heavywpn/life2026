Intro  
0:00  
five ways to leverage your MSP email  
0:03  
marketing now if you're watching this  
0:04  
video I hope you are sending some emails  
0:06  
out to your email list and if you are  
0:08  
not that's perfectly fine this video is  
0:11  
going to set you up for success as you  
0:13  
begin to send more and more emails to  
0:16  
your list my name is Harrison Baron from  
0:18  
growth generators. we help msps with  
0:21  
sales training and marketing before I  
0:23  
get into today's video as always two  
0:25  
quick things number one Master Class  
0:27  
down in the links below number two free  
0:29  
Discord go check it out we got over a  
Free Discord  
0:31  
100 people in there it's consistently  
0:33  
growing it's super super cool it's the  
0:36  
I've made it super easy Now growth  
0:41  
dgeneral get you right in there so let's  
0:44  
talk about five ways to make your email  
0:46  
marketing much much better now I do not  
0:49  
care if you use MailChimp which is crazy  
0:52  
for me to say if you use gohigh level  
0:54  
HubSpot whatever email platform you  
0:57  
decide to use these five tips are  
0:59  
thoroughly thoroughly applicable and I'm  
1:01  
even going to share my screen out and  
1:03  
show you in a test scenario how you can  
1:06  
go through and actually use these so you  
1:08  
could really be effective number one is  
1:10  
going to be segmenting your email list  
1:12  
believe it or not everyone should not be  
1:15  
getting the same emails I know it sounds  
1:18  
crazy right but if somebody downloads  
1:20  
something on your website or if somebody  
1:21  
comes in or maybe you're already dealing  
1:23  
with a customer you don't want to send  
1:25  
them more of your email marketing I mean  
1:27  
you might want to they might be  
1:28  
interested in seeing it but for the most  
1:30  
part you want to be able to segment and  
1:31  
start breaking up different areas of  
1:34  
people now you may be sitting there and  
1:36  
thinking Harrison I don't get any emails  
1:38  
on my email list even though I have a  
1:40  
website that's okay that video is coming  
1:42  
very very very soon on how to get people  
1:44  
in there and I've already made videos  
1:46  
similar to that on the channel so if  
1:48  
you've made it if you're watching this  
1:50  
video hit that like button that  
1:51  
subscribe button notification Bell and  
1:53  
then go back to the channel and look for  
1:54  
a helpful video for you so you have to  
Segment  
1:57  
learn a segment and segmenting is  
1:59  
probably probably in my opinion the most  
2:01  
important thing when it comes to  
2:03  
actually building out an email list and  
2:06  
sending out effective emails so this is  
2:08  
all you know at example.org right random  
2:11  
madeup things and probably chat GPT  
2:13  
created a lot of these but in here we  
2:15  
have tags and these tags are really  
2:17  
interesting so we can make as many tags  
2:19  
as we want and this is the back end of  
2:21  
go high level so we have uh like this is  
2:23  
just a an example but burst appointment  
2:26  
uh booked content marketing webinar  
2:28  
clicked burst form submission One open  
2:31  
email marketing right what they've  
2:32  
subscribed to maybe they came in from a  
2:33  
Google ad but being able to see who came  
2:36  
in from where is really really important  
2:39  
because this now gives us the ability to  
2:42  
say hey let's take everyone that came in  
2:44  
from a Facebook ad we know the Facebook  
2:46  
ads that we're running and let's send  
2:47  
them maybe a special offer or something  
2:50  
of that nature you really want to make  
2:52  
sure that what you're sending out goes  
2:55  
really well with that that target  
2:57  
audience now I will be fully transparent  
3:00  
I have a stack of business cards here  
3:02  
that stack of business cards is  
3:04  
fantastic here's the thing these  
3:07  
business cards that I have some of them  
3:08  
are not all business cards but this  
3:10  
stack of business cards that I have is  
3:13  
people that I've either met out  
3:14  
networking or they're never going to be  
3:16  
a client I don't want to include this  
3:18  
stack of people in an email that I  
3:20  
created for manage service providers  
3:23  
that would be really weird while it  
3:25  
might help them understand who I'm  
3:26  
targeting it's probably not the best  
3:29  
thing in the world world for me to have  
3:31  
that and then they see it and it really  
3:32  
doesn't make sense or maybe they get one  
3:35  
email that tells them about who I am but  
3:37  
they shouldn't get all the rest of the  
3:38  
email marketing that I actually produce  
3:40  
my own business same thing for yours so  
3:43  
this is why it's really important to  
3:45  
make sure that you're tagging things  
3:47  
appropriately number two and I can't  
Educate  
3:49  
stress this this enough is educate don't  
3:53  
sell if you want a prime example of that  
3:55  
I will use myself as an example I am all  
3:58  
about educating I am all about giving as  
4:01  
much value as humanly possible with  
4:03  
actionable steps so you can follow along  
4:06  
and do these things I want to educate  
4:09  
every single one of you and a lot of  
4:11  
msps really struggle with giving out the  
4:13  
secret sauce it proves that you actually  
4:16  
know what you're talking about I just  
4:17  
received some fan mail the other day and  
4:19  
it melted my heart because it's changing  
4:21  
people's businesses I spend my time  
4:24  
creating content and creating emails to  
4:27  
make sure that you guys crush it I'm all  
4:29  
about educating the sales will come I'll  
4:31  
figure out things to sell I have a  
4:33  
massively cool new project that I'm  
4:34  
working on that's launching probably 31  
4:37  
spoiler alert um but this is the best  
4:40  
part about it is I get to educate you  
4:42  
guys and you get to educate your  
4:45  
customers the people that are inside of  
Customer Education  
4:48  
your CRM once again go high level all of  
4:50  
these people if they are your Target  
4:52  
customers need to be educated on what  
4:55  
you do how you do it current hacks that  
4:57  
are happening MGM just got hand got  
4:59  
hacked I believe 23 of me just got  
5:01  
hacked last pass has been hacked I mean  
5:03  
the amount of hacks that have happened  
5:05  
is important to know and you can  
5:07  
leverage that educate people this is why  
5:09  
we change our passwords or make sure we  
5:11  
put special characters and we make sure  
5:13  
it's at least 12 to 16 characters long  
5:16  
and for some of you crazy people out  
5:17  
there doing 32 characters God bless you  
5:20  
this is what it's really all about is  
5:23  
educating your list now grant that I  
5:25  
only have I have 104 people in here that  
5:27  
we could just go Page by Page by Page  
5:30  
all of examples but you could see opens  
5:32  
right and you could create whatever tag  
5:34  
you have in there maybe they visit a  
5:35  
landing page maybe they visited a  
5:36  
webinar a special training you provided  
5:39  
both in person you take the card and you  
5:41  
add the tags manually or remotely and it  
5:43  
automatically adds your stuff to it I'm  
5:46  
going to cover automations at the end of  
5:48  
this video but really think about ways  
5:51  
that you can educate your target market  
5:53  
it makes them understand that you know  
Personalized  
5:56  
what you're doing and that is the most  
5:59  
important thing is your customer knowing  
6:01  
that you are the expert and more often  
6:04  
than not if you implement this video  
6:06  
your competitors are not doing this I  
6:08  
could almost guarantee it number three  
6:11  
is personalized we already talked about  
6:13  
segmenting but people want things  
6:15  
personalized we thank God in today's day  
6:18  
and age have the ability to write hey  
6:20  
personalized name or whatever it is and  
6:23  
you can personalize your messages or if  
6:26  
you have a very small subset of  
6:27  
customers maybe you're an MSP focus on  
6:29  
the medical field and you have maybe  
6:32  
surgeons general practitioners and then  
6:34  
dentists maybe you want to send a  
6:37  
special deal or discount or mention to  
6:40  
specifically dentists that does not go  
6:43  
out to the rest of your your audience  
6:47  
that's one number two is really make it  
6:50  
like it's from you yes we all have  
6:53  
access to chat PT our customers know  
6:56  
that we have act most of our customers  
6:58  
know what ch chat GPT is chat GPT is  
7:02  
really good at giving you lifeless  
7:06  
content it's up to you maybe you want to  
7:08  
use chat jpt I'm thinking about doing a  
7:10  
video and if I should do a video or if  
7:12  
you think that I need to add something  
7:13  
to this video or please let me know down  
7:15  
in the comments what platform you send  
7:17  
your email marketing through down below  
7:19  
but if if you think I should make a chat  
7:21  
GPT video please let me know I'd be  
7:23  
really interested in seeing who wants to  
7:24  
see it because I am definitely a master  
7:26  
at it but personalize make it really  
7:28  
about your Target customer you can make  
7:31  
and get tons of General content you can  
7:33  
even buy it from people on the internet  
7:36  
and they are MSP people that are selling  
7:39  
generic content that you can use and  
7:41  
leverage but it isn't for your Target  
7:43  
customer and most of the time it is  
7:46  
lifeless and colorless and soulless your  
7:50  
customer wants to know that you're  
7:52  
educating them and not selling them they  
7:54  
feel like that message is directly  
7:57  
geared towards them and it really feels  
8:00  
like a message that your company sends  
8:02  
out you are allowed to have a brand and  
8:04  
a personality if you leverage that and  
8:07  
really dial it in into your email  
8:09  
marketing people eat your emails up  
8:12  
which guess what they're going to know  
8:14  
you they're going to like you they're  
8:15  
going to trust you and they're going to  
8:17  
believe that you are a source for  
8:19  
Quality education and they can really  
8:21  
build a relationship with you so you  
8:23  
have to personalize it takes a bit  
8:25  
longer of course it does I spent two and  
8:28  
a half hours on an email on one email  
8:31  
today but that email was fantastic and I  
8:34  
was super super proud of it so please  
8:36  
please please please personalize as much  
8:38  
as you can and make it feel like it's  
8:40  
not just an email blast that goes to  
8:42  
everybody in their mother number four is  
8:45  
automations and triggers you should be  
Automations  
8:47  
able to automate just about everything  
8:49  
now I use go high level so this is what  
8:52  
we do so I have one of my vas Julius  
8:54  
working on some stuff and he's  
8:55  
constantly testing and experimenting  
8:57  
with different things but here's just  
8:59  
just a quick little test that he made so  
9:00  
we have the burst email  
9:02  
Automation and we have a form submitted  
9:05  
right so they're going to fill out a  
9:06  
form when that form is submitted we're  
9:08  
going to get notified and they're going  
9:10  
to get tagged right right here for burst  
9:12  
form submission burst form submission  
9:14  
landing page right and I just did a a  
9:16  
webinar uh a webinar click for a tag we  
9:19  
can tell it to wait wait five minutes  
9:22  
before it sends them a basic thank you  
9:25  
email super cool makes it very very nice  
9:29  
easy now when we actually send these out  
9:31  
we actually get all the data here which  
9:32  
is really really cool but we can trigger  
9:35  
on thing events that people are doing we  
9:37  
could trigger on video tracking twilio  
9:41  
email events customer replies to our  
9:43  
messages I mean the list goes on and on  
9:46  
we can do event based triggers we can do  
9:47  
form based  
9:49  
triggers one of the reasons why I love  
9:51  
go high level there is an affiliate link  
9:52  
down below and I'm not just saying it  
9:54  
because we use it it genuinely is one of  
9:57  
the best platforms out there in my  
9:58  
opinion opinion new sales memberships I  
10:01  
mean the amount of triggers maybe they  
10:03  
buy something and then they get a new  
10:05  
email it says hey by the way we know you  
10:06  
bought this I think you'd also like this  
10:08  
as well we can trigger based on anything  
10:11  
or maybe an email sequence that says  
10:13  
that adds tremendous value because  
10:14  
you've sent out a proposal to the  
10:16  
customer but triggering and automations  
10:19  
are key to making your life easy and the  
10:22  
nice part is is we're data people that's  
Tracking  
10:25  
the best part we can look at the data  
10:27  
how's this email performing is it good  
10:29  
can we optimize it can we make it better  
10:31  
oh a lot of people aren't opening this  
10:33  
email what do we need to fix to get more  
10:35  
people to open the email to see the  
10:38  
value that we provide and maybe click on  
10:39  
the link or they'll buy from us the list  
10:42  
goes on and on we can automate and do  
10:46  
tons of stuff through automations once  
10:48  
again I use go high level you can use  
10:50  
HubSpot  
10:52  
aweber MailChimp in some weird ways but  
10:56  
pick a platform that you know keep  
10:58  
infusion soft Salesforce it does not  
11:00  
matter just pick a platform and get good  
11:03  
at it it's so simple and then as your  
11:06  
list grows and you start getting more  
11:08  
and more people and they start doing  
11:09  
different actions on your website you  
11:11  
can start to trigger off emails hey we  
11:13  
saw that you visited our Dental page  
11:15  
want them to take a moment to send out  
11:16

11:24

11:26

11:28  
for us and then number five which goes  
11:31  
right into that which is tracking and  
11:33  
optimizing I know it sounds so silly but  
11:36  
the amount of people that just send out  
11:39  
mindless email marketing and hope that  
11:42

11:47

12:09  
create more content like this but you  
12:12  
can't measure what you don't track and  
12:14  
if you don't measure and you don't track  
12:15

0:47  
things number one we still have that  
0:49  
giveaway going on it's got a couple days  
0:51  
left so if you're watching this video  
0:54  
before December 20th 2023 there's going  
0:57  
to be a link down below I've partnered  
0:59  
up with a company called Bill ways they  
1:00  
do automated billing for msps and it  
1:02  
Pros it is a super cool platform that  
1:05

1:06  
annual subscriptions and they've also  
1:08  
contributed to the giveaway from solid  
1:10  
state drives flash drives to everything  
1:12  
in MSP salesperson will need to crush it  
1:15  
out there number two master class as  
1:18  
always down in the links below I'm super  
1:20  
excited the new master class is almost  
1:22  
here please be patient we are working so  
1:24  
incredibly hard on this project and  
1:27  
number three if you're watching this  
1:29  
before for the first week of January the  
1:31  
MSP Launchpad is right around the corner  
1:33  
if you are just starting out in your MSP  
1:35  
or you've just started and you're still  
1:37  
kind of not exactly sure what to do to  
1:39  
help grow your business it's a six-week  
1:41  
boot camp starting in the beginning of  
1:43  
January that will also be linked down  
1:45  
below and if who knows if it's after  
1:47  
that I'm going to be probably be running  
1:48  
it again you guys have been giving me  
1:50  
amazing feedback over and over and over  
1:52  
again and already I have a ton of people  
1:54  
interested in potentially another one  
1:56  
down the road so let's get into today's  
1:59  
video so let's talk about the state of  
2:01  
the MSP industry long long time ago  
2:04  
there was a company out there that  
2:06  
basically told msps the absolute worst  
2:09  
information out there and that  
2:11  
information was look super professional  
2:14  
and don't put too much content on your  
2:16  
website now these are generally the  
2:19  
worst bits of advice that you could  
2:21  
possibly give a company you still want  
2:22  
to look professional don't get me wrong  
2:25  
but not having enough content on your  
2:27  
website is probably the worst thing and  
2:30  
because of that every MSP looks the  
2:34  
exact same it's actually comical and  
2:37  
I've done it a couple times on video and  
2:39  
I'm going to do it again today where if  
2:41  
you look at all of these MSP websites  
2:44  
they don't look cookie cutter but if  
2:46  
they were all in a line without logos  
2:48  
you wouldn't know what company owned  
2:50  
which one of them there's literally no  
2:53  
differentiation out there and number two  
2:56  
most msps just do the same thing anyway  
2:59  
anyway there's nothing that they want to  
3:01  
do or nothing that they think about that  
3:03  
differentiates themselves over and over  
3:06  
and over again on top of that they're  
3:07  
not producing case studies they're not  
3:09  
telling anybody hey this is what we're  
3:11  
doing this is who we've helped in the  
3:12  
area this is who we've helped nationally  
3:14  
none of that is happening so right off  
3:17  
the bat the first thing that you have to  
3:19  
do is identify your Niche and it is the  
3:22  
most important thing I know you guys are  
3:24  
probably sick and tired of hearing the  
3:26  
buyer persona but if you are struggling  
3:28  
to go find your target market you have  
3:31  
to go through this buyer persona it's  
3:33  
super super simple personal information  
3:35  
create a fake customer or if you have a  
3:37  
dream customer that you absolutely love  
3:40  
first name last name a little bit about  
3:42  
them right their gender their age their  
3:44  
location their demographics  
3:46  
psychographics behavior and hobbies  
3:48  
we're going to sneak down a little bit  
3:49  
pain points and if you want the rest of  
3:50  
them go grab that link down below but  
3:52  
fill this out if you blow past all the  
3:56  
the lines in here that's okay open up a  
3:58  
notepad write it all out get as much  
4:01  
down as possible because this is the  
4:03  
Cornerstone believe it or not for your  
4:06  
growth everything that you do going  
4:08  
forward is for this specific person it  
4:13  
sounds crazy but hear me out I promise  
4:15  
it's all going to make sense as time  
4:17  
goes on but you have to have this now  
4:19  
let's talk about some msps I've pulled  
4:21  
up a quick little Google map of local  
4:24  
msps in Charlotte that's where I live  
4:26  
now I used to live up on Long Island as  
4:28  
many of you guys know but  
4:30  
these are a bunch of msps I just went  
4:32  
through and grabbed some of these which  
4:33  
I think is great but there was one that  
4:35  
didn't actually have a website area yeah  
4:38  
there's no website for this one I  
4:39  
thought that was kind of weird you're in  
4:41  
technology you should probably have a  
4:43  
website so let's start going through all  
4:44  
these cuz I just did a local Google  
4:46  
search and just wanted to see who the  
4:48  
competition is out there and the first  
4:50  
thing you have to do is understand who  
4:51  
you're competing against so kudos to  
4:54  
them for giving out a free ebook  
4:55  
Charlotte IT solutions they talk a  
4:57  
little bit about them and look at that  
4:59  
that's the whole page I'm getting it's  
5:01  
pretty rough now granted this is an ad  
5:04  
or I believe that this was the ad but  
5:06  
there's just not enough there for that I  
5:08  
I actually think that that's probably  
5:10  
the worst landing page you should add  
5:12  
quite a bit more in here but our  
5:14  
certifications I like this you can go  
5:16  
through this whole website and see kind  
5:18  
of what they offer now this is fairly  
5:20  
well built out once again very  
5:22  
professional I like that but nothing  
5:24  
jumps out at me saying like wow this is  
5:26  
a company I'd be super excited to work  
5:28  
with doesn't seem like they're talking  
5:32  
about me as the customer right  
5:34  
satisfaction guarantee serving Charlotte  
5:36  
that's okay who do they work  
5:39

5:43  
makes us unique that's cool businesses  
5:45  
we serve small businesses and mid  
5:47  
midsize businesses good cookie cutter I  
5:49  
like that no differentiation I don't  
5:51  
even know if I should bring them my  
5:52  
business let's go to the next one phro  
5:55  
it are you ready to put an end to  
5:57  
expensive frustration computer problems

6:01  
big reasons why businesses Outsource  
6:03  
their computer it support to us that's  
6:05  
cool our  
6:07  
services business owners are saying who

we partnered  
6:11  
with it's almost the exact same website  
6:15  
for the most part okay cool we'll just  
6:17  
keep moving from there um  
6:20  
AET expert tips.net manage service  
6:23  
provider this is cool we can go through  
6:25  
this not one of these so far has  
6:29  
mentioned the type of customer that they  
6:32  
really want to work with that's a huge  
6:34  
red flag yeah this is cool like every  
6:37  
MSP is going to be making similar offers  
6:40  
and similar claims but the amount of  
6:43  
msps out there that don't actually say  
6:46  
who they want to work with or who their  
6:48  
favorite customers are is crazy see Ser

6:56  
companies Great Services offerings from  
6:58  
lead Network it support Community this  
7:00  
is great but once again there's nothing  
7:03  
that differentiates I could go through  
7:05  
just about every single MSP website out  
7:09  
there not a single one of them says hey  
7:13  
if this is you we would literally love  
7:17  
to work with you it doesn't happen it's  
7:20  
crazy to me that this doesn't exist so  
7:22  
when you're first starting out when you  
7:24  
have to understand who's out there on  
7:26  
that MSP landscape who's out there what  
7:28  
are they doing and then after that you  
7:31  
can then go through do that buer Persona  
7:33  
I didn't make the thing for my health I  
7:35  
made it so you guys can go kill it and  
7:37  
some of you that have implemented it are  
7:38  
starting to see the success as it rolls  
7:41  
in it's super cool go fill that out and  
7:44  
really put the time and energy and  
7:45  
effort into going through  
7:48  
and defining who your dream customer is  
7:53  
think about it this way I'm going to  
7:54  
give you a quick little mind shift if a  
7:56  
restaurant sells Italian food they don't  
7:59  
only make it for Italian people but if  
8:01  
it's true authentic Italian Italian  
8:05  
people possibly from their original  
8:08  
country are going there to enjoy that  
8:12  
food that's the big differentiator  
8:16  
between them and everybody else out  
8:18  
there you have modern Italian modern  
8:21  
styles all of that but if it's a true  
8:23  
authentic Place everyone else can enjoy  
8:25  
it but they're making it for people that  
8:28  
are now in the area who miss that true  
8:30  
sense of home that is really the big  
8:33  
difference between all of these so think  
8:36  
about it like that when you're going  
8:38  
through it number two let's talk about  
8:40  
differentiations in your business right  
8:42  
we've already talked about that buyer  
8:44  
Persona which is really really important  
8:46  
what additional services are you going  
8:48  
to offer now I've pulled up my MSP map  
8:51  
here there's a link down below for this  
8:53  
you can go through this and by the way  
8:55  
first of all if you've made it this far  
8:57  
one I have to say thank you for watch  
8:59  
watching the video this long two if you  
9:00  
want to hit that like button subscribe  
9:02  
button little notification Bell I would  
9:04  
appreciate the heck out of you for doing  
9:05  
that and if you are interested in this  
9:08  
MSP map a lot of you guys have asked hey  
9:10  
we can't print it out I have put  
9:13  
together and and I'm thinking about it  
9:14  
but if you want this please leave a  
9:16  
comment down below a actual mailed to  
9:20  
your house version of this it's pretty  
9:22  
cheap it'll be printed out fully and  
9:24  
professionally but you can go mount it  
9:26  
for your home your office or whatever it  
9:28  
is that way it's not a giant ton of  
9:31  
pieces of paper and you're doing some  
9:32  
kind of weird print job I apologize but  
9:34  
it's a lot for an MSP we have your MSP  
9:37  
up here compliance what services are you  
9:40  
going to offer or add in that are going  
9:42  
to make your businesses different we  
9:45  
have one-time Services we have all of  
9:47  
the main services that an MSP is going  
9:49  
to offer but maybe you're going to offer  
9:51  
something that's a little less  
9:52  
traditional Security Services CIO print  
9:56  
services phone services web services  
9:58  
cyber Security Services and maybe more  
10:01  
advanced networking you're going to  
10:02  
offer some levels of networking right  
10:04  
off the rip but maybe you want to offer  
10:06  
in or be the guy that does cable runs or  
10:08  
switch management or sets up plenty of  
10:11  
vpns you can do dark web scans there's a  
10:14  
whole ton of ways to get creative when  
10:16  
it starts to come to these areas so  
10:19  
let's talk about the second thing which  
10:20  
is going to be building a a strong brand  
10:23  
identity if we think of an apple the one  
10:26  
that you eat we would have never  
10:28  
converted it over to a phone it just we  
10:31  
would have never thought about that  
10:33  
these two an apple I should probably get  
10:34  
an Apple give me one  
10:37  
second so apple right and apple there's  
10:41  
two different kinds of apples the  
10:43  
company builds the brand the brand does  
10:48  
not build the company if you did a check  
10:50  
mark nobody would ever think that it was  
10:53  
Nike until Nike built the brand around  
10:57  
the check mark and the phrase just do it  
11:01  
apples back in the day everyone always  
11:03  
thought about this but if you say I have  
11:05  
an apple more often than not they're  
11:08  
thinking of an Apple product a watch a  
11:11  
phone a laptop a ridiculously expensive  
11:14  
pair of headphones the list goes on and  
11:17  
on your company the way you create your  
11:20  
messaging the way you create your blogs  
11:22  
the way you create your content builds  
11:25  
into your brand that the important part  
11:30  
and showing people publicly all of those  
11:34  
things that is what goes out and builds  
11:37  
your brand the brand is not bought if I  
11:40  
said Mouse you might think of this you  
11:43  
might also think of an actual Mouse you  
11:45  
might think of a toy mouse maybe for  
11:47  
cats you might think of Mickey Mouse the  
11:50  
word Mouse is so  
11:54  
generic you have to build things into  
11:58  
the brand the the brand is not created  
12:00  
you don't just think of like hey this  
12:01  
would be really cool if it was a hook  
12:03  
for our logo and that's it we're we're  
12:05  
hook it and we're going to we're going  
12:07  
to bring youall in under our hook I'm  
12:09  
just making things up at this point but  
12:11  
you get the drift you have to build the  
12:14  
brand your logo can change down the road  
12:17  
your messaging is always going to be  
12:19  
changing bringing on a brand developer  
12:22  
does not help in the beginning down the  
12:24  
road 100% but in the beginning think of  
12:27  
something unique something catchy and  
12:29  
show your voice as the MSP owner or if  
12:32  
you work for an MSP explain that to your  
12:36  
higher hups hey I want to talk more  
12:38  
about who we really are what makes us so  
12:41  
unique versus every other MSP out there  
12:45  
that's going to be the real difference  
12:47  
and just like these websites that we  
12:48  
were going  
12:50  
through you know Charlotte it yeah  
12:52  
that's a cool kind of brand you know  
12:54  
small business Panther yeah faroq it  
13:00  
a.net Buchanan Technologies these are  
13:02  
all fine companies but nothing about  
13:06  
their messaging all of this tells me wow  
13:10  
they are a really strong brand it just  
13:12  
shows me the most generic information  
13:15  
out there so as you're going through as  
13:16  
you build out that buyer Persona use  
13:19  
this buyer Persona as that guide to go  
13:22  
through and actually create something or  
13:25  
a website that somebody feels like wow  
13:28  
this is just just the kind of company  
13:30  
that I'm actually looking for and then  
13:32  
after you go through all this now think  
13:35  
about ways to make it high touch we all  
13:37  
know that I love go high level if you  
13:38  
want to go get go high level it is down  
13:40  
in the links below it is a fantastic CRM  
13:43  
but here's the reason why I brought it  
13:44  
up I didn't just bring it up because I'm  
13:46  
trying to make affiliate money go high  
13:48  
level has the ability to send texts and  
13:51  
emails as people become come through  
13:53  
your pipeline As you move them through  
13:55  
the state the deal stages which is nice  
13:57  
because it turns it into a more High  
14:00  
touch more tailored more  
14:04  
hey this is the guy this is our customer  
14:07  
and I want to make you feel like your  
14:09  
family they want to feel like they're a  
14:12  
part of it that's going to be the big  
14:14  
difference so that's why another reason  
14:16  
why I love go high level it just makes  
14:18  
it that much better I promise you if I  
14:21  
called or emailed any of these companies  
14:23  
I wouldn't get a text message back I  
14:25  
might get an automated email back but  
14:26  
nothing would make me feel great it  
14:29  
would be very very vanilla just like  
14:31  
their playing websites they're not bad  
14:33  
they're very professional looking but  
14:34  
there's nothing about them that says hey  
14:36  
this is who we would love to work with  
14:38  
or the couple niches we would kill to  
14:41  
work with it's very cookie cutter it's  
14:43  
very boring it's very stagnant and  
14:47  
that's going to be the big  
14:48  
differentiator implementing go high  
14:50  
level as many of you guys have already  
14:52  
gotten text messages and probably some  
14:53  
emails from me it makes life  
14:56  
significantly easier constantly being  
14:59  
able to touch base and also increases  
15:01  
your customer  
15:03  
experience it makes them feel like they  
15:06  
are a part of a business that genuinely  
15:09  
cares about them that's going to be the  
15:12  
big differentiator between you and  
15:14  
everybody else I actually did an  
15:16  
experiment and I may have mentioned this  
15:17  
on a previous video I called four or  
15:20  
five  
15:21  
msps in a row in a certain area none of  
15:25  
them answered their phones I didn't even  
15:28  
get a phone call back some of it went to  
15:31  
their cell phones I didn't even get a  
15:33  
phone call back from them by answering  
15:36  
the phone sending out these automated  
15:37  
text messages and emails and building a  
15:40  
system that actually works  
15:42  
leveraging quality technology will  
15:45  
immediately make you stand out among  
15:47  
everyone else believe it or not the bar  
15:50  
is so incredibly  
15:54  
low why not take advantage of it there  
15:56  
is so much opportunity out there so  
16:00  
we're going to talk about the benefit  
16:02  
beneficial services to offer you're  
16:04  
pretty much going to be going through  
16:05  
here you might find some extra  
16:07  
interesting things that you want to  
16:08  
throw in there and I would love to hear  
16:11  
what your what what you are offering  
16:14  
please leave a comment if you think that  
16:15  
I'm missing something on here or you're  
16:17  
like Harrison I tried this new thing  
16:19  
that was that worked like Gang Busters  
16:23  
that is exactly what I want to hear  
16:25  
please let me know I'd be very very  
16:27  
interested to see what people are doing  
16:28  
to help offer additional services to  
16:32  
their customers and maybe you're even  
16:33  
charging a little bit more for that but  
16:36  
a lot of this is going to be cybercity  
16:38  
Solutions cloud services automated  
16:40  
Solutions with your rmm and PSA tools  
16:42  
and then you have a little bit of  
16:43  
compliance if you're doing compliance  
16:45  
where there's a lot of money to be made  
16:46  
but a lot of Hoops to jump through  
16:48  
compliance is a fantastic way to go into  
16:51  
it and make your customers feel like  
16:53  
what they're getting isn't just cookie  
16:56  
cutter over and over and over again make  
16:58  
them feel like it is a solution tailored  
17:01  
to them your pricing doesn't need to  
17:03  
change but the way you word it and the  
17:05  
way you present it with your brand with  
17:08  
your buyer Persona in mind with your  
17:10  
website all increases the amount of  
17:13  
money that you get to charge but makes  
17:15  
the customer feel like you really go  
17:17  
above and beyond for their industry and  
17:19  
when they sign up with you you are going  
17:21  
to absolutely knock it out of the park  
17:24  
that's the big difference so number four  
17:28  
I do want to touch on this cuz I think  
17:29  
it's really important as you're building  
17:31  
your brand you have to build  
17:33  
relationships and a network of people  
17:36  
that you know like and Trust if you've  
17:39  
heard this before I apologize CU it is  
17:41  
something that I like to drive home join  
17:44

17:47  
reason being they love helping your  
17:49  
local community number two it is almost

17:58  
buyer persona but you're going to learn

## Transcript

Intro  
0:00  
I'm going to show you step by step on  
0:02

0:05  
beginning to end everything in between  
0:09  
I'm not holding anything back as a  
0:11  
website builder myself with building

0:16  
bring back and show you basically  
0:19  
everything that you need to have a  
0:21  
fantastic starter website now the what  
0:24  
I'm showing you is a slightly modified  
0:27  
process than what a designer would  
0:29  
actually go do but this is to get you  
0:32  
from I don't have a website to something  
0:34  
you are proud of and you don't feel  
0:36  
embarrassed about when you say hey this  
0:38  
is my website so we're going to be  
0:40  
covering all of that in today's video  
0:43  
this is going to be a bit of a longer  
0:46  
video so you're probably going to want  
0:47  
to grab yourself a bottle of water  
0:49  
something like that get ready to go on a  
0:52  
learning experience with me my name is  
0:54  
Harrison Baron from  
0:58  
growth-at-all-costs  
1:00  
and marketing to help them grow online  
1:04  
before I get into today's video couple  
1:06  
quick things number one master class as  
1:08  
always down in the links below if you  
1:10  
haven't gotten it already it's worth  
1:12  
getting the new one now that I'm not  
1:14  
sick I can start recording I was kind of  
1:16  
waiting to get over uh my full-blown  
1:18  
sickness of having the flu not that  
1:19  
anyone needs to know that but hey you're  
1:21  
welcome number two if you haven't joined  
1:23  
the Discord already I don't know what  
1:24  
you're waiting for it's completely free  
1:26  
there's a link down below jump in the  
1:27  
Discord come hang out with us it's a  
1:29  
great community of MPS that are  
1:30  
currently getting into it so let's get  
1:33  
into the building of a website and  
1:36  
ultimately a brand that we have to build  
1:38  
now once again this is a modified  
1:40  
version of what a designer would follow  
1:44  
and I'm going to share with you guys  
Creating A Company  
1:45  
exactly what I would do so inside of Wix  
1:48  
there will be a link down below if you'd  
1:49  
like to use Wix they want to talk about  
1:52  
your site so we before we even get  
1:54  
involved and I've pre-loaded some tabs  
1:56  
too but before we even get involved in  
1:59  
building out the site we have to come up  
2:01  
with some structure of a company because  
2:04  
in reality we can't just go head first  
2:07  
into uh the great worldwide web and and  
2:10  
this blank area here we need to come up  
2:12  
with some kind of idea of what we're  
2:14  
going to be doing so I'm going to use  
2:15  
chat GPT to help accelerate this process  
2:18  
because I don't feel like coming up with  
2:19  
all of it myself and that you know makes  
2:21  
it for a fun video so I'm going to say  
2:23  
hey chat I need to create a  
2:28  
logo and branding package for an MSP  
2:32  
that  
2:34  
targets accounting firms and tax  
2:40  
professionals and that's really all I'm  
2:43  
going to tell it can you create a  
2:46  
branding and Logo guide that I can  
2:51  
follow to help build an amazing  
2:55  
website now I'm giving it completely  
2:58  
free reign on what I would normally ask  
3:01  
for it so I'm going to actually now that  
3:03  
it's creating some of these things I'm  
3:05  
just going to have it make all of this  
3:06  
for me so once it stops giving me  
3:10  
information here we're going to see  
3:12  
exactly what it can create for  
3:19  
us so it's already given me a logo which  
3:22  
I mean I'm probably going to use for  
3:24  
this video but I probably would go back  
3:26  
and tweak and modify it but now I want  
3:28  
to actually have it do a lot of the work  
3:30  
for us I don't really want to sit here  
3:31  
and do the work so I'm going to pretend  
3:33  
and have it give me all of the  
3:35  
information so I don't even want  
3:38  
to think about it right we have secure  
3:41  
Ledger MSP right the industry manage  
3:43  
services Target uh Market who it's  
3:46  
targeting core Services their mission  
3:48  
statement their vision statement all of  
3:50  
these are actually really really  
3:51  
important for this and I basically just  
3:55  
told it to make things up so it's giving  
3:57  
us the founding story it's going to tell  
3:58  
us the services offer offered all of  
4:00  
that kind of stuff that we would need to  
4:02  
help go through and build this company  
4:05  
per se it's giv me colors it's giving me  
4:09  
uh the logo design it's giving me  
4:11  
typography here marketing strategy of  
4:13  
who I want to go Target a growth plan  
4:15  
for my MSP and it gives me a ton of  
4:18  
information so let's start getting into  
4:20  
this let's go through and let's start to  
4:23  
plug this into Wix does offer a  
4:26  
full-blown AI website builder so let's  
4:29  
go in here here uh what do you want to  
4:30  
call your site secure Ledger MSP and  
4:33  
it's basically just going to ask me what  
4:35  
the business is about and we've already  
4:38  
filled all of this stuff out we can tell  
4:40  
it the company overview the mission  
4:41  
statement core values and the founding  
4:44  
story so let's just give it all of it I  
4:46  
mean make our lives easier and I even  
4:49  
cut off a little bit there it's going to  
4:51  
pick it up this is what AI can do  
4:52  
thankfully so let's see what it's going  
4:54  
to kick back to us Charlotte North  
4:57  
Carolina because why not that's where I  
4:58  
live  
5:00  
and I'm just going to give it all of  
5:02  
this information I don't think there  
5:04  
it's worth even hiding anything else  
5:06  
from it I'm just going to give it all of  
5:09  
it so that way it knows  
5:11  
exactly what to do how to do it and the  
5:13  
AI is actually going to start crafting  
5:15  
us a fantastic website and because we've  
5:18  
already used a lot of  
5:20  
AI it knows exactly what it needs it's  
5:23  
we're giving it probably more  
5:24  
information than it actually needs to  
5:26  
build a website but I'd rather give it  
5:28  
more than less in this area and I just  
5:30  
wanted to have a modern design and clean  
5:35  
feel and that's it so let's see what  
5:38  
it'll give us back now that it kind of  
5:40  
knows exactly who we're targeting and  
5:42  
and all of that information which is in  
5:44  
reality if you were to go out and build  
5:46  
this and I'm going to take a moment to  
5:47  
change this if you were to go out and  
5:48  
build this this is exactly what you need  
5:51  
any MSP or or better yet any designer  
5:54  
that builds websites for a living they  
5:56  
need to ask you a couple different  
5:58  
questions your branding guidelines your  
5:59  
colors all of that remember that buyer  
6:02  
Persona that I keep mentioning and I'm  
6:04  
going to actually bring it up here if  
6:06  
you don't have that filled out you're  
6:09  
just setting yourself back building out  
Buyer Persona Form  
6:11  
this bio Persona form is actually one of  
6:13  
the best things that you could possibly  
6:15  
go give to your designer you hand that  
6:19  
over to them and say hey this is who I  
6:21  
want to Target that way they know okay  
6:24  
we can start to work on different colors  
6:26  
we know exactly who we're targeting we  
6:27  
know what kind of messaging that we're  
6:29  
creating in the copy all of this goes  
6:31  
into it so by going through and filling  
6:33  
out your buyer Persona form actually  
6:36  
sets you significantly further ahead  
6:38  
pain points and challenges if you want  
6:40  
to download the buyer Persona there is  
6:41  
always a link down in the description  
6:43  
down below it's the most useful tool  
6:44  
I've ever built ever so let's go back to  
6:47  
Wix and let's see what they're doing  
6:48  
this is great with the modern clean  
6:50  
design website will have a Sleek  
6:51  
professional look rest assured that  
6:53  
you'll be able to achieve that in the  
6:55  
Wix editor is there anything else I  
6:56  
should know nope that's  
6:58  
all  
Website Design  
7:01  
and now it's going to give us probably a  
7:04  
website at least a good starting point  
7:06  
this is not to give you a website that  
7:08  
is going to shatter the Earth and it's  
7:10  
going to be the next apple this is  
7:12

7:19  
let's see what it's built for us this  
7:21  
has taken all of 8 minutes currently of  
7:25  
live time it's going to be sped up in  
7:26  
the recording here but now it's going to  
7:28  
come through and it's going to give us  
7:30  
the back end of this business let's go  
7:32  
through let's design the site right we  
7:34  
have we have Services we can set up  
7:36  
payments connect your domain all of that  
7:38

7:39

Charlotte North Carolina we'll leave the  
7:59  
phone number blank Social Links we'll  
8:00  
leave those blank too obviously you  
8:02  
would make those but for in this case  
8:05  
we're going to go through it we're going  
8:06

cover the dos the do Nots and I'm even  
0:23  
going to go through a couple MSP  
0:25  
websites some of them that are ranked  
0:27  
allegedly on Google as some of the best  
0:30  
MSP websites and also some of my  
0:33  
subscribers they've thrown in some  
0:35  
websites as well so I want to share that  
0:37  
with you guys today in today's video  
0:39  
before I get into today's video I do  
0:41  
have a couple quick things that I'd like  
0:42  
to mention one if you haven't grabbed  
0:44  
the master class there is a master class  
0:46  
down in the description down below two  
0:48  
if you haven't joined the Discord yet I  
0:50  
don't really know what you're waiting  
0:51  
for it's 100% free there's a link down  
0:53  
below sometimes the link breaks I  
0:55  
apologize just comment down there hey  
0:57  
Link's broken I'll just update it  
0:59  
discord's been giving me a really really  
1:00  
hard time with that link so I apologize  
1:03  
for that so let's talk about websites  
1:06  
are they good are they bad are you going  
1:08  
to get business from your website and  
1:09  
what does your website actually need to  
1:11  
do for you and ultimately think about  
1:14  
your website in the most simple terms  
1:18  
now I'm going to share with you guys  
1:20  
what you need to think about when you're  
1:21  
building your website I'm going to cover  
1:23  
all the details too that you need to  
1:24  
have but your website is a  
1:27  
24hour 36 5 no days off no sick days no  
1:33  
vacation salesperson for your business  
1:37  
that's realistically what it is now the  
1:40  
more people you drive to your website  
1:42  
the more potential sales that you can  
1:44  
have on the flip side the less people  
1:47  
you drive to your website the less sales  
1:49  
you get to have think of your website as  
1:52  
a sign in the middle of nowhere the more  
1:55  
people that you can get to drive past  
1:57  
your sign and see it the more likely you  
1:59  
are to get get some new customers so  
2:00  
let's talk about some of the more  
2:02  
important things here I've taken some  
2:03  
notes and I want to go over them number  
2:05  
one it's got to be user friendly and it  
2:08  
can't just be on the desktop I know we  
2:11  
probably spend most of our day on  
2:12  
desktop but this little device too if  
2:15  
you go on your website and you're  
2:17  
like oh I don't really love that that's  
2:21  
a clear sign that you need to adjust it  
2:23  
most of your clients are going to be on  
2:25  
here now in the MSP world we kind of get  
2:28  
to sneak by because most people are  
2:30  
going to be looking for our stuff or  
2:33  
looking at our stuff on a desktop why  
2:36  
because they're at work they're probably  
2:38  
procrastinating or they've probably been  
2:39  
tasked with go find a local  
2:42  
MSP so we do get a little bit of leeway  
2:45  
other Industries not so much but  
2:47  
thankfully that's not going to change  
2:49  
anytime soon most of the time our Target  
2:51  
customers are doing research about our  
2:53  
company on a desktop still got to have  
2:55  
it look good on mobile but it's  
2:57  
important number two clear and concise  
3:01  
content you can't just vomit everywhere  
3:04  
and just hope that it organizes itself  
3:07  
in a way that looks good and reads good  
3:10  
we all have chat GPT there's no lying  
3:13  
there use chat GPT if you're given all  
3:17  
the information say organize this into  
3:19  
three or four or five or six different  
3:21  
pages label the pages and have it give  
3:24  
you the content for each page yeah  
3:26  
there's always going to be a little bit  
3:27  
of overlap on pages but  
3:30  
there's no excuse not to have a nice  
3:33  
simply laid out website and simple is  
3:36  
always better for websites if you're  
3:39  
going we'll say hard on your website and  
3:42  
you're like cramming and trying to get  
3:44  
everything snuck in and this kind of  
3:46  
this that and the other thing it's  
3:48  
probably too much but there's also the  
3:51  
flip side you don't want it to be a  
3:53  
blank piece of paper either with no  
3:55  
information that's coming soon but you  
3:58  
don't want that either you want to have  
4:00  
enough information that people know who  
4:02  
you are what you do how you do it who  
4:04  
you service where you service them and a  
4:08  
reason for them to give you information  
4:10  
whether that's a contact us or a lead  
4:13  
magnet which brings me into a strong  
4:16  
call to action if you don't have on your  
4:19  
website buttons scattered throughout  
4:21  
strategically placed that give people a  
4:24  
reason to learn more to get more  
4:26  
information to get a free download the  
4:29  
list goes on and on and on you need to  
4:31  
have a strong call to action you don't  
4:34  
want somebody looking at your website  
4:35  
and saying I don't even know how to  
4:37  
contact these people that would be bad  
4:41  
you definitely do not want that to be  
4:43  
happening you want somebody to say hey  
4:44  
they're going to read about you they're  
4:46  
going to read the clear and concise  
4:48  
information and they are going to have  
4:50  
the opportunity to click to either call  
4:53  
book a meeting download a worksheet  
4:55  
whatever it may be so you can get their  
4:57  
contact information little bonus if  
5:00  
you're a new MSP owner this is going to  
5:02  
be a little bit more challenging if  
5:03  
you're not a new MSP owner ask people  
5:06  
for testimonials and wear them like  
5:09  
Badges of Honor on your website you have  
5:12  
worked  
5:14  
excruciatingly hard on building your  
5:16  
website finding the right host finding  
5:18  
the provider building the website  
5:21  
locating the images writing the copy  
5:23  
even if you use chat GPT setting it all  
5:26  
up and you're not going to shine and  
5:29  
highlight your case studies or  
5:31  
testimonials that you've  
5:33  
gotten don't miss that opportunity  
5:36  
people if they don't know your company  
5:39  
only have one thing to rely on and  
5:41  
that's reviews and if you can highlight  
5:43  
your reviews that's a good thing you  
5:45  
really really want that to happen and  
5:48  
then any additional features that you  
5:50  
want galleries are cool showcase if you  
5:53  
just reworked an entire server closet or  
5:55  
recabled an entire server closet or you  
5:57  
just did the crazy e EST custom build of  
6:00  
your life highlight it show people  
6:04  
you're proud of your work too many  
6:06  
people are like no no no no no no no you  
6:08  
can't see what we're working on here  
6:09  
like who who are you protecting who are  
6:12  
you hiding it from your Target customer  
6:15  
wants to see that your work is clean and  
6:18  
nice and neat and looks good anybody  
6:21  
they don't have to be in Tech can  
6:23  
appreciate a high quality cabling job  
6:25  
they might not even know what they're  
6:26  
looking at a computer what they do know  
6:28  
what they're looking at is a nice clean  
6:30  
desk with a new monitor maybe you  
6:32  
installed a nice 49in Ultra wide with a  
6:35  
nice lightup keyboard all the good stuff  
6:37  
all the works showcase that people  
6:40  
really really really want to see that  
6:43  
and make sure you have an SSL a single  
6:45  
security socket license it's like basic  
6:48  
in every website but every once in a  
6:50  
while it's when you see somebody's  
6:51  
website it's like this website maybe  
6:53  
corrupted or this website yeah that is  
6:55  
it get it it's like free on every  
6:57  
platform at this point I don't know how  
7:00  
you don't have that so let's talk about  
7:02  
some things that a bad website will do  
7:04  
super complicated navigation or no  
7:07  
navigation at all just imagine just  
7:10  
walking around hands over your eyes  
7:12  
looking for info on the company if you  
7:16  
don't have solid like it's pretty simple  
7:18  
there's a simple format I'm going to  
7:20  
cover in this video of what you should  
7:22  
do for your navigation it's not as hard  
7:25  
as you probably think it is outdated  
7:27  
design you don't have to have the most  
7:29  
modern technology or the most modern  
7:31  
design but you better bet it's not from  
7:35  
1995 that's no good like five you could  
7:39  
get away with easily five to seven years  
7:41  
with your website trust me it's not that  
7:45  
big of a deal nobody is going to buy  
7:47  
from you because they're like this  
7:50  
MSP has clearly spent all of their money  
7:54  
undesigned for this website just it's  
7:56  
it's not going to happen as long as it's  
7:58  
not super super super old super  
8:00  
Antiquated blocky clunky doesn't work on  
8:02  
this little device you're pretty much  
8:04  
good to go it's pretty hard to mess that  
8:06  
up and if you went and doubt more Whit  
8:08  
space it's a good rule of thumb I don't  
8:10  
know why but that seems to be like the  
8:12  
trend Whit space  
8:14  
everywhere technical  
8:16  
jargon stop it your customer your Target  
8:21  
customer that is going to send you  
8:22  
checks in the mail every single month  
8:26  
does not want to know what an IP  
8:29  
addresses or doesn't want to know that  
8:32  
you are using m.2 drives with 5 gig  
8:36  
download speed and read speeds and write  
8:40  
speed like they don't care about that  
8:43  
easy when I explain to somebody what an  
8:45  
MSP is it's Geek Squad on steroids for  
8:48  
businesses it's as simple as that  
8:50  
everyone in their Grandma can figure  
8:53  
that one out make it simple your Target  
8:57  
customer does not want the technical  
9:00  
jargon if they want the technical jargon  
9:03  
they're going to ask for white papers  
9:05  
with the technical jargon mimo beam  
9:08  
forming technology all the sexy  
9:10  
buzzwords we all  
9:11  
like that's on the back end when they  
9:14  
really want it well what am I  
9:16  
getting all the sexy Jon goes on the  
9:19  
back end your ideal customer does not  
9:21  
know what they're actually getting I  
9:23  
promise you it is our job to explain it  
9:26  
clearly concisely in a format that is  
9:28  
easy to read no calls to action if I  
9:32  
have actually seen this I did I didn't  
9:34  
actually even think this is possible I  
9:36  
have been on websites that don't say  
9:39  
call here learn more contact all there  
9:42  
was was a non-clickable phone  
9:45  
number I feel like at this point in the  
9:48  
video you should take a moment to like  
9:51  
the video  
9:53  
but I just can't believe in  
9:56  
2024 that that story actually exists  
10:00  
it's kind of shocking to me take a  
10:02  
moment hit the like button because  
10:04  
that's an embarrass look it wasn't my  
10:05  
website wasn't your website but like a  
10:08  
button contact something something get a  
10:12  
way to get some information bad mobile  
10:14  
experience I'm sure you could have seen  
10:15  
this one coming from a mile away once  
10:17  
again we don't have to be the Forefront  
10:18  
of mobile it doesn't have to be the  
10:19  
sexiest thing on mobile but it's got to  
10:21  
work on mobile and last but not least if  
10:24  
it takes forever to load you're doing  
10:25  
something wrong you don't need the  
10:27  
highest quality pictures on the face of  
10:28  
this Earth light easy pictures you could  
10:31  
down reses them nobody's looking at your  
10:33  
website on more than like a 24in monitor  
10:37  
it's very rare and even still I have a  
10:39  
49in Ultra wide I don't look at websites  
10:42  
on that the only thing I watch is  
10:43  
YouTube at full or videos at full 32 by  
10:48  
9 I think it is it's Overkill so let's  
10:51  
talk about some websites we've already  
10:53  
we've gone over good stuff that you need  
10:54  
to have bad stuff to avoid let's go into  
10:57  
it so techmd this one came as one of the  
11:00  
highest rated websites and I'm going to  
11:02  
give you my information I like that they  
11:04  
have the payment portal I like that they  
11:05  
have a call now button although I  
11:07  
probably would have made this a bit of a  
11:09  
better button in here or I would have  
11:11  
done a submit a ticket y techmd I like  
11:15  
their little pop out it Services super  
11:17  
simple manag Services right resources  
11:20  
the only thing I probably would include  
11:23  
up here that I don't see is like who we  
11:27  
love to work for if they're working in a  
11:30  
specific Niche I don't know I don't get  
11:32  
the vibe that they are a niche down  
11:34  
company but that's okay love the theme  
11:37  
on here super Sleek super modern learn  
11:39  
more let's see do these all go to  
11:41  
different pages or do they all go to the  
11:42  
same page they all go to different pages  
11:44  
look at  
11:47  
that great job techmd that looks good  
11:50  
it's clean we're Tech experts with over  
11:53  
30 years little hard to read in my  
11:56  
opinion it probably would have gone a  
11:57  
little bit darker back here  
11:59  
um but that's okay I like the awards  
12:02  
client reviews money 26 years in  
12:05  
business  
12:15  
98.02% of people love our  
12:18  
stuff guys go touch grass it's 98 would  
12:24  
have been fine 0.02 come on it's all  
12:28  
right latest tech insights and  
12:30  
intelligence I probably would have just  
12:32  
written blog of some sort in here uh I  
12:35  
also don't like that these aren't all  
12:37  
first initial capitalized but that's  
12:39  
just me uh but it seems pretty congruent  
12:42  
through the whole website I probably  
12:44  
would have also kept like sexy articles  
12:48  
up here and then buried everything else  
12:49  
in the back um your business is our  
12:52  
priority I don't really know if I feel  
12:53  
that but it's a clean nice website y  
12:56  
techmd about us uh this is not clickable  
12:59  
I wish that was I would want to know why  
13:02  
techmd um techmd cares we we'll just zip  
13:06  
through this here makes the difference  
13:09  
why do we care I mean  
13:10  
this for a company that makes me try  
13:13  
tries to make me feel like they care I  
13:15  
just don't know if I believe it on this  
13:18  
page this is not the thing that's  
13:19  
selling me on it but overall I mean  
13:23  
clean first name last name this looks  
13:26  
like a HubSpot form I almost guarantee  
13:28  
it  
13:29  
uh how can we help right how many  
13:30  
employees do you have what services are  
13:31  
you interested in uh not sure about the  
13:34  
best solution for my company that's a  
13:35  
you know a good one I like that they  
13:37  
have this nice um the only other thing  
13:41  
that I they oh they serve a bunch of  
13:42  
different areas so they're they're  
13:44  
pretty much all over the place other  
13:46  
than that I mean I think it's a fairly  
13:48  
good website I wouldn't say it's the  
13:50  
best I've ever seen but I wouldn't say  
13:51  
it's the worst I like that they have  
13:53  
their services broken out modern office  
13:55  
um these are  
13:57  
nice light I mean not much content on  
14:02  
here you know future Managed IT services  
14:05  
future ready for any  
14:07  
challenge I don't know if it sells me on  
14:09  
that as the top thing but something for  
14:14  
food for thought um let's get to the  
14:17  
next one so Frontline manage services  
14:19  
this is another one right off the bat  
14:21  
hard to read this is a nogo I would have  
14:24  
done a white tip or or a white header up  
14:27  
here with black words the Green's fine I  
14:30  
like that it's a little bit of a Punchy  
14:32  
color but I get that that's their colors  
14:34  
I probably wouldn't have gone blue and  
14:36  
green but te their own get in touch out  
14:40  
front every front Frontline manag  
14:43  
Services I mean if you didn't know what  
14:44  
a manage services  
14:47  
was you don't know exactly what you're  
14:49  
looking for or what you're looking  
14:51  
at this this CL this website I think did  
14:56  
a better you know professional IT  
14:57  
company with a personal touch  
14:59  
these I think were better in my opinion  
15:01  
than this I think this is pretty rough  
15:04  
actually um comprehensive man services  
15:07  
for legal okay I like that lot of text  
15:11  
not broken up not a fan Global leader in  
15:13  
law firm  
15:15  
Solutions um super hard to read text big  
15:19  
no no um I do like that it pops in  
15:21  
afterwards it governance um Awards  
15:25  
associations these are good once again I  
15:27  
hard to read  
15:29  
you know you almost have to highlight it  
15:30  
to read it better um strategic Partners  
15:35  
oh this actually links the people that's  
15:37  
cool okay I give them credit for  
15:39  
that I don't know if I would have linked  
15:43  
all these out you're giving a lot of  
15:45  
opportunity to leave the website and  
15:46  
probably not come back um or would have  
15:49  
just written like a little blurb under  
15:51  
each one enabling Technologies Genesis  
15:53  
skill buer IQ  
15:56  
track I don't know exact ly why these  
15:59  
are here I  
16:00  
don't you know I just landed on their  
16:04  
homepage I really would have no idea why  
16:08  
that these are here like Artic Wolf the  
16:11  
leader in Secure security  
16:15  
operations I would hope that you're a  
16:18  
lead dealing with them as a  
16:21  
customer I don't think that this is  
16:23  
great press webinars oh I like the way  
16:25  
this pops out but um image go gray  
16:29  
interesting probably wouldn't have done  
16:31  
that what people say I do like that they  
16:33  
put the testimonials uh stay in touch  
16:35  
subscribe with our newsletter zero  
16:37  
reason why you should subscribe to their  
16:39  
newsletter this is like one of the  
16:41  
highest rated like designs I I got to  
16:44  
say I'm pretty disappointed Mega menu I  
16:46  
don't love the mega menu it's a little  
16:48  
too much  
16:50  
um like ebilling and billing like why  
16:54  
why is that  
16:56  
there we understand benefit  
16:59  
systematic feed  
17:00  
like I feel like unless I really read  
17:03  
every single word this is tough this is  
17:06  
not I was actually expecting I was  
17:08  
hoping for better than this um let's go  
17:11  
insights this is probably a Blog top  
17:13  
five things to consider in the fourth  
17:15  
quarter okay the blog's not bad I  
17:19  
probably would have made them a little  
17:21  
more uniform but not awful I hate this  
17:24  
it goes to gray right off the bat um and  
17:26  
this coloring the person that needs that  
17:29  
did this  
17:30  
coloring hopefully is an employed in  
17:33  
designing websites anymore uh it's super  
17:35  
super hard to read um careers you have  
17:38  
this whole area  
17:41  
wasted I I don't think it's anything  
17:43  
special I actually thought I'd this was  
17:45  
going to be better than what it was um  
17:47  
mvo  
17:49  
marketing not a great one guys uh I hate  
17:52  
to be the guy but uh locations I love  
17:54  
that they have the locations the fact  
17:56  
that they don't have the clickable  
17:57  
locations though that tell you a bit  
17:59  
about the area is crazy and the fact  
18:03  
that these are literally some of these  
18:05  
are London Toronto Cape  
18:07  
Town how how are you doing business in  
18:10  
Cape Town and Washington DC and  
18:13  
Toledo that makes no sense to me I you  
18:16  
know I I would have probably imagined  
18:18  
something that say like a global leader  
18:21  
in it something of that nature um nerds  
18:24  
that care super cool company I didn't  
18:27  
build this website uh I actually happen  
18:28  
to really really like this website I  
18:30  
think it's clear I think it's concise um  
18:32  
if you go back to their home the first  
18:33  
thing that loads is going to be total  
18:35  
support it support that's available 24  
18:37  
hours a day 7 days a week to identify  
18:39  
diagnose and resolve it issues promptly  
18:41  
and efficiently I think it's actually  
18:43  
really really good the owner of the  
18:44  
company James does a really good job and  
18:46  
spends a ton of energy time and money on  
18:49  
the website um compliance cloud services  
18:52  
all like this  
18:54  
it's little  
18:56  
Overkill probably a little Overkill I  
18:58  
would have gone with like maybe six uh  
19:00  
especially if you don't know like what  
19:01  
dark web monitoring is might be a little  
19:04  
much but other than that I think it  
19:05  
looks good I think this looks clean just  
19:07  
a a lot here um and I like that these  
19:09  
are clickable right here I I actually  
19:11  
think that this is really really nice  
19:13  
data backup cloud services network  
19:16  
communications um a big mistake that I  
19:18  
see is Digital Services MSP is providing  
19:21  
it don't it's not worth getting involved  
19:24  
I I could promise you that it's not  
19:25  
worth the money and the headaches that  
19:27  
you you might have to deal with  
19:29  
uh principles of our work quality  
19:31  
Integrity Innovation safety 1 2 3 4  
19:34  
that's cool it looks slightly off center  
19:37  
possibly  
19:39  
um featured case studies uh FTC  
19:43  
guidelines and success story enhancing  
19:45  
head funds like if these are your case  
19:47  
studies I feel like these are like very  
19:50  
Stamped Out I I don't  
19:54  
know uh I don't know how much I like  
19:57  
these personally I would say like  
20:01  
optimizing customer Wi-Fi experience at  
20:02  
a Long Island car  
20:05  
dealership I probably would changed it  
20:07  
and made it a little more click baity  
20:08  
but hey that's that's just me Elite  
20:10  
partner Network I like this it does open  
20:13  
AWS  
20:15  
yeah you could have made a whole page  
20:17  
about your partners and what you do uh  
20:20  
James rocker the founder of the company  
20:22  
and the CEO brilliant team Rich  
20:24  
experience 24/7 support affordable  
20:26  
pricing I probably would have done  
20:27  
support above with the brilliant team  
20:29  
and then experience down below with  
20:30  
affordable pricing personally news  
20:32  
articles and more these guys spend a ton  
20:34  
of effort in branding you can just tell  
20:36  
everything's custom for the most part or  
20:38  
it's modified heavily to look really  
20:40  
really good um cyber security tips of  
20:43  
2024 I will say the the blogs are  
20:47  
usually  
20:48  
pretty bad no way to no nowhere else to  
20:52  
put it  
20:53  
um I don't know how many people are  
20:55  
actually reading these I don't think  
20:57  
that many  
20:58  
uh I I'll cover that in a future video  
21:01  
um they look great but like this is your  
21:03  
time to shine really dive into cyber  
21:05  
security tips to help a small business  
21:08  
um I love this nerd 911 I think it's a  
21:10  
fantastic uh thing overall I think the  
21:13  
look and feel site super clean about us  
21:15  
careers our partners reviews services  
21:18  
like this is nice I like that it pops  
21:20  
out too and you can grab all of these  
21:22  
some case studies we already went over  
21:24  
um I mean pretty straightforward the  
21:26  
only thing that I really that jumps of  
21:28  
me is like not the  
21:30  
best I like the view details I like that  
21:33  
it brings you here there's no way that  
21:35  
if I wanted to sign up for your email  
21:36  
list I could get on your email list  
21:38  
there's literally none there's no way  
21:39  
that I could submit information to learn  
21:42  
more to see why I should work with you  
21:44  
anything like that on here that's just  
21:46  
me third one that came in super highly  
21:48  
rated this is probably the most  
21:51  
appealing one out of all of them I'm not  
21:53  
going to lie there I think that what  
21:55  
they did here is fantastic we provide  
21:57  
your small business was an all-in-one it  
22:00  
Department this is good download the SW  
22:02  
business guide hopefully this brings me  
22:04  
to see it's French no big deal grab my  
22:08  
information like please I want you to  
22:10  
send me stuff I like this this is really  
22:13  
really nice I think it's super super  
22:14  
clean I don't love that I have to scroll  
22:17  
forever like I just get me past this  
22:20  
thing I have that was a lot of wheel  
22:22  
scrolling fast support like this is  
22:26  
cool you don't need this for the whole  
22:28  
website it it's it's a lot right yeah  
22:31  
you could hit this button uh how many  
22:33  
computers I do like that they have this  
22:36  
so let's go 25 and 25 how many servers  
22:39  
let's go two servers here um and it's  
22:42  
2275 per  
22:45  
month not a bad price honestly for what  
22:48  
you're getting uh Office 365 standard I  
22:51  
do like that there's a pricing  
22:52  
calculator though I really do wish more  
22:54  
companies did some kind of pricing uh  
22:57  
calcul calor I think you know minimum 10  
23:00  
computers $150 it's $100 per computer  
23:03  
it's really not that bad uh they do mark  
23:05  
up Office 365 a touch match antivirus  
23:07  
this should be included already like  
23:09  
antivirus is 100% something included I  
23:12  
don't know the other things that's that  
23:14  
could all be extra but antivirus should  
23:16  
be 100% part of um your package get  
23:20  
started with us today I think all this  
23:22  
is pretty decent I like that you can  
23:24  
kind of scroll through this I don't like  
23:25  
the choppiness of it but as far as a  
23:27  
design goes 10 out of 10 once again  
23:30  
nowhere for me to jump on an email list  
23:32  
and last but not least I did have one of  
23:34  
my subscribers reach out and said hey  
23:35  
they want me to review their website so  
23:37  
if you're ready for a basic self-starter  
23:39  
somebody wrote somebody built this  
23:41  
themselves let's get into it so first  
23:43  
things first it looks like there's some  
23:45  
words up here super hard to read the  
23:47  
words um secure right providing best uh  
23:51  
security and peace of mind in today's  
23:53  
increase in cyber threats uh protect  
23:56  
doesn't go anywhere that's okay A little  
23:59  
bit of of an about us and this is keep  
24:01  
in mind this is somebody that solely  
24:02  
built their website um with no  
24:05  
experience at all I this is not awful  
24:09  
right Cloud Solutions we areer you know  
24:11  
our team of experts I would probably put  
24:14  
like relevant pictures in here like a  
24:15  
whole team um I like that it's  
24:17  
comprehensive security but you know the  
24:19  
text that are going to keep the clouds  
24:21  
totally make sense um the coding I get  
24:25  
it happy customers um not bad I would  
24:28  
probably just change the layout like I  
24:29  
actually enjoy the darker theme it just  
24:32  
needs a little bit of tweaking to it um  
24:35  
the lock smiling picture something  
24:38  
doesn't have to be crazy it could just  
24:39  
be one of those cheesy everybody does it  
24:42  
their chest is out they they fold the  
24:44  
arms that would have been fine but hey  
24:46  
look he's one of the only ones contact  
24:48  
us right on the homepage subscribe to  
24:49  
our newsletter uh probably fix your  
24:52  
contact information your socials but as  
24:54  
far as like a pretty quick almost like  
24:56  
one pager  
24:58  
I don't hate it honestly you know it  
25:00  
just needs a it needs a professional  
25:02  
touch to go through portfolio of work my  
25:04  
background that's that's all good I'd  
25:06  
probably write a little bit about you  
25:08  
too successful case studies um it's just  
25:11  
light on content some of the better  
25:13  
websites out there have more content the  
25:15  
more content you have the more writing  
25:16  
the more you can communicate to the  
25:18  
customer what you do and how you do it  
25:19  
but also taking it one step further not  
25:22  
only can you do that but you're going to  
25:23  
start getting more and more traffic to  
25:25  
the website as Google understands what  
25:27  
you do knows what you do and then can  
25:29  
register and send you traffic but  
25:31  
overall I mean for somebody that doesn't  
25:33  
build websites for a living it's not a  
25:35  
bad start it you probably just need to  
25:37  
go through spend a bit more time on it  
25:39  
really clean it up look at some other  
25:42  
people's websites these are some decent  
25:44  
examples of it but have a little fun  
25:46  
with it see who's in your area see what  
25:47  
you like see what you don't like and  
25:49  
then go through but overall the layout  
25:52  
is not bad the importance of cloud uh  
25:54  
Solutions I probably would have written  
25:56  
a good bit more information why the  
25:59  
cloud the benefits of the cloud all that  
26:00  
kind of stuff the fact that it says  
26:02  
woman minut a read I I know being  
26:03  
somebody that's built websites before  
26:05  
that this is the blog area but overall

### **Creating a Rating System for MSP Websites**

### **Objectives:**

- Evaluate key aspects of MSP websites for lead generation, content clarity, and mobile usability.
- Identify strong call-to-action elements and the importance of a customer-centered design.
- Recognize common pitfalls in website design that could detract from user experience.
- Provide examples of highly rated MSP websites, including strengths and areas for improvement.

---

### **Rating Criteria for MSP Websites**

1. **User-Friendliness (Mobile and Desktop)**
    - **Key Points**: Ensure the website is fully responsive across both mobile and desktop platforms. A poor mobile experience could drive away potential leads.
    - **Action**: Regularly test website performance on both desktop and mobile to ensure consistency.
    - **Example**: **TechMD** has a clean and responsive design that performs well on both desktop and mobile devices.
2. **Clear and Concise Content**
    - **Key Points**: The content must be clear, easy to read, and avoid unnecessary jargon. Avoid information overload and cluttered layouts.
    - **Action**: Use tools like ChatGPT to organize information into simple, digestible pages. Keep the focus on client needs.
    - **Example**: **Nerds That Care** uses simple messaging and avoids heavy technical jargon, making the content accessible to all users.
3. **Strong Call to Action (CTA)**
    - **Key Points**: The website should include several strategic CTAs to guide visitors toward contacting the MSP or downloading resources.
    - **Action**: Place CTAs like “Get a Free Consultation” or “Submit a Ticket” on every key section of your website.
    - **Example**: **Frontline Managed Services** has a clear “Get in Touch” button on the homepage, making it easy for visitors to take action.
4. **Customer Testimonials and Case Studies**
    - **Key Points**: Display customer testimonials and case studies prominently to build trust and credibility with potential clients.
    - **Action**: Regularly request reviews from satisfied customers and display these as “Badges of Honor” on your website.
    - **Example**: **TechMD** features detailed client reviews and case studies to showcase past successes.
5. **Highlight Key Services**
    - **Key Points**: Ensure that services offered are presented clearly, with subpages dedicated to explaining each core service in detail.
    - **Action**: Break down your offerings into clear categories and ensure each has a detailed, dedicated page.
    - **Example**: **TechMD** offers well-organized pages for each service, such as managed IT, cybersecurity, and cloud solutions.
6. **Simple and Intuitive Navigation**
    - **Key Points**: Avoid overly complex navigation. Users should be able to find what they need within two or three clicks.
    - **Action**: Review your site’s navigation and streamline any cluttered menus or excessive subpages.
    - **Example**: **Nerds That Care** uses an intuitive menu system that clearly directs visitors to key sections.
7. **Showcase Work Examples**
    - **Key Points**: Include galleries of past work or detailed case studies. If you’ve recabled a server room or set up advanced IT systems, show it off.
    - **Action**: Add a portfolio or gallery section to highlight completed projects.
    - **Example**: **Nerds That Care** effectively showcases their past work in clear, professional galleries.
8. **Secure Website (SSL Certificate)**
    - **Key Points**: Ensure your website is secured with an SSL certificate, providing visitors with confidence in its safety.
    - **Action**: Install an SSL certificate on your website, especially if you’re collecting user information.
    - **Example**: **TechMD** has a secure SSL-enabled website, giving users a sense of trust.
9. **Avoid Outdated Design**
    - **Key Points**: A website that looks old or poorly maintained can damage your credibility. Keep it modern and clean.
    - **Action**: Invest in regular design updates every five to seven years to stay current.
    - **Example**: **Frontline Managed Services** has an outdated design with poor readability. A modern refresh would make it more engaging.
10. **Fast Load Times**
    - **Key Points**: Slow loading times can frustrate users and cause them to abandon the website.
    - **Action**: Use image compression and minimalistic design features to ensure fast load times.
    - **Example**: **TechMD** has a fast-loading website with optimized images that create a smooth browsing experience.

## Transcript

Intro  
0:00  
how do you get more traffic to your  
0:01  
website because more traffic equals more  
0:05  
customers there's a direct correlation  
0:06  
between that not only am I going to be  
0:08  
covering that but I'm also going to be  
0:10  
showing you how to spy on your  
0:12  
competitors so you can see how much  
0:14  
traffic they are actually getting and  
0:16  
even what they're ranking for on Google  
0:18  
my name is Harrison Baron from growth  
0:19  
generators. you've already heard what  
0:21  
we're covering today we help companies  
0:23  
with sales training and marketing before  
0:26  
I get into the material or the content I  
0:28  
should say two quick things one master  
0:30  
class as always down the links below and  
0:32  
two if you haven't joined the free  
0:34  
Discord  
0:35  
yet I don't know what to tell you you're  
0:37  
missing out there's a lot of good  
0:38  
conversations people are growing their  
0:40  
businesses it's the best thing out there  
0:42  
and it is completely free I don't even  
0:44  
ask for an email address to get in there  
0:46  
so let's get into today's content  
0:48  
because there is a ton of stuff that we  
0:50  
have to cover so what is how do you get  
0:54  
actually free traffic now we've already  
0:55  
talked about blog posts and there's a  
0:57  
lot to know about blog posts I'm not  
0:59  
going to lie to you there there's quite  
1:00  
a bit but if you imagine every single  
1:03  
blog post as an opportunity to get more  
1:07  
traffic from Google completely for free  
1:10  
you can then perceive and start to  
1:12  
understand why it's actually important  
1:14  
now I will lay this down as a blanket  
1:17  
statement 99 probably. N9 my math is  
1:21  
might not be 100% correct but based on  
1:23  
what I've seen msps do not write a  
1:26  
single blog post they spend a ton of  
1:29  
money with a marketing company they  
1:31  
build this beautiful sexy nice looking  
1:33  
website and then it just sits there and  
1:37  
nothing gets done I mean it is the  
1:40  
saddest thing in the world your website  
1:42  
is a dynamic Sales Machine and if you're  
1:45  
not using it like that where you're  
1:47  
adding a new content you're building it  
1:49  
you're making it better you're  
1:51  
constantly tweaking and  
1:53  
adjusting it's just not going to perform  
1:55  
now if you've paid for a website you're  
1:57  
already halfway there and if you want to  
1:58  
build it yourself totally cool too that  
2:01  
is the foundation of future success  
2:03  
there's so much to go into it so I'm  
2:06  
going to be sharing my screen here we're  
2:07  
going to be going through some of the  
2:09  
competitors in the world some of what  
2:10  
people are you know this one website I  
2:12  
found on Google has ranked the 20 best  
2:15  
websites for msps but I really want to  
2:17  
break down what they are all not doing  
2:19  
how to cover it and why it's actually  
2:21  
important and I'm actually going to also  
2:22  
include some of a little bonus in there  
2:24  
for you as well so let's jump into my  
CyberOptics  
2:26  
computer here and start getting into it  
2:28  
so cyber optic I don't know who they are  
2:30  
they built this this blog post and I've  
2:32  
already used the first five we've gone  
2:33  
through that already I'm not going to  
2:35  
use the first five I'm going to use the  
2:36  
next handful so right off the bat we got  
2:39  
dedicated it now I've already gone to  
2:41  
their blog and they actually have  
2:42  
blogged but I'm going to start to  
2:44  
critique it now overall an IT service  
2:46  
experience Like No Other Love the  
2:48  
website it's actually quite nice it is  
2:51  
really really beautiful it's well done I  
2:54  
don't particularly love the blue on the  
2:55  
blue a little hard to see the logo but I  
2:57  
totally get it overall great now I  
3:00  
already pre-loaded some of these just to  
3:02  
save myself loading time here and five  
3:04  
ways in MSP can simplify it management  
3:07  
for your Opthalmology practice now hyper  
3:12  
hyper specific somebody would have to be  
3:15  
searching something along the lines of  
3:17  
how to use it to make my Opthalmology  
3:20  
practice better and that's okay there  
3:22  
might be a very small section of the  
3:25  
market who is actually going to look at  
3:26  
that the cool part is when you're so  
3:28  
niched down like that  
3:30  
your target market is actually going to  
3:32  
find it which is  
3:33  
fantastic but big  
3:37  
butt they kind of dropped the ball now  
3:40  
I'm also going to critique too if you're  
3:42  
going to format this make it formatted  
3:44  
correctly like user experience- wise  
3:47  
awful right I like that they have all  
3:49  
these now five ways this could not be  
3:53  
worse manag it system can be an complex  
3:56  
task for Opthalmology practices it often  
3:59  
I mean it's already touching the top  
4:01  
awful experience there's no images in  
4:04  
here right it's very lackluster and  
4:08  
really their five tips there's nothing  
4:10  
like hey here's a secret sauce like this  
4:13  
is actually how you go do this or like  
4:15  
here's a couple different ways like it  
4:17  
really adds if you just reading this and  
4:19  
just it doesn't have to be opthomology  
4:21  
practice you can pretty much copy and  
4:22  
paste this to anybody out there right  
4:25  
consolidate vendor management partnering  
4:27  
with an MSP like this just says hey  
4:29  
where going to do the work for you it  
4:31  
doesn't actually tell you anything about  
4:33  
it instead of of dealing with multiple  
4:36  
vendors and MSP non a One-Stop shop for  
4:39  
all it needs this allows practices to  
4:42  
focus on their core business functions  
4:43  
and leave it management  
4:45  
experience there is so much  
4:50  
missing from that well just consolidate  
4:53  
your vendors and hire us we'll do  
4:55  
everything oh you have a computer hire  
4:57

5:02  
simplify it improve your Security asking  
5:05  
somebody who has no idea about  
5:07  
technology how to improve or give any  
5:10  
advice on how to improve it I feel like  
5:13  
I'm dealing with some of my competitors  
5:15  
there's just no there's there's no  
5:18  
reason anyone would want want would want  
5:21  
to read this increase efficiency now I'm  
5:24  
not bashing on dedicated it they  
5:26  
probably buy it from somebody else  
5:27  
that's besides the point but reduce cost  
5:30  
partnering with an MSP can help  
5:31  
opthomology practices reduce costs by  
5:33  
eliminating the need to hire like this  
5:36  
shows the reader you have zero idea on  
5:41  
what is actually going on in an  
5:44  
Opthalmology practice it's kind of rough  
5:48  
right how Healthcare organizations can f  
5:50

9:11  
about it it's a better article  
9:13  
especially compared to Dedicated it I  
9:16  
mean this this is a world difference  
9:19  
better I whoever's actually going out  
9:21  
and creating this content you can tell  
9:23  
they kind of know what they're doing  
9:24  
like this is great this is a great start  
9:27  
for  
9:28  
any MSP now in the MSP world we are  
9:31  
constantly working on new technologies  
9:32  
I'm going to pull up a third website  
9:34  
here just to show you guys but we're  
9:36  
constantly working on new stuff your  
9:38  
target client you're probably already  
9:40  
working in their environment hopefully  
9:43  
go make content that they would love to  
9:46  
read how to get better how to be more  
9:48  
safe what they can do what they need to  
9:50  
hire out for where things get a little  
9:51  
murky where there's it's better off  
9:53  
getting a professional involved versus a  
9:55  
DIY solution involved like there is so  
9:58  
much opportunity in here red flags for  
10:01  
what to look for like think about it  
10:03  
right we all we all learned back in  
10:05  
school who what where when why and maybe  
10:08  
how if you're not answering all of those  
10:10  
in every single article you're probably  
10:12  
missing the boat and I am vastly  
10:14  
oversimplifying this but the amount of  
10:16  
content that I see that is so thin  
10:19  
there's no benefit in Reading because  
10:22  
it's just chat GPT garbage yes I said it  
10:26  
somebody just got angry with me you  
10:28  
can't chat GPT this you it has to come  
10:31  
from you you can use chat GPT to  
10:33  
leverage it and help you write certain  
10:34  
areas but at the end of the day the  
10:36  
content actually has to come from you so  
10:39  
we did vc3 I'm going to go to uh Medicus  
Medicus  
10:43  
it I don't know I just pulled these up  
10:44  
from from the article here but evaluate  
10:47  
your Healthcare organization with  
10:48  
transform transformational it great um  
10:51  
looks a little crushed in here I'd  
10:53  
probably like to see a little bit more I  
10:54  
like the scans though that's cool I  
10:56  
wonder if they actually did that or  
10:58  
that's from  
11:00  
shutter stock all good beautiful website  
11:02  
simple clean easy I'm a big fan of it  
11:05  
all so let's go to some resources here  
11:07  
what do we got on the blog this is the  
11:09  
most important thing because all of  
11:10  
these Pages do matter but not that much  
11:14  
so we have a little blog post here once  
11:17  
again super super thin unveils  
11:20  
technology okay so this is more of like  
11:22  
a um not a case study but a news  
11:26  
announcement you know mukas it strs in  
11:30  
ECW application supports continuous  
11:32  
transformational Health these are not  
11:35  
really blog posts these are  
11:38  
more like newsletter slash like party  
11:43  
with us where the best at what we do  
11:46  
kinds of things there's no value in here  
11:50  
and if you think about it right every  
11:51  
single website is going to have all of  
11:53  
the content some websites are going to  
11:55  
have more content some websites are  
11:56  
going to have less content but your blog  
11:59  
likes to see or Google likes to see that  
12:01  
you're constantly adding new stuff to  
12:02  
your blog let's do some quick math  
12:05  
believe it or not after I've built about  
12:07  
150 plus websites and that number  
12:08  
consistently grows actually we're  
12:10  
probably closer to 200 plus  
12:12  
now most websites especially for smaller  
12:15  
businesses only have on average between  
12:18  
one and maybe 3,000  
12:22  
words now if you've gone to college  
12:24  
you've probably written a a like a not a  
12:27  
Blog but some kind of  
12:29  
response something like that to a you  
12:32  
you'd have to write a paper in one  
12:33  
regard or another that was probably like  
12:36  
a thousand to 3,000 words most websites  
12:40  
have less believe it or not less than a  
12:42  
thousand most MSP websites typically  
12:44  
have between one and three because they  
12:46  
have Pages for their services that they  
12:48  
actually offer now I'm not saying I'm  
12:52  
the greatest thing since sliced bread I  
12:53  
happen to know SEO extremely extremely  
12:55  
well it's kind of what we did before we  
12:57  
got in the MSP world so I just want to  
12:59  
share with you guys blog posts right and  
13:02  
why they are really really important and  
13:04  
I'm going to actually pull some stuff up  
13:05  
I do like that they have a subscribed to  
13:07  
our blog this is HubSpot all the way I  
13:09  
can I can just tell based on the way it  
13:10  
operates and that's okay like this  
13:13  
company didn't do anything wrong they're  
13:14  
just not creating the opportunity for  
13:16  
Google to send free traffic now you guys  
13:19  
obviously have already seen all this  
13:20  
I've growth generator.com  
13:22  
blog in here bunch of content new blog  
13:25  
post 12 essential Services every MSP  
13:27  
should offer to maximize success good  
13:29  
now currently to be fully transparent we  
13:31  
are writing blog posts to correlate with  
13:34  
our videos as of right now especially  
13:37  
because I'm creating a ton of it but how  
13:38  
much does an MSP cost to start I'll just  
13:41  
use this blog post it's fairly well  
13:44  
written right could it use some tweaks  
13:46  
could it use a little bit more beefing  
13:47  
up of course it could but it covers  
13:50  
quite a bit there's images there's it's  
13:52  
easy to read it fully lays it out it  
13:54  
actually mentions the video in there so  
13:56  
somebody can go through and read that  
13:58  
that's the beautiful part about all this  
14:00  
now this could be significantly longer  
14:02  
and it will grow over time but this is a  
14:05  
well-written blog post properly  
14:07  
structured there's plenty of information  
14:09  
in there so let's get through the  
How to Cheat  
14:10  
nitty-gritty here I've I told you about  
14:12  
the blog post what we were going to be  
14:14  
covering let's look it let's figure out  
14:15  
how to cheat there's a software out  
14:17  
there called Uber suggest in Uber  
14:19  
suggest it's totally free you can go  
14:22  
through and you could actually enter in  
14:24  
somebody else's website now I just  
14:26  
search dedicated it.com so you can go  
14:28  
through R seed and it'll run in real  
14:30  
time and they get 161 organic keywords  
14:33  
with 312 monthly visitors which is  
14:37  
really not many 300 visitors is about 10  
14:40  
per day some of you guys might be  
14:42  
jumping to Joy if you got 10 visitors a  
14:44  
day some of you guys might be pretty  
14:46  
upset they've gotten a thousand  
14:47  
backlinks which tells me they've  
14:48  
probably been around for a while and  
14:50  
they have a domain authority of 20 I'm  
14:52  
going to cover all of this in extreme  
14:54  
detail down the road figure domain  
14:56  
Authority is how much Google trusts you  
14:58  
links are links from other websites back  
15:00  
to you your organic monthly traffic this  
15:03  
is not 100% accurate it's a best guess  
15:05  
and then what they're currently ranking  
15:07  
for about 161 keywords you could see all  
15:09  
of this data but I really just want you  
15:11  
to look and see what they're actually  
15:13  
getting their traffic to homepage  
15:15  
contact us but most of it comes from  
15:16  
their homepage so they might be doing  
15:18  
some kind of advertising something of  
15:20  
that nature I've pulled up vc3 now vc3  
15:23  
has shown that they are making some kind  
15:25  
of steady push to get traffic they're  
15:27  
getting about 8 7,000 is visitors per  
15:30  
month and they've consistently grown  
15:32  
over time which is fantastic they have a  
15:35  
ton of backlinks so they might have some  
15:37  
kind of tool something of that nature  
15:38  
they have a good amount of trust from  
15:40  
Google and they have a ton of organic  
15:41  
keywords and they've put a massive  
15:44  
amount of money behind this if I had to  
15:47  
guess probably in the tens of thousands  
15:49  
of dollars per month to really grow this  
15:51  
sucker out there and third I pulled up U  
15:54  
medus it once again 540 keywords they're  
15:58  
probably just not outing as we've seen  
16:01  
their their stuff is case studies and  
16:04  
news about the company not so much or or  
16:07  
press releases I should say about the  
16:08  
company not so much anything else they  
16:10  
might have had some a nice Spike of a  
16:12  
month but about 1,00 no real consistent  
16:15  
growth domain Authority 34 means Google  
16:17  
kind of trust them and then backlinks  
16:19  
they've been around once again for quite  
16:21  
a while and I pulled up my own stuff  
16:22  
because I am transparent we have been  
16:24  
getting rid of blog posts right we we  
16:27  
used to get about 2700 plus 3,000 we  
16:29  
were actually doing better but we were  
16:31  
trying to trim the fat on our blog and  
16:33  
really make it towards msps and just be  
16:35  
the best resource for msps but as you  
16:37  
can see we dip down a little bit and it  
16:39  
always changes up here and there I can  
16:41  
promise you we do get quite a bit more  
16:42  
than this but this is just what it's  
16:44  
guessing right we actually get about  
16:45  
three to four times this amount that  
16:47  
this shows based on Research that we've  
16:50  
found over this but you could go in  
16:52  
there plug in your competitors see what  
16:53  
they're doing we have about 2500  
16:55  
backlinks we used to write for big  
16:56  
Publications Google trusts this quite a  
16:58  
bit and we do rank for more keywords and  
17:01  
we're constantly working on ranking for  
17:02  
more once again we've made some changes  
17:04  
we're trimming the fat on there but you  
17:06  
can go through and start to see this now  
17:08  
you might be thinking Harrison that was  
17:09  
a great video I'm not done I'm not done  
17:12  
you guys are get it's all about the  
17:13  
value I want to make sure this is a  
17:15  
super helpful video for you guys so I've  
Blog Post Template  
17:18  
already built out a quick little blog  
17:20  
post template now this is only one of  
17:22  
the two pages the second page gives you  
17:24  
a ton more information on how to go  
17:26  
through and get it if you want it it is  
17:28  
down below it's a Word document you can  
17:29  
take this adjust modify it all that good  
17:32  
stuff so how to actually use it we want  
17:35  
to talk about the topic what topic would  
17:37  
our ideal customer absolutely love to  
17:41  
read about how to help their business  
17:42  
how to be more secure with actionable  
17:45  
steps if they are looking to take action  
17:47  
they will if they're looking to find  
17:49  
somebody that knows what they're doing  
17:50  
they will go find them targeted keywords  
17:53  
maybe it is Dental practices in Indiana  
17:57  
or  
17:59  
technology issues in Dental practices in  
18:01  
Indiana just making things up synonym  
18:04  
keywords anything of that nature and  
18:05  
related keywords there's tons of ways  
18:08  
that you could think about what other  
18:10  
keywords might they be searching now  
18:13  
word count goal this is still accurate  
18:16  
but it's becoming less accurate as the  
18:19  
days go on unfortunately with AI there  
18:22  
has been so much to do in there 5 to 700  
18:26  
words is the short side anything over  
18:28  
700 words is okay and then a long post  
18:31  
is about 1,800 to 2200 words these are  
18:34  
very loose metrics you can make it  
18:36  
significantly longer I would highly  
18:38  
advise making it shorter and the best  
18:40  
way to think about this is if you were  
18:42  
to read your article or have your Target  
18:44  
customer read your article I send my  
18:45  
articles out to friends other people in  
18:48  
the industry competitors all that kind  
18:50  
of stuff as often as I possibly can to  
18:52  
get feedback what is this missing what  
18:55  
could be better how what what do you  
18:57  
think this would need to be just an  
19:00  
article that you want to share with your  
19:03  
friends when you have that things get  
19:05  
much easier we want to come up with an  
19:07  
SEO title how to make your dental  
19:12  
practice safer or cyber security safe in  
19:15  
Indiana boom I know it's not a sweet  
19:18  
sexy title but that's what they're  
19:20  
searching come up with some kind of  
19:21  
variations of that your your uh title  
19:24  
should be between 60 and 70 characters  
19:26  
try not to go too much over that it does  
19:29  
kind of penalize you a little bit and  
19:30  
then your meta description what Google  
19:32  
actually shows underneath so if I go to  
19:36  
in here and I search uh it compies  
19:39  
Charlotte as I misspell things this is  
19:42  
your meta description all this under  
19:44  
here top tech companies in Charlotte uh  
19:47  
top information companies in Charlotte  
19:48  
people read this more than you would  
19:50  
think they do and they're clicking on  
19:52  
this this is the title that they're  
19:53  
going to see it's pretty straightforward  
19:56  
internal links what have I already  
19:58  
written that I could link out to other  
20:01  
blog posts products and services Pages  
20:03  
Maybe videos that you want to show and  
20:05  
then headings there's a whole second  
20:06  
page to this if you go down there's a  
20:08  
link down below you can go grab it but  
20:10  
start using this if you're going to  
20:12  
create content for your website think  
20:14  
about creating something that your  
20:16  
target market can actually sit there and  
20:18  
read and get value from and when they do  
20:21  
not just the surface level stuff but  
20:24  
real value when you do this you are  
20:27  
going to get more traffic and more  
20:29  
traffic always means more leads which  
20:32  
always means more customers a broken  
20:35  
clock is right twice a day if you give  
20:37  
the worst salesperson on the planet an  
20:39  
unlimited number of warm leads they will  
20:43  
close them I promise you so create the  
20:46  
content create content that your target  
20:48  
market would love spy on your  
20:50  
competitors get ideas hit Google do the  
20:53  
work I promise you there is so much  
20:55  
opportunity out there on Google because  
20:57  
we already saw it one website made a  
21:01  
halfway decent article there is an  
21:04  
unlimited amount of traffic that you can  
21:06  
get and maybe even traffic that you  
21:08  
can't even go help them maybe they want  
21:10  
to do business with you and you're like  
21:11  
I can't do business with them you could  
21:13  
sell that lead to somebody else or refer  
21:15  
them out and look like a rockstar there  
21:17  
is so much potential on the internet I  
21:20

---

### **2. Blog Strategy: Content Creation Guidelines**

To outperform competitors and drive more traffic to your MSP website, follow this **blogging strategy**:

### **Target Audience Identification:**

Before starting any content, you must clearly define your **buyer persona**:

- **Who**: Small to medium-sized businesses, healthcare practices, or any industry that needs outsourced IT support.
- **What**: They need reliable IT services, cybersecurity protection, cloud solutions, and managed services to reduce downtime and improve efficiency.
- **Pain Points**: They struggle with IT management, cybersecurity, scalability, and cost-effective IT solutions.

### **Content Structure:**

1. **Topic Relevance**: Focus on highly specific topics that directly address your target audience’s needs. For example, instead of writing generic IT content, write industry-specific guides like _"How MSPs Can Help Law Firms Manage Data Security"_.
2. **Keyword Research**: Use tools like **UberSuggest** or **Google Keyword Planner** to find high-value, low-competition keywords related to your services (e.g., "MSP cybersecurity for dental practices"). Ensure to include long-tail keywords that reflect specific search queries.
    - **Main Keywords**: MSP services, managed IT services, cybersecurity for businesses.
    - **Long-Tail Keywords**: How MSPs help reduce downtime, MSP for healthcare practices, best managed IT for small businesses.
3. **Blog Length**:
    - Short-form: 700-1,000 words for quick guides or listicles.
    - Long-form: 1,800-2,200 words for in-depth guides, tutorials, or case studies.
    - Always aim for actionable content. Include real-world examples, tips, and step-by-step processes.

### **Blog Format Best Practices**:

- **Headings & Subheadings**: Use structured headings (H1, H2, H3) for better readability and SEO.
- **Internal Links**: Link to other blog posts, service pages, or case studies to increase time on site and help SEO.
- **External Links**: Reference credible sources to boost the trust factor of your content.
- **Images & Visuals**: Use infographics, diagrams, or screenshots to break up text and engage readers. Optimize images for faster load times.

### **3. Action Plan: Content Creation and Optimization**

### **Week 1-2: Blog Setup**

- **Identify Topics**: Brainstorm 10-15 blog post ideas relevant to MSP services, industry-specific problems, and trending IT topics.
    - Example topics:
        - "How MSPs Can Improve Cybersecurity for Small Businesses"
        - "5 IT Solutions Every Dental Practice Needs"
        - "Cloud Solutions for Law Firms: A Guide to Managed Services"
- **Keyword Research**: Use UberSuggest to identify high-value keywords for each blog post.

### **Week 3-4: Write & Publish Blog Posts**

- **Content Calendar**: Schedule posts bi-weekly to keep content fresh and relevant.
- **SEO Optimization**: Ensure each blog post is optimized for SEO (meta descriptions, alt text for images, headings).
- **Publish**: Aim for at least 1,500 words per post, with engaging content that educates and provides value.

### **Ongoing Strategy:**

- **Track Performance**: Use Google Analytics to track which blog posts drive the most traffic and conversions.
- **Revise & Update**: Refresh older blog posts by adding new information or updating keywords.
- **User Engagement**: Add CTAs (Call-to-Action) in each blog, encouraging visitors to contact your MSP for more information.

### **4. Leveraging Competitor Insights for Better Results**

Use **UberSuggest** to spy on competitors like **VC3**, **Dedicated IT**, and **Medicus IT**:

1. **Identify Competitor Keywords**: Analyze the keywords your competitors rank for and build content targeting similar terms.
2. **Improve on Weak Content**: Look for competitors' blog posts that rank well but offer thin content (as seen in Dedicated IT). Write more comprehensive articles on the same topics, providing better detail and actionable advice.
3. **Backlink Strategy**: Research where your competitors are getting backlinks and aim to get similar or better-quality backlinks by reaching out to relevant websites.

---

### **5. Optimize Pages and Blog Posts for Google**

- **Google Analytics Integration**: Ensure Google Analytics is tracking key metrics for each blog post. Use this data to fine-tune your content strategy.

### **Sample Metrics to Track**:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Metric|Example|
|Page Views|1,000/week|
|Average Session Duration|3 min 45 sec|
|Bounce Rate (%)|35%|
|Conversion Rate (%)|5%|

### **Google PageSpeed Insights**:

Optimize your website for speed and usability. Fast-loading pages rank better in Google and provide a better user experience.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Performance Metric|Mobile Score|Desktop Score|
|Overall PageSpeed Score|85|92|
|First Contentful Paint|2.2s|1.8s|
|Time to Interactive|3.4s|2.5s|

---

### **6. Actionable Blogging Tips to Drive MSP Sales**

1. **Create Industry-Specific Case Studies**: Showcase how your MSP services solved particular issues in industries like healthcare, legal, or education.
2. **Target Local SEO**: Write location-based blog posts (e.g., _"Best MSP Services in Sydney"_) to capture local business leads.
3. **Offer Free Resources**: Create downloadable guides (e.g., _"How to Choose an MSP for Your Small Business"_) to capture leads via email signups.

By following this structured approach, your MSP website can generate free organic traffic, build credibility, and ultimately convert more visitors into paying customers.

1:13  
link down below so let's get into search  
1:16  
engine optimization I want to talk about  
1:17  
exactly what it is first because I feel  
1:19  
like a lot of people they they it's a  
1:21  
buzzword right like WAP Lan all that  
1:24  
good stuff but in this case it's SEO  
1:27  
search engine optimization is making  
1:29  
your website  
1:30  
look like a juicy steak to Google a very  
1:33  
hungry dog Google believe it or not  
1:35  
really wants to send you traffic It's  
1:37  
actually kind of insane they're always  
1:39  
looking to find new websites or just  
1:42  
websites to best give to the Searcher

1:47  
searching for I don't know best it  
1:50  
companies in Charlotte or best MSP in  
1:51  
Charlotte it's kind of insane but as you  
1:54  
progressively go you're going to realize  
1:56  
that more website visitors means more  
1:59  
leads which means more deals more  
2:02  
customers and ultimately more in this  
2:05  
case fake movie prop money in your  
2:07  
pocket but that's really the whole point  
2:08  
of this is to put real money in your  
2:10  
pocket so that's really what search  
2:13  
engine optimization is it's that's  
2:15  
really the whole thing but what what is  
2:17  
it why is it important for your MSP well  
2:20  
one it helps tremendously with  
2:22  
visibility and brand awareness and I  
2:25  
want to pull up my screen here because  
2:26  
or my computer here because it's  
2:28  
actually kind of important for you to  
2:30  
fully understand so I just searched  
2:31  
really quick it companies in Charlotte  
2:34  
North Carolina now the first half always  
2:36  
sponsored Google's this is actually kind  
2:38  
of crazy that they're having four and I  
2:41  
I think I've seen five sponsored ads  
2:43  
it's Google you got to tone it down a  
2:45  
little bit all right too many  
2:46  
sponsorships but down below we have  
2:48  
talked top tech companies learn about 20  
2:51  
tech companies top information these are  
2:54  
blogs they're not really the actual MSP  
2:56  
so somebody going through that they  
2:57  
might find what they're looking for we  
2:59  
have the the map pack which is all of  
3:01  
the uh msps in the area or it companies  
3:05  
which with their you know websites  
3:07  
directions all that but then as we  
3:09  
scroll down we actually land on one  
3:11  
company which is complete Network now in  
3:13  
all transparency I pre-loaded it just to  
3:15  
make uh life easier and I also loaded up  
3:17  
built-in which is just above them it's  
3:20  
not actually a blog post it's just  
3:22  
talking about other websites where  
3:23  
somebody really might not find this  
3:25  
valuable right who especially somebody  
3:26  
doesn't want to do that much research so  
3:28  
complete Networks this is the page that  
3:30  
you land on Charlotte IT company I'm  
3:32  
doing Charlotte cuz I'm over in  
3:33  
Charlotte prioritize course business  
3:35  
functions they have a a HubSpot form  
3:38  
here big fan all good they have some  
3:40  
testimonials this is exactly what you  
3:42  
should expect when you see a a specific  
3:45  
area now they are based in Charlotte but  
3:48  
they also have a couple other branches  
3:49  
Albany bluffington Savannah all good  
3:52  
this is currently what they have now how  
3:55  
do we actually get there right because  
3:56  
it's giving them a massive Competitive  
3:59  
Edge which is is Number Two by doing SEO  
4:01  
believe it or not you're going to get a  
4:03  
huge Competitive Edge against your  
4:05  
competition you're going to get found  
4:07  
more on Google when they're searching  
4:09  
for your competition if you do a good  
4:10  
job with search engine optimization  
4:12  
there's a high probability you're  
4:14  
probably going to show up on the search  
4:16  
page when your Target customer is  
4:18  
looking for a potential candidate so  
4:20  
you're getting a huge Competitive Edge  
4:22  
the further you go up through Google  
4:24  
which is what we all want and then on  
4:26  
top of that more traffic allows you to  
4:28  
build more leads work on your  
4:31  
conversions and overall optimize it  
4:33  
which is the best part It ultimately  
4:34  
puts the green stuff in your pocket  
4:38  
movie theater money don't forget it I'm  
4:39  
not one of those fake influencers so  
4:41  
let's talk about some strategies that  
4:43  
you need to go through because I've  
4:44  
covered quite a bit here the first is  
4:46  
keyword research and the second one is  
4:48  
going to be optimizing your website now  
4:51  
ultimately these mean two things but  
4:54  
it's it's just about your perfect  
4:57  
customer and I if you've already seen it  
4:59  
I mean I've pulled it up but you have to  
5:01  
get a buyer Persona this buyer Persona I  
5:03  
I can't stress enough a lot of msps like  
5:05  
I don't use a buyer Persona there's not  
5:07  
I it's I'm in a too small of an area I  
5:09  
promise you it's okay you can have more  
5:11  
than one buyer Persona there's no law  
5:13  
that says you can you can make your  
5:16  
website for two or three different kinds  
5:17  
of customers but don't make it for every  
5:20  
single potential customer that's the  
5:21  
difference you want to go through take  
5:23  
some time first name last name pretend  
5:25  
this is your dream customer who is going  
5:28  
to put this in your pocket that's really  
5:31  
the goal is putting us in your pocket so  
5:33  
if you can figure out who your buyer  
5:35  
Persona is everything just got  
5:38  
tremendously easier right psychographics  
5:40  
their Hobbies activities values what  
5:42  
they really care about the goals of  
5:44  
their business behaviors and habits that  
5:46  
they have the second page like I said go  
5:48  
grab it down below but really knowing  
5:50  
who that person is is going to make you  
5:52  
think okay if they were searching on  
5:55  
Google just like I have what would they  
5:57  
actually search is it it it support for  
6:00  
dental firms or it support Dental firms  
6:03  
in Charlotte is it it support for  
6:06  
accounting firm Charlotte it support for  
6:08  
in Calgary uh Canada I believe it's  
6:11  
place in Canada I'm just making up  
6:12  
ridiculous words just kidding you know  
6:14  
Miami is it is it San Bernardino Texas  
6:19  
like it doesn't particularly matter it  
6:21  
it really  
6:22  
doesn't just creating and thinking about  
6:25  
what your Target customer is searching  
6:28  
online you might even be in a place that  
6:31  
has a special name that nobody has ever  
6:33  
heard of before for example I live a  
6:36  
part of Gastonia which is a county next  
6:39  
to Charlotte just to the west of  
6:41  
Charlotte you might say like it  
6:44  
companies in the gas house that's just  
6:46  
one of their names I don't particularly  
6:48  
understand why but I I was not born and  
6:50  
raised here there's there's like these  
6:52  
kind of slang terms and names that you  
6:54  
might be able to even use to weed out  
6:57  
who's local and who's not local but you  
6:59  
being an expert knowing who your Target  
7:00  
customer is you can go back and say Hey  
7:03  
you know it company in gtown or or the  
7:06  
gas house charl you know Charlotte or or  
7:08  
North Carolina boom and now you're going  
7:10  
to actually rank for that understanding  
7:13  
who you're and what your client is  
7:15  
thinking is the most important thing  
7:18  
with SEO it's going to help you with  
7:20  
developing your local SEO as they search  
7:22  
locally but it's also going to help you  
7:24  
build specialized SEO where maybe you  
7:26  
Niche down for dental offices marketing  
7:29  
companies you could even do  
7:31  
manufacturing firms entertainment  
7:33  
companies like the list realistically  
7:34  
goes on and on and on and as time  
7:38  
progresses and as you build this up  
7:40  
you're going to develop these things  
7:41  
called backlinks think of backlinks as a  
7:45  
vote of trust from one website to  
7:47  
another that's really it at the core of  
7:49  
it it's a link and and we all know what  
7:51  
links are it's just a link on somebody's  
7:52  
else's website back to your website it's  
7:56  
that simple it's a vote of trust that  
7:58  
Google looks at and the the more  
8:00  
authoritative that company is let's say  
8:02  
it's Warren Buffett and Warren Buffett's  
8:03  
giving out you know Financial advice  
8:06  
versus a kid that just graduated talking  
8:09  
about I don't know Bitcoins from high  
8:12  
school it's very very different between  
8:15  
those two so Google looks at as Warren  
8:18  
Buffett he's got a long track record  
8:20  
versus Kid that just got out of high  
8:22  
school lot more trust built up in that  
8:25  
so now that we've kind of covered your  
8:27  
backlinks building authority ranking  
8:29  
higher in Google getting more potential  
8:31  
leads that's all well and good now let's  
8:33  
talk about three common mistakes that  
8:35  
people typically make in SEO number one  
8:39  
is they're using super outdated  
8:41  
techniques when I say super  
8:43  
outdated rewind 10 or 15 years ago back  
8:46  
to the 2000s to 2010s SEO was super easy  
8:50  
it was kind of like the inside crowd if  
8:52  
you knew what you were doing you could  
8:53  
make anybody kill it on Google it was  
8:56  
like printing money essentially UNT  
8:59  
fortunately those days have now gone but  
9:01  
people are still implementing those  
9:03  
strategies and techniques the number one  
9:05  
worst thing that you can do is use super  
9:08  
old techniques they're going to  
9:09  
ultimately harm your website so whoever  
9:11  
you're working with or if you're doing  
9:13  
yourself make sure the videos you're  
9:14  
watching or the education you're getting  
9:16  
or if you're watching this channel  
9:17  
you're good is not from 10 or 15 years  
9:20  
ago you want the updated ideas thoughts  
9:23  
how to do it execution techniques all  
9:25  
that good stuff at a more relevant time  
9:28  
frame than the olden days two do not I  
9:33  
can't if there's one thing you take away  
9:35  
from this video other than hitting that  
9:37  
like button right now and hitting that  
9:38  
subscribe button notification is please  
9:42  
don't forget about these people right  
9:45  
what I what I mean by these people is  
9:46  
not iPhone users I don't care if you use  
9:48  
iPhone or Android I'm I'm slightly  
9:50  
company agnostic but the people that are  
9:52  
always on their phone looking at it and  
9:54  
scrolling through their phone all the  
9:55  
time this is really important it is so  
9:59  
common for us to forget about the people  
10:01  
that use their phones for just about  
10:03  
everything more search traffic happens  
10:06  
in this little device than any other  
10:08  
desktop make sure your website's mobile  
10:10  
friendly and everything you do is mobile  
10:12  
friendly it'll make your life a million  
10:14  
times easier and it'll drastically  
10:17  
Skyrocket your success especially in the  
10:18  
space versus the people that just  
10:20  
completely forget about  
10:22  
them it's so crazy common and number  
10:25  
three is look at your analytics you have  
10:27  
Google Analytics and then you also have  
10:29  
Google search console if you don't know  
10:31  
either one of those don't worry I got  
10:32  
you I'm working on a super secret  
10:34  
project there's also videos coming in  
10:35  
the future about all of that stuff  
10:37  
specifically for msps don't forget about  
10:40  
your analytics you don't have to watch  
10:42  
them every day but pop in there every  
10:44  
week or so look at them figure out what  
10:46  
you could do better it's only going to  
10:48  
help you over and over and over again  
10:51  
those are so it is even I forget  
10:53  
sometimes I just looked at my analytics  
10:55  
I'm like they could be better I need to  
10:58  
spend a little more time on it but I've  
10:59  
been doing a lot of YouTube right and my  
11:00  
team is still working on some things we  
11:02  
did a major cut over a lot of cool stuff  
11:03  
happening but don't forget about them it  
11:06  
is really important if you're not  
11:07  
tracking you're not measuring you're not  
11:09  
looking at the data you are opening up a  
11:12  
potential can of worms or just things  
11:13  
are going to get neglected if I'm being  
11:15  
totally honest with you don't let it  
11:17  
happen track the data pop in there once  
11:20  
a week or once every other week put it  
11:22  
on your calendar you only have to look  
11:23  
at it for 15 20 minutes just understand  
11:25  
what's going on with the data with the  
11:27  
information that you could possibly get  
11:29  
and then make some adjustments from  
11:31  
there they're super common mistakes and  
11:34  
by doing the opposite of everything I  
11:36  
just said you are going to kill it I  
11:38  
promise you that one so that's why Ms  
11:41  
why MSP is really important SEO why SEO  
11:43  
is really important to msps I've had a

## SEO Plan

### **Invisible to Invincible: SEO Mastery for Managed Service Providers**

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is not just a buzzword; it’s a critical tool for growing your Managed Service Provider (MSP) business by driving more traffic to your website, generating leads, and ultimately converting those leads into customers. In this section, we will break down how you can master SEO, from keyword research to leveraging analytics, to elevate your online presence and become invincible in search engine rankings.

### **1. Keyword Research: Finding the Right Words for Your Audience**

### **Action Plan:**

1. **Understand Your Buyer Persona**:
    - Develop specific buyer personas for your MSP business, including industry types (e.g., dental firms, legal offices), geographic location (e.g., Charlotte, NC), and pain points (e.g., cybersecurity, IT management).
    - Each persona will help you target specific keywords that your ideal customer is searching for.
2. **Keyword Tools**:
    - Use tools like **Google Keyword Planner**, **UberSuggest**, or **Ahrefs** to identify high-value, low-competition keywords. Look for search terms like:
        - _IT services for dental practices_
        - _Managed IT solutions in [city]_
        - _Best MSP in Charlotte_
3. **Long-Tail Keywords**:
    - Optimize for long-tail keywords such as _cybersecurity services for healthcare businesses in [city]_. These have lower competition and higher conversion potential.
4. **Local Keywords**:
    - Incorporate local SEO keywords like _IT support in [city]_, _MSP near me_, or _best IT services for small businesses in [city]_.

---

### **2. On-Page SEO: Structuring Your Content for Google**

### **Action Plan:**

1. **Title Tags and Meta Descriptions**:
    - Ensure every page has a title tag (60 characters max) and a compelling meta description (up to 155 characters) that includes your target keywords.
2. **Content Optimization**:
    - Aim for a minimum of 700-1,000 words for blog posts and 1,500-2,200 words for service pages. Optimize headings (H1, H2, H3) to break down the content and use keywords naturally.
    - Include **internal links** to your other blog posts and **external links** to authoritative sources to enhance credibility.
3. **Mobile-Friendly Design**:
    - Given that more searches are performed on mobile devices than desktops, ensure your website is fully mobile-responsive. Google prioritizes mobile-friendly websites in its search rankings.
4. **Images & Visuals**:
    - Optimize all images by reducing file size for faster load times and including alt text with relevant keywords.

---

### **3. Local SEO: Dominating Your Local Market**

### **Action Plan:**

1. **Google My Business**:
    - Claim and optimize your **Google My Business** listing. Ensure your NAP (Name, Address, Phone Number) is consistent across all platforms.
    - Include local keywords in your listing (e.g., _Managed IT Services in Charlotte_).
2. **Local Content**:
    - Create content around local events, business challenges, or industry-specific IT needs in your area (e.g., _Top Cybersecurity Challenges for Charlotte Businesses_).
3. **Local Directories**:
    - Get listed in local directories such as Yelp, Yellow Pages, and industry-specific directories to build citations and backlinks.
4. **Reviews & Testimonials**:
    - Encourage satisfied clients to leave positive reviews on Google. Reviews are a key ranking factor for local SEO.

---

### **4. Technical SEO: Enhancing Your Website Performance**

### **Action Plan:**

1. **Page Speed Optimization**:
    - Use tools like **Google PageSpeed Insights** to check and improve load times. Target a load time under 3 seconds for optimal performance.
2. **Secure Your Site with HTTPS**:
    - Ensure your website is secured with an SSL certificate. Google prioritizes HTTPS-secured websites.
3. **Sitemap & Indexing**:
    - Submit an XML sitemap to **Google Search Console** to make it easier for Google to crawl and index your website.
4. **Mobile Optimization**:
    - Ensure that your website design is optimized for mobile devices, as mobile traffic continues to increase.

---

### **5. Content Marketing: Fueling Your SEO Engine with High-Quality Content**

### **Action Plan:**

1. **Blog Regularly**:
    - Post at least 2-4 blogs per month. Focus on industry-specific content like _How Managed IT Services Can Reduce Downtime for Manufacturing Companies_ or _Top IT Solutions for Law Firms_.
2. **Internal Linking**:
    - Link relevant blog posts to your service pages. For example, if you have a blog about _Cybersecurity Trends in 2024_, link it to your cybersecurity service page.
3. **Guest Blogging**:
    - Write guest posts for industry-related websites to build backlinks. This will help boost your domain authority and drive more organic traffic.

---

### **6. Off-Page SEO: Building Trust with Backlinks**

### **Action Plan:**

1. **Backlink Strategy**:
    - Aim to acquire high-quality backlinks by guest posting on reputable sites, creating shareable content, and reaching out to partners for cross-promotion.
2. **Social Sharing**:
    - Promote your content across social media platforms to increase visibility and encourage backlinks from other authoritative sites.
3. **Broken Link Building**:
    - Use tools like **Ahrefs** to find broken links on other sites. Reach out to site owners and suggest your content as a replacement.

---

### **7. Tracking & Analytics: Monitoring SEO Performance**

### **Action Plan:**

1. **Google Analytics**:
    - Set up **Google Analytics** to track key metrics such as page views, bounce rates, and conversions. Review this data weekly to monitor progress.
2. **Google Search Console**:
    - Use **Google Search Console** to monitor your site’s performance in Google’s search results. Identify keywords that are driving traffic and adjust your strategy accordingly.
3. **Regular Audits**:
    - Conduct quarterly SEO audits to ensure your site is fully optimized. Look for issues such as broken links, duplicate content, and slow-loading pages.

0:47

0:49  
a real company and there's a lot of  
0:50  
things that most people miss so let's  
0:53  
jump into LinkedIn here and I'm going to  
0:55  
show you exactly what I am talking about  
0:57  
now if you've already made your LinkedIn  
0:59  
fantastic you are significantly further  
1:01  
ahead of most people but in here you  
1:05  
want to go through and you'll see four  
1:07  
business now home is going to be  
1:08  
everything for home that's just kind of  
1:10  
your personal homepage just like your  
1:12  
Facebook news feed but in here for  
1:14  
business you're going to go through and  
1:16  
create a company page now in this case  
1:19  
it's going to be a company not an  
1:21  
educational institute not a showcase  
1:22  
page there are plenty of videos for that  
1:24  
you're going to click company and you're  
1:26  
going to fill out all of this  
1:28  
information to the best of your your  
1:30  
ability that's really it it's going to  
1:32  
mandate you and as you go through and  
1:34  
you hit create page it'll tell you what  
1:36  
is required and what is not required and  
1:38  
the more information you add here it'll  
1:40  
actually show up as a page preview of  
1:42  
what you're actually creating this  
1:44  
shouldn't take more than the better part  
1:45  
of 5 or 10 minutes and just keep in mind  
1:48  
300 pixels x 300 pixels a square that's  
1:51  
what they're looking for specifically if  
1:53  
it's a little bit bigger it hasn't ever  
1:54  
yelled at me but linkedin's LinkedIn and  
1:56  
they might change things now if you've  
1:58  
already made your company LinkedIn page  
1:59  
I'm going to show you how to get there  
2:01  
you can go to home my pages and you'll  
2:03  
see your LinkedIn page now your page is  
2:07  
separate from your personal think of it  
2:10  
as two different entities you are your  
2:13  
business page I'm going to stop sharing  
2:14  
here for a second but your business page  
2:17  
is kind of the umbrella and you exist  
2:19  
underneath that you are your own entity  
2:22  
outside of that but in the company world  
2:25  
or the company page you exist underneath  
2:28  
that umbrella so if you go through  
2:30  
whoops if you go through here you'll be  
2:31  
able to actually see your page now when  
2:34  
you're just starting out you're going to  
2:35  
see kind of a thermometer bar almost and  
2:38  
it has little sections to tell you what  
2:41  
to actually go through but that is  
2:43  
boring and not the most exciting so I'm  
2:45  
going to give you guys some tips tricks  
2:47  
and how to actually go about this so you  
2:49  
can get the best data possible before  
2:52  
you do anything on here you want to go  
2:55  
through and hit edit page and settings  
2:57  
you want to make sure that you go  
2:58  
through as much of this this as possible  
3:00  
now I'm going to open these up in kind  
3:02  
of separate little tabs so you can  
3:03  
actually see them we'll give them a  
3:05  
second to load here but you want to make  
3:07  
sure you go through all of these as  
3:10  
silly as it might sound there's tons of  
3:12  
information in here you want to manage  
3:14  
your admins manage restricted members  
3:16  
manag your following this is down in  
3:17  
settings chat box or inbox settings job  
3:20  
postings and if you need to deactivate  
3:22  
your page that's going to be located in  
3:24  
settings next is going to be your actual  
3:27  
page information now some of this is  
3:29  
going to be the exact same as what you  
3:31  
just put in when you created the page  
3:33  
and that's fine this is where you can go  
3:35  
a bit deeper you want to go through and  
3:37  
talk a little bit about your business  
3:40  
mine probably needs to be updated a  
3:41  
little bit and you could just take this  
3:43  
go into chat GPT hey chat I would like  
3:45  
to work on this and chat will tell you  
3:48  
CH you can say chat ask me 10 or 15  
3:50  
questions about my business respond with  
3:53  
those 10 or 15 answers and say hey it  
3:55  
has to be within  
3:57  
2,000 characters and it'll spit that out  
4:00  
for you that's the beautiful part about  
4:02  
this you want to go through and fill out  
4:04  
this as to the best of your ability the  
4:07  
more you fill this out the more  
4:09  
visibility LinkedIn is going to give you  
4:12  
that's why you have to do this it's  
4:14  
nothing more than that they want a  
4:16  
updated and accurate database and you  
4:18  
want exposure that's the tradeoff there  
4:21  
and you're going to go through Page  
4:23  
information they're always going to be  
4:24  
trying to get you to go premium you do  
4:26  
not need to go premium unless you plan  
4:28  
on using it to make  
4:30  
additional Revenue when I say that I  
4:32  
mean using it for prospecting using it  
4:34  
to Target specific businesses that's  
4:36  
when you need to do it if you're  
4:37  
watching this video and you're just  
4:39  
setting it up more than likely you don't  
4:41  
need it on day one the button that you  
4:43  
want to have visit website the featured  
4:45  
area it'll show you the featured area  
4:48  
about overview interested talents if  
4:50  
there's anything in there this is  
4:51  
obviously for recruiters workplace right  
4:54  
workplace module you're going to go  
4:56  
through and grab as much information and  
4:58  
update as much much information in this  
5:01  
entire section as possible it's not very  
5:04  
exciting it's not very adrenaline  
5:06  
pumping but that's how it goes now after  
5:09  
you do all of that there's a couple  
5:11  
things that you're going to want to do  
5:12  
you're going to want to start making a  
5:14  
couple posts you want to hit it back to  
5:16  
back to back you don't want to leave  
5:19  
time in between and you want to post  
5:21  
directly on the platform now I KN do  
5:23  
need to take a dose of my own medicine I  
5:25  
don't post directly on LinkedIn because  
5:28  
my videos are almost exclusively longer  
5:31  
than 10 minutes so it is nearly  
5:33  
impossible you have to have a less than  
5:35  
10 minute long video to post it on  
5:38  
LinkedIn so if you do great if you don't  
5:40  
you're going to need to share it out  
5:41  
from some other area it'll tell you  
5:43  
there'll be ads in your own feed right  
5:45  
post the job free job and they'll  
5:47  
they'll they want you to start using it  
5:49  
and you want to post these rather  
5:51  
quickly at least three doesn't have to  
5:54  
be all in the same day it can be all in  
5:56  
the same day but you want to show some  
5:57  
kind of activity people only scroll down  
6:00  
three or four times when it starts to  
6:01  
load here that's typically it and this  
6:03  
is four posts right before it starts  
6:06  
asking or loading more posts now once  
6:09  
again this is all my own YouTube stuff  
6:11  
and you could go through they're going  
6:12  
to want to sell you stuff after you do  
6:16  
all of this you can go up here you're  
6:18  
going to have a  
6:19  
little uh like pencil I guess you want  
6:22  
to upload a cover image 1128 by 191  
6:26  
pixels it is a very thin horiz Al image  
6:30  
that's what they're looking for it's  
6:32  
going to ask you to adjust it or  
6:33  
anything like that and then you'll have  
6:34  
your company logo that you already added  
6:36  
in the edit page or when you created it  
6:38  
now after all of this is done there's  
6:42  
only a couple things left that you're  
6:44  
going to want to do every single month  
6:46  
LinkedIn allows you to invite  
6:48  
250 people if you haven't already start  
6:52  
connecting with your Target customer on  
6:56  
LinkedIn update your personal LinkedIn  
6:59  
go through that process it's very very  
7:01  
similar to this you'll go through that  
7:03  
and I'll actually show you that in a  
7:04  
future video but after you do that you  
7:06  
want to go through and you actually want  
7:08  
to invite as many connections as  
7:10  
possible  
7:12  
specifically in your target market right  
7:15  
so in here it's going to say location  
7:16  
current company schools it's going to  
7:18  
give you a little uh little more in here  
7:20  
search by name right you have your  
7:22  
school and then your industry you can  
7:24  
search in this case I would search IT  
7:26  
services and IT consulting technology  
7:29  
and information internet right and maybe  
7:31  
technology information media but I'm  
7:32  
just going to go with these two now if  
7:34  
it's if they're already invited there  
7:36  
won't be a little square here to invite  
7:39  
them to to select it right but Jack  
7:42  
Lions right he has a little square you  
7:44  
can go through and you'll see I've  
7:45  
already invited a ton of people not  
7:47  
everybody uses this platform every day  
7:49  
not everybody uses this platform every  
7:51  
single month but it'll refresh every  
7:54  
single month and anytime somebody  
7:56  
accepts the invite to follow you  
7:58  
actually get another in invite credit  
8:00  
because it shows LinkedIn hey there's a  
8:01  
lot of people that really want to you  
8:03  
know see this content in this case I've  
8:05  
invited a ton of people already but  
8:08  
every once in a while you can see a  
8:09  
little square that you can uh invite  
8:11  
more and more people uh to like your  
8:14  
business page otherwise you can go  
8:17  
through here any additional information  
8:19  
schools if you want to Target friends in  
8:20  
that school or other people like that  
8:23  
you can go through and you can start to  
8:24  
see now we're starting to get some some  
8:26  
squares to invite those people all you  
8:28  
simply do is Click  
8:29  
the check mark you can send the invite  
8:32  
and then it'll say you know create a  
8:34  
post right they want you to make more  
8:36  
posts they want you to be active on the  
8:38  
platform after that it'll actually tell  
8:41  
you right sending each invitation  
8:42  
requires one credit right returned each  
8:44  
month it tells you everything that I  
8:46  
just told you but the other cool part is  
8:48  
as you you select it it'll say credit  
8:51  
refill June 1st so every single month  
8:54  
it'll just reset to those 250 now you  
8:57  
can't add 250 people to your personal  
9:00  
LinkedIn every single month sometimes  
9:03  
you can depending on who's connecting  
9:05  
usually you're limited to just over a  
9:07  
100 people they haven't publicly said  
9:09  
the number people have kind of figured  
9:10  
that one out but after that you want to  
9:13  
make regular posts and then and only  
9:17  
then you want to look at your analytics  
9:19  
now your analytics are going to change  
9:20  
over time the more you post regularly on  
9:23  
the platform but you'll actually be able  
9:24  
to see the content that you're you're  
9:26  
posting right the engagement the views  
9:29  
all of that the Impressions that you're  
9:30  
going to get on here the visitors who's  
9:33  
visiting your profile now they're going  
9:34  
to they want you right this page uh  
9:37  
pages that post at least once a week see  
9:39  
five times more followers of course they  
9:41  
do right they want you to get as much  
9:44  
information on there they want you to  
9:46  
pay for credits everywhere you'll see  
9:48

# MSP email Marketing

### Detailed Review and Summary:

The video provides a comprehensive overview of the steps and strategies for effective cold emailing as a Managed Service Provider (MSP). It emphasizes the importance of preparation, precision, and adherence to a structured process to maximize results. Below is a detailed review of the key elements covered:

1. **Understanding Cold Emailing**:
    - Cold emailing involves sending emails to potential clients without any prior interaction. The goal is to convert these recipients into leads.
    - It differs from warm emailing, where there’s a pre-existing connection, such as meeting at a networking event.
2. **Importance of Targeting**:
    - A successful cold email strategy starts with knowing your target audience. Understanding the ideal customer profile and their pain points is essential.
    - Harrison suggests using a buyer persona template to define the target audience accurately.
3. **Building an Email List**:
    - The key to successful cold emailing is obtaining accurate, verified contact information, including name, email, and company.
    - Recommended tools for building lists include Lead Scrape and Apollo. These tools help gather contact information efficiently.
    - Verification is necessary to avoid the risks of sending emails to invalid addresses, which can lead to being flagged as spam.
4. **Email Verification**:
    - Using an email verification tool (e.g., Kickbox) is crucial to ensure deliverability and to maintain the sender’s reputation.
    - If more than 5-7% of the emails bounce back, it can lead to being marked as spam.
5. **Programs for Cold Emailing**:
    - The video mentions three key programs: Apollo, Instantly, and Lemlist.
    - These tools help automate the sending process while maintaining personalization, making emails look more like they are coming from an individual rather than a mass marketing campaign.
    - **Warm-up**: Before sending emails, it’s essential to "warm up" the new email domain to avoid spam filters. This process is built into these tools.
6. **Email Content**:
    - Writing effective cold emails requires addressing the recipient’s pain points and offering solutions tailored to their needs.
    - Using AI tools like ChatGPT can help generate content but should be used as a starting point, with manual adjustments to improve relevance and personalization.
    - Multiple follow-up emails should be part of the strategy rather than relying on a single email to get results.
7. **Website Alignment**:
    - The website must support the message conveyed in the emails. If potential leads visit the website, it should effectively address the same pain points and solutions highlighted in the emails.
    - A cohesive digital presence ensures that interested recipients do not lose confidence when researching the MSP’s services online.

### Email Marketing Plan for MSP:

1. **Identify Target Audience**:
    - Use a detailed buyer persona to define your target clients, including their business size, industry, and key challenges.
2. **Build a Targeted Email List**:
    - Utilize tools like **Lead Scrape** and **Apollo**:
        - **Lead Scrape** ([Lead Scrape](https://leadscrape.com/)): Effective for extracting business contact details across various industries. Highly recommended for building targeted lists.
        - **Apollo** ([Apollo](https://www.apollo.io/)): Also offers lead generation, but with added CRM functionalities. It integrates well with other marketing platforms.
    - Effectiveness: Both tools are rated high for building reliable lists, but using both together can expand reach.
3. **Email Verification**:
    - Use a service like **Kickbox** ([Kickbox](https://kickbox.com/)): Ensures all contacts are valid, reducing bounce rates.
    - Effectiveness: Essential for maintaining deliverability and avoiding spam blacklists.
4. **Set Up a Separate Email Domain**:
    - Create a dedicated domain for cold emailing (e.g., outreach.venttech.com.au). This minimizes the risk to your primary domain's reputation if issues arise.
    - Warm up the domain before sending bulk emails to improve trust with email servers.
5. **Write Effective Emails**:
    - Structure emails around the identified pain points of your target audience.
    - Utilize **ChatGPT** to draft personalized, relevant content quickly. Ensure to edit and tailor the content manually for maximum impact.
    - Use templates for:
        - Introduction email
        - Follow-up 1
        - Follow-up 2
        - Call-to-action email
6. **Cold Emailing Software**:
    - **Apollo**: Good for an all-in-one solution (Lead gen, email sending, and CRM).
    - **Instantly** ([Instantly](https://www.instantly.ai/)): Focuses on high-volume emailing with features to help avoid spam filters.
    - **Lemlist** ([Lemlist](https://www.lemlist.com/)): Known for personalization and automation capabilities, which can be highly effective in nurturing leads.
    - Effectiveness:
        - **Apollo**: 9/10 – comprehensive but can be overwhelming for beginners.
        - **Instantly**: 8/10 – reliable for mass outreach but lacks deep CRM integration.
        - **Lemlist**: 9/10 – strong in personalization, which improves open and response rates.
7. **Email Warm-Up**:
    - All email marketing tools mentioned (Apollo, Instantly, Lemlist) have built-in warm-up features. Start this process before sending your main campaigns to improve domain reputation.
    - Effectiveness: Crucial to avoid spam traps; must be done properly.
8. **Monitor and Adjust Campaigns**:
    - Track open rates, click-through rates, and responses.
    - Conduct A/B testing on subject lines, email content, and timing.
    - Regularly clean your email list to maintain deliverability.
9. **Align Website Content**:
    - Ensure the website reflects the pain points and solutions addressed in the emails.
    - Use landing pages tailored for cold email campaigns, directly addressing the messaging in your email content to maximize conversion rates.
