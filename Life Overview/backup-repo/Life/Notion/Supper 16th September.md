Based on recommendations from Tim Ferriss's book "The Four Hour Body," a typical breakfast should be high in protein and low in simple carbohydrates. Here's a comparison of the provided breakfast items:

1. **Prawns**
    
    - Calories: 40
    - Protein: 8g
    - Fat: 1g
    - Carbohydrates: 0g
    - Vitamins: B12, Selenium
    
    **Evaluation**: High in protein and low in carbohydrates, prawns align well with Ferriss's recommendations. The micronutrients like B12 and Selenium are beneficial.
    
    **Rating**: 8/10
    
2. **Tempura Battered Banana Chilies**
    
    - Calories: 180
    - Protein: 2g
    - Fat: 9g
    - Carbohydrates: 25g
    - Vitamins: A, C, Folate
    
    **Evaluation**: While providing some vitamins, the relatively high carbohydrate content from the batter isn't ideal according to Ferriss's preference for low-carb items.
    
    **Rating**: 4/10
    
3. **IPA Beer**
    
    - Calories: 200
    - Protein: 2g
    - Fat: 0g
    - Carbohydrates: 15g
    - Vitamins: B6, B12
    
    **Evaluation**: Alcohol is generally not recommended as a breakfast item in Ferriss's plan due to its carbohydrate content and lack of significant protein.
    
    **Rating**: 2/10
    

**Summary**: The prawns are the most aligned with the "Four Hour Body" guidelines for a high-protein, low-carb breakfast. Tempura Battered Banana Chilies and IPA Beer are less ideal due to their carbohydrate content. Overall, incorporating more protein-rich options and reducing simple carbohydrates would better fit Ferriss's dietary approach.
