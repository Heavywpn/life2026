# SUMMARY

YouTube video by an Australian couple camping in the Pilbara, discussing their day off at Running Waters campsite, cooking, and trying new drinks.

# IDEAS

- The couple is taking a day off at Running Waters, one of their favorite campsites in the world
- They plan to do a big cook-up for lunch and something simple for dinner
- The couple is hungover from drinking New England hazy beers the night before
- They use an AeroPress to make coffee in the morning
- The campsite's firewood is mostly burned, so they need to collect more
- They have a dog named Fred who likes to stir up water when they're trying to collect it
- They use a WO filter system to fill their water tanks, which has a self-protection mechanism
- The filter system drew about 3 amp hours to fill a 100L tank
- They set up extra solar panels to charge their car and caravan
- The couple plans to make pasta from scratch for lunch
- They use plain flour and eggs to make the pasta dough
- They discover double yolks in their eggs, making them excited about the extra richness
- The pasta-making process is more challenging without a pasta machine
- They cook the homemade pasta with cherry tomatoes, garlic, and bacon
- The couple tries various spirits sent by their friends who started a booze company
- They review different flavored agave spirits, including cinnamon, chocolate caramel peanut, and plain tequila
- The next morning, they plan to pack up and head to Cape Keraudren

# QUOTES

- "Welcome back to the inappropriate use of praos and Caravans"
- "We are planning to do a nice chilled day here"
- "Beers were consumed those New England hazies delicious"
- "Fred what are you do Fred leave it water no he's just he likes to just stir up wherever we're trying to use"
- "I'm amazed Fred hasn't gone for a swim already"
- "I never do this stuff at home by the way like I'd never make pasta from scratch at home cuz it's such a pain in ass"
- "I see why people use pasta rollers pasta machines"
- "How Bloody good past up from scratch using nothing but these bad boys"
- "Everything off the bottom while it's still hot it's not pretty ice get I think it's pretty you can smell it that's why"
- "That's dangerously good oh that and soda that's not surviving a trip that's for sure"
- "My suspicion is cuz I've had [ __ ] the bed vodka my suspicion is it's going to taste like acid reflux in a cup"

# Pasta Instructions

Based on the transcript provided, I can extract the following instructions for making pasta from scratch while camping:

Objectives:

- Make homemade pasta in a camping setting
- Learn to adapt cooking techniques with limited resources
- Understand the basics of pasta dough preparation

Instructions:

1. Gather ingredients: flour, eggs, and salt
2. Create a well in the flour
3. Crack eggs into the well

- Note: Double yolks can occur and are beneficial for richness

1. Add about two teaspoons of salt
2. Mix ingredients together to form a dough
3. Knead the dough, adding more flour if needed
4. Roll out the dough using a rolling pin or improvised tool

- If no rolling pin is available, a tin can be used as a substitute

1. Cut the rolled dough into desired pasta shapes
2. Boil water and cook the pasta for about 4 minutes
3. Prepare a sauce with ingredients like garlic, cherry tomatoes, and bacon
4. Combine cooked pasta with the sauce and serve

Additional tips:

- Allow ingredients to stick to the pan for better caramelization and flavor
- Salt tomatoes directly when cooking
- The pasta may be thicker than machine-made pasta, so adjust cooking time as needed

  

  

  

# Transcript

welcome back to the inappropriate use of praos and Caravans we are still at running Waters uh which is one of my  
favorite campsites in the world and we are planning to do a nice chilled day  
here so we're going to do a big cook up for lunch um pretty something pretty simple for dinner and then we got to get  
this whole shooting match out without breaking it too much but we'll see how  
we go with that and then onto our next destination which is pretty soon the kimbery  
it is the morning we are hung over [Laughter]  
um beers were consumed those New England  
hazies delicious so got the Arrow Press out made a couple of  
coffees washed up it's time for chilled day we need a  
chilled day yeah we've earned one we've earned one had enough [ __ ] go wrong  
we've also burned most of our firewood so we need to go get some more firewood that's all right yeah that one that log  
doesn't like to burn wet yeah it might be wet we we didn't cut that one it was  
already here so see how it goes I'm amazed Fred hasn't gone for a swim  
already Fred what are you do Fred leave it water no he's just he likes to just stir up wherever we're trying to use  
when we're trying to pick up water he just like stirs it up don't you FR so  
last night we filled up the tanks with this wo filter this filter here got like all  
brown and then we ended up cuz it was so it's actually Monier than I thought um  
and Fred stirred it up and Fred kept stirring it up so we ended up um overheating the pump which has it a  
built-in temperature thing um uh we didn't realize till the realize  
and it's got like yeah the UV thing has like a little alarm on it saying it's not getting water pump had stopped and  
we were like oh okay cool so we um let it cool down and then we cleaned the filter it's a it's a um ceramic filter  
so I pulled that out and you can just scrub it down with a normal scrubber took like 2 seconds and then waited for  
the pump to cool down it restarted and it carried on so really good to know that it's got like self- protection in  
it um and also to keep an eye on that filter to make sure it doesn't get too Mucky uh but yeah draws bugger or power  
I re it ran six amps I reckon it ran for 40 minutes with a really clogged filter and  
it filled 100 L tank no worries so that's it drew probably 3 amp hours in that time  
like nothing absolutely nothing to fill your tank  
um brilliant honestly brilliant little piece of Kit yeah and then we had like nice hot showers all the washing up just  
use as much water as we want like it's just so relaxing all right so we have  
set up some extra solar so I got two 300 W blankets cuz I'm a fancy boy um and that's giving us  
about 17 amps charge into the car so fully top the car up and then I'll put  
into the Caravan as well caravan's getting about caravan's under a tree so  
for obvious reasons it's not getting tons of solar getting 11 1/2 amp through the  
tree so not bad at all but with styling running it still draws about 10 so it's  
not really charging it's just going to sit we'll probably finish this trip at like 75% on the trailer so it's fine  
we've got like a 6-hour drive ahead of us after that so it'll fully top up um and if I plug the other solar panels in  
it'll probably toop up from that so yeah like we're very comfortable despite being in a not a very Sunny Spot like  
it's we didn't even put the awning out to be honest cuz I knew that it would just rub on things and but just a  
chilled day at camp and coming up soon we're going to make pasta from scratch  
which will be good it's good day to be a good day Amy man good day to be a good  
day what a spot we almost certainly go for a swim too yep definitely  
definitely nice warm weather Fred is very happy over there just chewing his  
ball and he keeps trying to lie on my bloody solar panels  
all right we're going to make some lunch that lunch is going to be pasta but not  
just normal pasta pasta from scratch so I'm going to  
need some flour now you can use fancy dou zero and all that kind of stuff but  
I'm going to use the flour I've got which is just black and gold plain flour  
in a fancy oxy container  
frothy probably should why yeah why they doing business go go on them you read my  
mind I was like soon as I started talking I was like [ __ ] actually smash a frothy right now I never do this stuff  
at home by the way like I'd never make pasta from scratch at home cuz it's such a pain in ass and you can get pasta from  
scratch you can get like fresh pasta sorry from like any Supermarket basically poison do you want sour uh new  
Goldies no I might have a um a purpley purple yeah  
hazy I've got gigantic eggs poor chickens  
um make a little well oh and I need like a cup or something oh double yoka oh  
epic is that one egg or two for pasta cuz I just used the  
yolks I'm going to call that two eggs yeah that's two eggs for sure that's wicked I'm never not buying Mega ever  
again if that's what we can expect dude if we get double y where's a that's a bigger one I'm going to get this giant  
thing  
massive oh epic two double yokers in a row I reckon there's a good chance this  
whole carton will be double yers and I've bloody split that one already but that's all right I'm still  
happy single yoker isn't a still monster a single  
yeah big single right damn that's living that is living Fred  
come here sit  
sit free that oh could you turn the hot water  
system on please inside next to my bed one button  
y okay now we get this all in together oh  
actually I've just screwed this up could you grab the salt out of there please it's in the left hand  
side and just grind in till I say stop yeah that one that  
one yeah that'll do cool so about two teaspoons of salt I'm going to put one whole egg in  
there  
should be right extra Yoki pasta yum oh there we go that's the right  
consistency soon as I added that extra egg it's just like all good now no  
wonder just yeah I thought the consist since he felt wrong I was like oh there we  
go should be right just add a little bit more  
flour should really not be doing this on like the extremity of the  
table making for a great gag just it would actually be our luck  
our mirror of the day would be that yeah it would be yeah yeah oh Jing you can find the  
roundest oh could you grab my nail Jane yeah want now Jane Rolling Pin  
yeah thanks man I think carrying a rolling pin in the bush is against the  
law it's like this is the most this is the most single purpose heavy thing you can ever  
carry especially when you're like you and you carry 10 carts of tins yeah exactly oh could just use a tin  
what do you think of the fridge double opener uh it's good once you get used to  
the press in and lift that's cuz it took me like a whole 24 hours of light just trying to break it open my lifting I'm  
so used to I have to say the first time I used it I was like I hate this handle mechanism and now I'm like it's just  
that's just what it is yeah yeah the double side I really good but yeah it's  
every every time Ronnie used it he just couldn't help himself he just did this yeah  
good he's like I just like it yeah this little Loop here is shooting  
[Laughter]  
me wonder how angry the Italians will get at me who knows who cares who  
cares tell you what there's one race of people who cannot accept anything but  
their own recipes you can have like a Mexican Japanese Fusion and the Mexicans and Japanese are  
like rad that was awesome Yep you put that actually sounds  
really good dude how good would like sushi tacos be oh  
so I love um oh have you ever I've had like salmon belly tacos before 100% so  
good so good and then like someone you know walks past carbonara with a piece  
of garlic and the Italians are like what is this this remember seeing a funny video you  
maybe it could have been at the most recent World Cup in Germany the soccer World Cup yeah and there were a bunch of  
like pommy pomm fans that long like things of spaghetti now standing in  
front of the Fant just breaking it like oh  
[Applause]  
that is brilliant T good trolling it's also it didn't come home just breaking  
past just good Flex I see why people use pasta rollers pasta machines I know I'm  
like oh no wonder that I got that pasta machine given to us cuz yeah this is a pain in the  
ass using all that farm strength yours yeah hold on no more strength yeah oh  
popy not Popeye but powered by tins suddenly you're thinking about B  
rolling yeah right I'm thinking about putting this couple of bread balls under my car just running the bastard  
over you like thick pasta right you're like we have so much left  
over past yeah look lasagna sheets whatever y  
me we just cook it for four minutes instead of three yeah exactly they're far out got to use all  
your na strength na uses a bloody past machine  
rolling pin no I don't reckon n as use plaster machines oh they totally do be sacrilegious no they're right plaster  
machines are good they're Halo yeah they're Halo unlike this bloody Haram NJ  
all right that's good enough yeah it's pretty  
thin you want to say a full recipe on this there is one on my channel  
bit of bloody flour on  
there fancy homemade pasta fancy fancy thick boys yeah it's pretty  
thick pasta thick greeny that'll be good oh yeah hard to go wrong with that many  
egg Yoles look how freaking yellow it is yeah I know yum yum kind of like Ramen  
noodles that sort of thing thick egg noodle yeah  
yeah how Bloody good past up from  
scratch using nothing but these bad  
boys olive oil because Italian  
huh what was that Jesus uh I don't know did the wheel Jo  
in that was violent could have been that was like  
inside and I was like what has happened like yeah yeah yeah I had turned around and it was all shaking I was like [ __ ]  
for a second I thought has this been like smashed down that's what I thought I was like it felt like something on the  
side felt like something major yeah on this side gone I was like I have no idea what that was no you  
it's right now we can stop faking having disasters for YouTube thumbnails yeah  
I'm get on with camping and then contends but man air fried 10 minutes in  
the air fryer don't even have to turn them the air fry bag okay put a garli  
obviously you grab out the Cherry Toms please yep how much garlic is too much garlic nobody knows it's never been done  
not I am fully making this recipe up as I go just vibing the quantities will not  
be in the description the recipe will not be in the description cuz it's just my thing that I'm doing cuz I feel like doing  
it it's been hungry yeah cuz I'm hungry and I want to eat you always put onion in before  
garlic only by a couple minutes though or a maybe a  
minute stry bacon because I like Flavor shortcut is basically ham and I like ham  
but not as a replacement for bacon are you shortcut or  
streaky uh depends yeah depends um  
if I'm at the supermarket I'll get streaky yep if I'm at like a farmer  
market with really dope nitrate free all that good stuff y i' probably go  
shortcut interesting there you go but ideally some of both yeah well you just get like  
the whole middle bacon yeah yeah exactly if I can find that then definitely but  
usually I have one of each man Denmark butcher oh  
his bacon is 10 out of 10 once you have that real proper bacon it's pretty hard  
to go back oh and the pinjara butcher his bacon is epic he gave me some straight out of the smoker he just gave  
me a piece of bacon fat and I was like oh thanks like raw bacon fat and I tried it and I was like oh wow this is  
actually incredible like oh my God it's funny when you cook real bacon and I  
just want like the grease comes out instead of water yeah yeah that dis gross like Supermarket  
bacon not interested incredible so good when you get proper stuff we didn't have access to my  
freezer when we bought these cuz my car wasn't getting fixed we just had the Caron which  
doesn't have a freezer on it um so we put it in the fridge for a  
while then they all th then they all stuck together and they refr and now we  
have a prawn bre like this literally prawn meat brick  
all right so much water yeah it's  
surprising that is way too much water dog of a thing what can you do y  
all right we going to let that all cool down put some water on for the pasture and get going  
chucking these Cherry Toms want them to soften up put a bit of salt and pepper on them as  
well always salt your Tomatoes directly right this is Sting to Brown up  
nicely you got some like good charred bit in here it's kind of sticking a little bit that's  
good yeah that's what we want yum it's got to get brown bits in it that's  
that's all the flavor  
kind of mushy which is good I want soft Tomatoes OK do let's get some  
pasta yum Hey sir set a timer for 4 minutes there's no reception here but we  
do have starving  
everything off the bottom while it's still hot it's not pretty ice  
get I think it's pretty you can smell it that's why yeah  
caramelization is pretty yeah we like that nice thick boys they are nice thick  
boys they're not done yet though pass is definitely a little bit thicker than that I liked it's like contracted over time it  
expanded into getting his Tong this time like a sensible  
person oh yeah Al Dente it's all  
done I reckon it can do with like 45 seconds but it's pretty much ready yeah  
and it's good  
yum are nice thick  
yeah okay gluten Factory yeah yeah no bloody brass extrusions here this is  
just some idiot with a knife oh there's pepper another there's  
pepperz there's Buck all and we would have put chili on it  
too if we had if we had if we had chili yeah but we don't hot smells really good  
it needs chili but it's bloody good pring  
right heaps of flavor from the  
caramelization absolute key complet letting it stick letting it stick always  
got to let it stick something the p is a bit too thick I'll be honest but it still tastes good that's  
fine you didn't have your roller or any idea that you now keeping the  
van P them back in pasta do it make it  
table in New England yeah oh yeah oh yeah perfect so  
our dolphin's washing up our mat's over at bunsters who we're going to catch up  
with um have sent me some spirits to try cuz  
they decided that to start a booze company because that's how Renee rolls  
um so I'm going to try C buns big bald cinnamon flavored  
Agave Spirits they're all like Agave Spirits we're not driving  
anyway let's give us a crack  
TR maybe maybe this cinnamon one to touch there you go bit of Fireball yeah  
it's basically Fireball oh that's really good that's a  
lot like Fireball that's good yeah  
that survivable yeah I don't immediately want to die fit the  
bad tequila that's cons last because it's chilly and going to  
diey this one nickers is chocolate caramel peanut L to  
Gar Spirit oh smells  
great okay that's delicious try this man got  
sh try that it's got a little bit of cinnamon  
mixed in with it oh nice that is good actually really  
good that's actually reminds me of it's like better than Bailey like  
frelo yeah frelo that would actually I almost reckon this would go well with like a slice of lime  
that's really good nickers this one's called you can rate  
it that's just tequila for  
this I actually really like tequila good tequila bad tequila I really don't like and  
immediately triggers my gag reflex okay I like tequila lime and soda it's a  
very good  
drink that's dangerously good  
oh that and  
soda that's not surviving a trip that's for sure  
it's that one just ailer I know you're not a two kiler guy but I I  
caness is it yeah it's so it's so clean  
man wow that's very dangerous it's like very good like actually excellent yeah  
someone can definitely have gag reflex with tequila that was that was really good  
there's no gag reflex that that's just a nice drink yeah actually really really good yes oh by the way uh I'm making my  
own Spirit oh nice they're helping me make it what are you going to call it finger to  
bump and this is just a bad idea this is just yeah you can have that one to  
yourself bro yeah tastes like smells like hot sauce and Tequila Jesus  
my suspicion is cuz I've had [ __ ] the bed vodka my suspicion is it's going to taste like acid reflux in a  
cup that is nowhere near that's not even  
bad that's actually quite good I would have that with soda water  
this is not sponsored I just wanted to try  
them I wish I didn't like up let's see how it goes out the other  
end yeah spicy in spicy  
out my my pick this for sure I don't have much of a sweet to it so these ones  
this would be good in like the snow cold weather that kind of thing yeah this you know this would be great in a in an  
apple pie M and great if you've never spewed offall yeah absolutely this was  
surprisingly like actually very nice very like I'm going to have one now yeah there'll be some yeah you 4% alcohol God  
damn You' be asleep in a park like pretty quick yeah that's pretty standard for Spirits though yeah but with how  
easily that went down for oh my God yeah yeah you can have like four shots you can have like 50/50 mix and it' be like  
H lovely You' be like I'm fine and the next minute you're in a field yeah next minute you're like where am I who am I  
why am I in the ocean should you wake up in the field being like Oh how did this happen  
yeah this great M actually doing my washing up my mates never did my washing  
up [ __ ] mates [ __ ] mates so carrying on with our theme of  
boo reviews we've just done spirits now we're going  
to try now this is semi sponsored but also  
it has no bearing on whether I like the beer do that make sense they gave them  
to us but um so this is a cbco Goldie logger I'm not a logger Drinker you are  
a lger drinker yeah sometimes drer yeah yeah no I I probably drink logger more than  
actually used to drink mostly ler yeah I'm probably more of a  
wanker um a cbco like mid strength smashing like six mid strengths on  
Saturday typical dad typical dad without kids yeah just a typical 35y old male  
yeah yeah that's a good clean loga honestly  
tastes pretty close to an export maybe a bit more flavor bit more but it's I  
think it's a bit cleaner yeah it's less money yes yeah yeah muddy but yeah exactly um alcohol  
4% I've never drink I'm I'm not good at I'm not good at loggers if you like if  
you like loggers smash you'd absolutely smash this yeah you could session like 10 days for yeah yeah this is a good  
sessionable logger yeah you could drink you could drink the whole can in one thing on like a hot day  
after working outside it's like um midmer as your  
first more flavorsome version of like a great northern or something like that oh  
yeah like way more flavorsome than a great northern way like actually no I'm not I'm not going to put in the same  
category as great nor I'm going be that's rude why are we comparing to that no that's that's [ __ ] yeah delete that  
content it's a good beer yeah it's not my choice of CBO but it's a good  
beer so we've had a very hard day as you can see had to sit down  
um light in the fridge was a big big load on us it was pretty difficult getting the beers  
cold that actually was like yeah a couple hours couple hours yeah had turn  
had turned the fridge down and then wait then wait with only probably two cold cartons
