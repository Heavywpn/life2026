Hall Brian Shaw Thor they are all00:00:02.800 world's strongest men winners but they00:00:04.279 all take second place to the true00:00:06.000 all-time greatest World's Strongest Man00:00:08.320 Marius panowski00:00:13.000 his career was not without00:00:15.720 controversy Mario from po 25 years old 100:00:20.320 M 186 130 kg So today we're going to be00:00:25.199 going through not only one of his00:00:26.960 classic gym routines but also his00:00:29.000 strongman routine as well well we're00:00:30.400 going to learn a lot of information00:00:31.800 about Marius and we're going to see if00:00:33.200 we can survive this psychotic dominating00:00:36.440 man's workout00:00:38.120 routine oh man I don't know only00:00:41.600 training very good Training flip and r00:00:45.000 no problem Marius did a lot of warming00:00:47.559 up whether it was jump rope whether it00:00:49.480 was Mobility like lateral squats he also00:00:52.199 did a lot of warming up in preparation00:00:55.359 for exercises such as the squats he did00:00:57.840 up to eight warm-up sets before we00:01:00.120 moving on to his working set so as00:01:02.039 Brandon is warming up I would like to00:01:04.159 introduce someone that's going to help00:01:06.320 us out through this workout someone00:01:07.960 native to the country of Poland my wife00:01:10.799 agneska and she's going to be a little00:01:13.479 bit of our judge referee and she's also00:01:16.520 going to reward us with this um very00:01:20.240 comfortable polish Banner as you can see00:01:22.560 here when she really feels that were00:01:24.720 worthy of the00:01:28.920 colors00:01:30.280 [Music]00:01:40.180 [Music]00:01:57.439 for Polish sty00:02:04.920 yeah I feel proud of00:02:07.160 myself po00:02:10.000 sc one bit of controversy during00:02:12.400 marius's Reign is the fact that there00:02:14.319 was a couple different organizations the00:02:17.040 ifsa and also the WSC so you had00:02:20.160 athletes in both of those which kind of00:02:22.120 split the competition a bit and some00:02:23.680 people feel maybe that diluted the00:02:25.640 competitive field there was also of00:02:27.680 course the Arnold Classic where when00:02:29.959 Marius did compete in he never plays any00:02:32.400 greater than fourth maybe you could have00:02:34.200 done00:02:36.000 more so that's where some critics may00:02:38.640 say he didn't face the best of the best00:02:40.879 but regardless his time in the ifsa he00:02:43.800 did win the five titles and the ifsa to00:02:46.840 this day is still the premier00:02:48.879 organization yes I'm very happy squats00:02:52.680 are out of the way we're moving on to00:02:53.720 pull-ups this one we feel a little bit00:02:55.239 more confident with this is kind of00:02:57.080 constantly a staple although squats were00:02:58.920 too it's just is we're not used to the00:03:00.760 weight of that capacity so we've got six00:03:03.360 sets 15 reps a lot of Endurance on this00:03:06.640 one some critics argue that many events00:03:08.720 in marius's years lean more towards00:03:10.720 endurance and stamina playing to his00:03:12.920 strengths including events like Farmers00:03:14.959 walks Atlas stones and some truck pulls00:03:17.360 drags that required more of that00:03:19.280 cardiovascular fitness than pure00:03:20.959 strength and he really excelled in these00:03:23.519 type of events there was also less00:03:25.599 emphasis on static strength events like00:03:27.760 the max deadlift squat or overhead press00:03:29.959 which test absolute strength were00:03:32.560 arguably less common or emphasized00:03:35.040 during this period and finally pu00:03:37.080 janowski's athletic background he had00:03:40.080 experience in sports like boxing and00:03:41.840 rugby which really contributed to his00:03:44.239 Superior endurance compared to some00:03:46.159 competitors who Focus solely on strength00:03:49.599 training00:03:51.560 oh I think I'm going to spend my next00:03:53.760 set doing this this feels way better00:03:55.799 than the pull-ups we're on to set five00:03:58.040 I'm going to need a little bit of that00:03:59.079 polish spirit we're going into00:04:01.599 overtime keep me going give me that oh00:04:06.560 SC give me that here we go here we go00:04:09.640 okay that's now we have the Polish um00:04:13.000 the Polish cloak on of invincibility00:04:16.079 this is like Harry Potter right00:04:17.320 here strong man style okay the Polish00:04:19.560 cloak of strength nobility and fortitude00:04:49.639 wow that was the Polish Groot squeeze of00:04:54.120 activation and Truth00:04:59.960 M Jin yes you'll notice in this that is00:05:02.800 a combination of legs and00:05:04.759 shoulders that's why you can do so much00:05:07.960 more weight it's not just a push press00:05:11.960 it's kind of like a push like in your in00:05:14.880 your dipping under the bars you push as00:05:17.039 it's F floating up and you catch it and00:05:19.880 then squat the rest of the way there a00:05:22.000 lot of legs in this and you'll see maros00:05:24.440 he does a ton of weight on that00:05:27.759 particularly because it's not just all00:05:29.120 on the shoulders although he obviously00:05:30.560 had very strong shoulders but it's it's00:05:32.919 a lot of driving the legs and the hips00:05:35.479 that's really important in this and they00:05:36.720 do a lot of that in strong man that's00:05:37.880 why he's turning that way in there too00:05:39.759 oh oh00:05:43.000 btoa duja Maz00:05:46.000 chesna bless you exactly yeah I have00:05:51.280 been blessed Super00:05:53.639 mazna S Superman I can die now but don't00:05:58.039 die during this workout I might that's00:06:00.000 why I could say I can die now we will00:06:02.000 bury you in this growing up to me there00:06:04.400 was nothing more exciting than sitting00:06:06.880 down on a Sunday morning booting up ESPN00:06:09.039 2 seeing there's a world's strongest man00:06:11.199 cuz they kind of came on sporadically00:06:12.599 back then and seeing Marius just Crush00:06:14.800 those events man cuz when you knew he00:06:17.000 got to the endurance ones whether he was00:06:18.639 like pulling something really heavy or00:06:20.720 running holding something like an anvil00:06:23.240 that guy just crushed it I mean no one00:06:26.039 else stood a chance you know he' pick up00:06:28.520 the heavyweight bring them up the stairs00:06:30.599 and you'd see the other guys you could00:06:31.680 actually see it in their eyes look at00:06:33.400 him and go how does this guy do it and00:06:36.080 what's really crazy is in one of Brian00:06:37.960 Shaw's first competitions he actually00:06:39.599 went up against Marius and it was a00:06:41.599 really tight race but in the end Marius00:06:44.120 just pulled ahead enough to win so it's00:06:46.560 a little exciting bit of almost like00:06:48.199 passing the torch in a way onto the next00:06:50.120 generation of strongman and that is why00:06:52.319 it was so cool to see those guys compete00:06:53.919 just once which Brian Shaw is on record00:06:56.080 saying he was just really so blown away00:06:58.080 by marius's work ethic he would practice00:07:00.800 the full World's Strongest Man days00:07:03.680 before the event itself to prepare00:07:05.520 himself and if there was a certain00:07:06.759 exercise he didn't quite understand such00:07:08.560 as like the circus dumbbell he would00:07:10.360 just learn it over and over and Brian00:07:12.360 Shaw would be watching him do that in00:07:14.800 awe going wow so this is how you become00:07:16.639 a champion and later Brian Shaw become a00:07:18.759 champion00:07:22.720 himself you got it00:07:25.919 nice yeah it's really cool seeing00:07:27.720 marius's tram because he not only did00:07:29.520 did all those big compound movements00:07:31.240 that he used to train for the strong man00:07:33.319 competitions but he also implemented a00:07:35.680 lot of isolation work a lot of00:07:37.280 bodybuilding style movements like flies00:07:40.199 tricep extensions bicep curls crucifix00:07:42.759 curls it's really cool seeing that and00:07:44.159 obviously it paid off cuz he had an00:07:45.680 amazing physique and a physique that00:07:47.400 rivaled some of the top bodybuilders00:07:49.599 even today so naturally we're going to00:07:53.120 end it off with doing some flies oh yeah00:07:56.479 cuz a lot of times it's all about the p00:08:01.580 [Music]00:08:11.159 man come at me bro which is you know00:08:13.840 this Segways perfectly into the fact00:08:16.879 that when Marius retired from strongman00:08:18.720 he actually entered mixed martial arts00:08:22.360 competition and that's true that's00:08:24.840 actually true so um I can actually see00:08:27.120 this was maybe the Genesis of Mario just00:08:29.080 getting so at the weights all the time00:08:30.240 he's like and he's like Bingo fighting00:08:32.958 career um we actually need our polish00:08:36.279 judge referee historian because she's00:08:39.159 going to tell us when Marius entered his00:08:41.399 first mixed martial arts00:08:43.039 competition it was a really big event in00:08:45.839 Poland Poland is a nation of 40 million00:08:47.800 people a lot of people of course know00:08:49.440 who Marius is tell us a little bit about00:08:51.680 marius's first mixed martial arts about00:08:54.680 um yeah I remember the whole family was00:08:56.600 watching and uh I was a kid so you know00:08:59.160 I don't I didn't know much about the00:09:00.880 sport at the time but um I do remember00:09:03.880 it being very quick and very surprising00:09:07.360 I think what I remember was just him00:09:09.519 getting onto the ring and just ramming00:09:11.880 into the other guy and that was it so00:09:15.079 that was definitely shocking and you00:09:16.720 know interesting and we were cheering00:09:18.560 but I was a little confused as a child00:09:20.680 cuz I was like is that how it's supposed00:09:22.399 to look like that is not how it's00:09:23.880 supposed to look yeah it wasn't so much00:09:25.480
