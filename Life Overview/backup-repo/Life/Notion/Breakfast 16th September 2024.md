### Breakfast Evaluation Summary

**Comparison with "The Four Hour Body" Recommendations:**

Tim Ferriss's "The Four Hour Body" suggests a slow-carb diet that often includes the following breakfast items:

- Protein-rich foods such as eggs
- Legumes like black beans
- Avoidance of dairy, fruit, and refined carbohydrates

**Evaluation:**

- **Scrambled Eggs:** Aligns well with the recommended high-protein intake. Eggs are a staple in the slow-carb diet.
- **Black Beans:** A good source of protein and carbohydrates, fitting within the recommended legume intake.
- **Aero Press Black Coffee:** Low in calories and carbohydrates, coffee is generally acceptable if consumed without sugar or cream.

**Micronutrient Analysis:**

- The breakfast provides a variety of vitamins and minerals including Vitamins A, D, B12, Riboflavin, Folate, Iron, Magnesium, B2, and B3. These nutrients support the dietary needs as outlined by Ferriss, though there is no specific emphasis on micronutrients in his plan.

**Rating:**

- Given the alignment with Ferriss's recommendations, particularly the inclusion of protein and legumes while avoiding refined carbs, this breakfast earns a rating of **9/10**.
- The rating reflects strong adherence to the principles of the slow-carb diet, with room for improvement in diversifying protein sources or including additional vegetables.

Overall, the breakfast is well-suited to the goals of "The Four Hour Body" and supports a balanced, nutritious start to the day.

To improve your breakfast to a perfect 10/10 score based on "The Four Hour Body" principles, consider these five recommendations:

1. Add vegetables: Include spinach or kale in your scrambled eggs for added nutrients and fiber.
2. Increase protein variety: Add a small portion of lean meat like turkey or chicken to diversify protein sources.
3. Boost healthy fats: Include a small serving of avocado or a handful of nuts for beneficial fats.
4. Optimize timing: Aim to eat within 30 minutes of waking for optimal metabolic impact.
5. Consider supplementation: Add a fish oil supplement to enhance the meal's anti-inflammatory properties.

Implementing these changes will align your breakfast even more closely with Tim Ferriss's recommendations, potentially boosting its effectiveness for body composition and energy levels.
