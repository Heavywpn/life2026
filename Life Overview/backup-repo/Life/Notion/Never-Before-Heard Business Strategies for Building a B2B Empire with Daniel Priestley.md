7:52

don't agree with that speaker it's like man he's he's bringing you the best to the best from around the world like it

7:57

don't like it but you know it's incredible what he's doing interesting you know well I had it well we did the

8:02

first the first live podcast that we did we did with Steven at the bi Opera wow and so we had him one evening for the

8:09

best part of an hour and it was great the audience loved it he was fantastic you know again as you say very polished

8:15

very put together and he um and he and you know dropped some bombs as well which is what people like to see yeah

8:22

and the guy works he's a he he puts in the work he's not he's he's not lucky

8:27

he's working interesting and also interviewed sah Davis from Dragon same

8:33

thing she's that Steven's just one in a million you know he's he's he's that he's going after pizza oh I think he's

8:39

going after Branson okay I think in terms of I think where he's going to end up he'll be in the he'll be in the

8:44

billions what he's doing with flight fund and flight media is absolutely genius it's new school private Equity

8:50

he's got a private Equity portfolio of scalable businesses and a Content portfolio of podcasters and the

8:56

podcasters can promote the businesses and it's all seamless it's all extremely well thought through strategy uh one

9:03

thing feeds the other and vice versa and one by one these businesses are going to sell and sell and sell and sell he'll

9:10

have exit after exit after exit there'll be a year where it's like oh yeah Steven Bard sells this one for 500 million he

9:15

sells this one for 700 million he just sold this one a little bit like what Ryan Reynolds has just

9:21

done interesting okay enough about Steven cuz we're not here to talk about that really but I'm sure everyone would

9:27

have asked the question okay look there's a lot of people out there they're entrepreneurs they're salese

9:34

they're you know at some stage on their Journey some some they're doing better than others um you take the real estate

9:40

industry here in Dubai obviously it's flying at the moment but 80% of the people selling real estate aren't selling any real estate you know you

9:47

you've got really and the staff turnover I can give you some examples so one developer that I uh know very well they

9:54

employ 70 new people a month 70 sou people a month s stick well hold on 70

9:59

new people a month I've got the stats which is 840 a year 30% stay they have

10:05

they have to write a deal in the first three months they got 90 days if they don't they can they're out okay and the

10:12

training that they're given is like two days okay and it's like crack on go find some and you know it's to me being some

10:20

of that comes from a keen training background it's like what training these guys getting to be able to do the job and their business model as I looked at

10:26

it costs them tens of millions of dams a year just in recruitment must now then

10:33

you take a a real estate brokerage here the chances are that if they keep 50% of their staff they're lucky they generally

10:39

lose 50% in the first 6 months because people come here the buy is expensive they run out of money they don't work

10:44

very hard they like like Hollywood yeah a little bit of that but then then we take into consideration wealth managers

10:51

financial advisors people that are selling anything okay as a essentially an entrepreneur within a business a commissionary sales person and then you

10:57

got these guys that are starting businesses and when I think about business setup a lot of people say to me know you need to do this and the brander

11:04

and I'm like no you don't you need to make some sales yeah cuz if you make some sales you get some money through the door you get money through the door

11:09

you breathe yeah and sales fixes all problem that's right and it's like as long as the revenue is coming in you you can lift a fight another day you

11:16

absolutely can yeah and we can perfect this and we can perfect that but but let's get some money through the door and I think people are really challenged

11:23

by that and they get some paralysis from analysis um they overthink things um

11:28

some people go back to the really old school way of doing things and get stuck with Wellies in the mud there thinking

11:33

that's it you know they're out networking at networking events and spending time kind of prospecting at

11:39

networking event shoving the business card under someone's nose I do this you know um uh or they're doing which has

11:45

now been banned in buy they're making cold calls oh you can't do that no it's been bned buy the government brought out

11:51

a really new it and there's a 50,000 deice it's £10,000 fine if you get CAU cold call it okay so and and they've

11:58

also done that from for with the real estate brokers advertising properties without their their rearend numbers on as well so what

12:04

we're seeing is a lot of these people that you and I look at opportunity and we're like home run baby you know we

12:11

look at that what how could you not make that a success yeah but I think you and I are a little bit a little bit further

12:18

apart from these people and these setups and they listen to us and they're like I

12:24

get it but it's that how do I Implement these stages so the first thing I want

12:30

to do is I want to qualify you as the right person to tell everybody what to do okay okay then I'm going to you know

12:35

go go go really basic with you okay see what we can do so first of all for those that don't know you why should everyone

12:42

right now for the next hour of their life sat in the car on their walk sweeping the garage on the treadmill on

12:48

the stair climber why should they listen to you so I'm an entrepreneur for the last 20 years uh I've built and sold

12:54

several different companies I've had seven businesses that I've started that have gone zero to a million in their first 12 months with without funding

12:59

without any of that sort of stuff bootstrapped U my background is in sales and I love sales I'm passionate about

13:05

sales and Performance Marketing so all of the stuff that actually generates leads and makes sales that's my

13:10

wheelhouse that's my that's my whole strategy um uh I've had three companies go north of 10 million in value uh I

13:18

have bootstrapped all of my own businesses um and I've run an accelerator for the last 10 years where

13:24

we've worked with 5 a half thousand companies that are bootstrapping to their first million of Revenue uh and

13:31

essentially that's given me an enormous exposure to what gets a business moving what makes a business get off the ground

13:38

so I think there are plenty of people who understand corporate there are plenty of people who understand business and exits and all of those sorts of

13:44

stuff but that initial liftoff period I don't think there are many people who have seen more than I have and have also

13:50

applied it um and I've also written six books on it um so you know very much up

13:55

to my elbows in getting things off the ground good okay well qualifies you now doesn't is that enough that's good

14:01

enough I think that's good enough for me enough exit I can keep I can keep working but we'll say that that

14:06

qualifies you now I remember the first time I ever heard you you were on a stage somewhere at some big event with

14:12

other speakers and you came on stage and I was the guy that was the old school salesman okay that had built a business

14:20

on networking referrals okay and cold calling many years and then I was

14:26

exposed to this world okay this world of digital media digital marketing running

14:33

ads and understanding all of that and you were on stage and you speak eloquently and you speak in plain

14:39

English which I loved but still I was like yeah but how do you actually do

14:47

that because that all sounds so I open this this this this business account on

14:52

Facebook and then these look alikes what this look and it was just another

14:57

language so what I did did okay is what I think a lot of people do they find an agency to help okay they don't know they

15:05

don't know if it's a good agency a bad agency they might get a recommendation but they have this agency and this agency say whatever you spend money on

15:11

we're going to charge you 20% of your advertising spend but we'll run ads for your product and we'll create landing

15:17

pages and you know what your business is going to fly is that the

15:23

pitch and in seven of those following experiences I had with seven agencies

15:30

that all promised me the world but delivered me an atlas I learn I learned that that wasn't

15:38

actually happening now when it when it didn't work out they said to me your product your service what you're

15:44

offering not many people want it's niche blah blah blah blah blah and it to me sounded like a lot of excuses yeah now I

15:51

could have taken that money that I'd paid and I could have had three or four people sat in the office making cold

15:57

calls yeah okay and they would have got a better result because I'd have trained them how to do it better but it's 2024

16:04

this is a this is old Business Development this is old strategies and so what I want you to do is when you

16:10

talk you talk to me at a level that I get now yeah but I didn't get then and I think that people won't get you want me

16:16

to turn it down a little I just want to get right down into it and say right we're starting a business you and I okay let's say we're Partners okay let's go

16:23

through a process let's choose something to sell uh she cars if you want want us

16:29

talk I I'll go with whatever you want to go with okay have we we've got a business to sell though we've got we've

16:34

got products to sell can I can I rewind a little bit slight rewind right we we'll we'll come to that I do want to

16:41

say this before you start a business before you're a number one I'm a massive believer that you should be a number two

16:46

or a number three you should be a direct report to an entrepreneur so I do want to qualify this by saying I'm not

16:52

someone who says everyone can start a business right away everyone can start a business at the right time but um

16:59

starting a business is a very difficult thing to do and it's a it's a different skill set um I've hired people out of

17:05

corporate in fact I've hired a few people out of corporate recently and they're Shell Shocked by the way small

17:11

businesses run and mind you small for corporate means like less than 100 people so they're like shocked when you

17:17

put them in a room of like oh yeah the whole company's in this room called eight people uh they you know they can't

17:23

get their head around it um I've spoken to corporates and I'm like hey what do you you know what do you think we should do with the buiness oh I think you

17:29

should hire these three types of people that are 100 Grand each I'm like okay right that's an interesting starting

17:34

point so like corporate mindset is very very different you hire people you hire agencies you know you go looking for

17:41

specialists in this and a specialist in that you go through a whole procurement process if you did that in small business you're out of the game you are

17:48

done um you know you've got days before before you have to put a run on the board or else you're in trouble

17:54

so the the first step to starting a business is being a direct report to to an entrepreneur that's a that's almost

18:00

an essential step so you're working in corporate you don't go start a business no way you go and join a small team you

18:07

go and join a team with less than 15 people where you are directly reporting into an entrepreneur every single week

18:12

and that you're getting direct exposure to how that business runs the beauty of being in a small business you're going to see how it all runs you're going to

18:18

see how they generate leads you're going to see the dashboards you're going to see cash at bank at certain times so most businesses they share that sort of

18:24

stuff chasing your salary sometimes exactly and yeah you work for an entrepreneur go oh by the way cash flow

18:29

is really tight we need to make seven sales this week or else we can't afford payroll sometimes they say that so

18:35

you're going to get a visceral experience of what it's like to be you know an entrepreneur by being a direct

18:41

report to an entrepreneur so if you join the Army they're not going to say oh you're lead a platoon straight away they're not going to say become a

18:46

Corporal or a lance corporal they're going to say you start as a you know infantry and you're going to do a little

18:52

bit of time there and you're going to work with a Corporal and Alliance Corporal you're going to see how they run a little section then you're going

18:57

to have a tenant who's running your platoon and you going see how that feels and then you're going to move up to a

19:03

little being a Corporal or Lance corporal and then you're going to you know you're going to work your way up you know there is not a lot of

19:08

transferable soft skills that go from oh I'm an executive for a massive company and now I'm going to start my own

19:14

company so there's this halfway step called being a direct report for an entrepreneur so I just want to put that out there that solves almost all

19:22

problems um when it comes to starting a business being number two or number three it makes the number two decide

19:27

well I'm never doing that on my own no chance yet to totally or gives them the confidence or gives them the confidence

19:33

often it opens them up to tactics it opens them up to strategies it opens them up to a network of people who

19:38

support small businesses and entrepreneurs so all of that sort of stuff happens when you do 6 to 18 months

19:44

uh as a direct report to an entrepreneur so that's kind of First Step um and you know anyone who's listening to that

19:50

saying oh yeah I just want to skip that step okay but you're throwing yourself in the deep end you know so I I don't

19:56

recommend I think you're going to earn money in the next 6 to 18 months working you might not earn as much as your

20:01

corporate salary but you know you're not going from you know 150,000 a year to

20:06

zero you might go from 150,000 a year to 90,000 a year but you're getting that

20:12

learning you're getting that experience of of start if you jump into the deep end straight away it's like it's like

20:17

going into the gladiator's den and being given a sword and not knowing how to use it what chance have you got make it in

20:23

in what realm do you get to be a number one straight away like there's no realm that you just step into a number one

20:29

um I was number two number three number four direct report to an entrepreneur so it's like you know everyone everyone

20:36

who's great is a direct report first to someone who's who's kicking goals so so

20:41

I just want to lay that Foundation as a as a starting point that I really strongly believe in okay oh and I'll

20:48

make one other point on that I've had 10 of my direct reports go and start seven figure businesses really yeah so there

20:54

are 10 there are 10 multi-million dollar businesses that exist in the world right now as a result of people who were a

20:59

direct report to me and was that was that with your love or in spite of you uh there's only there's only one that I

21:05

that left on bad terms all the others uh were on great terms and I wish them well and they are amazing and it was

21:11

absolutely with my blessing yeah the right thing for them to do perfect good okay good right let's get stuck into it

21:18

I don't if we should we choose selling cars should we have Services should we I like Services I like B2B Services B2B

21:24

Services want B2B space okay there's a lot of B Toc at this time trying to is trying to find the customer B Toc is

21:31

hard you're in a volume game when you B Toc right you got to build a brand you got to have bulletproof systems people

21:37

don't realize this most people who start a business for the first time one of the

21:43

ways that I know someone's an inexperienced entrepreneur is they go for b2c they want to do a a business to

21:48

Consumer model and that means they're going to have to sell thousands of units of the thing they're going to have to

21:54

pre-order thousands of the thing they're going to have to build a brand that cons consumers consumers are so fickle they

22:01

make decisions snap judgment emotions brand all this influencer likes the thing right you're going to have to have

22:07

warehouses of stuff this is a black belt move like you're a black belt entrepreneur if you're doing B Toc uh

22:12

successfully B2B on the other hand where you're selling to businesses businesses to business you're making an appointment

22:19

you're going in and seeing someone that person might have a $50,000 budget for that thing they can make you know two or

22:26

three meetings and make a $50,000 purchase if it goes wrong they'll just talk to you about it and say hey this is

22:32

what we need you to do to to to do this well there's no there's no emotion they're not going to make a snap

22:38

decision to get rid of you um they're going to talk you through what we need from you it's going to be much more of a relationship they're also going to

22:44

pre-order something and then expect you to fulfill it as opposed to having to have the thing and then expect you you

22:50

know man you are resonates with me so much because I remember when I started the sales training business I was like

22:56

I'm going to go out and Train everybody okay and I built this course online it's all my work and hard effort into it

23:01

tried to sell it online did well in the first month struggled thereafter dealt with loads of people moaning and winding

23:06

about stuff from time to time you know credit card chasing credit card payments and stuff and then a company approached

23:12

me and said can you come and do that and I'm like yeah this is the price they went yeah I'm like you need to pay for three months they went yeah and then

23:19

went can you make sure that you're in at these yeah I was like oh and by the way and it was it was three times as much as

23:25

what the the individuals have p Ah head and I'm like of course and and by way can we just do that for the rest of the

23:30

year or two can we do two years worth of it but but what happened then is other companies approach me oh you're doing such and such with this company can you

23:36

come and do the same with us before I knew it without without the drama okay

23:41

well look in the UK the average income in the UK is something like £30,000 so

23:47

if you're going to sell something for £1,000 it's 130th of someone's household budget um whereas when you sell to

23:53

businesses to corporates you know they might be a a business doing 100 million to billions and you know you represent a

23:59

tiny fraction so being a small business that sells to big businesses um or mediumsized businesses That's Where It's

24:06

At that's that's the place to start you know something that's B2B and services is is a good place to start because you

24:12

don't have to invest a lot of capital into the production of something you produce the services after you've won

24:19

the the deal so it's it's a much better place to stock now if if I was coming out of corporate and I wanted to start a

24:26

business take whatever you're doing in corpor for it and break it into five parts and sell it to five clients at a

24:33

premium as a Consulting gig bring in some of your other corporate experience and bring in some of your corporate

24:38

buddies and all of that sort of stuff take what you already understand and know go and sell it to a few different

24:44

clients now you've got an experience of starting your business now you might do that for six months or a year and then turn what you know into software turn

24:51

what you know into um a training program so there's all sorts of ways you can go from there but um those are the easier

24:57

those are way easier way way easier than um than uh bet Toc okay well let's do

25:03

that let's go down that path there so we're B to be we decided that's what we're going to do we're going to sell these we're going to sell these coaching

25:08

Services fantastic we are going to be business strategists business leadership strategy coach

25:16

consultant and isms um so we've got the skills we've got the experience we've

25:21

we've produced something we've written some some soft copy stuff we've you know we've got an idea about what we want to sell we're clear on that okay okay and

25:28

now um we've got our connections from the past yeah and we've got not much

25:34

else we started to watch some videos online we we've seen how you know running Facebook ads running Instagram

25:40

ads Tik toks this thing you know LinkedIn as well okay these different things I can do to generate leads but

25:46

you know I know okay if I go and network I might be able to meet some people I know if I get a list of 20 people I

25:51

could cold call them not in Dubai you can't not in Dubai you can't yeah absolutely get fined day one so what

25:57

what what where do I start do I do do what do I have to do because I know I don't like social media and I'm really

26:03

uncomfortable producing videos it's not it's not something that sit well with me you know I've never made videos before

26:08

and I frankly I look ridiculous on videos so I don't do first thing first first things first there's all sorts of stuff you're going to do in business

26:14

that you don't like doing that's just given you don't like paying taxes well okay Dubai maybe don't have to do that

26:19

but you you there's all sorts of things you don't like doing and you do these things right some of some of it you're

26:24

going to like some of it you don't like the the things that we like are typically things that give fast rewards and dopamin hits and you're going to get

26:31

dopamin hits from different things in business but there's going to be stuff that you say uh I'm not comfortable with

26:37

that and 3 months later you'll be totally comfortable with it you know the first time I got in front of a camera and heard my voice and saw my face

26:43

realized I got the double chin under here or whatever it's not it's not the square jaw that I imagined that I had

26:49

that then I'm sitting there going ah you know I never want to do that again and then 3 months later you get over yourself and say actually it's not about

26:55

me it's about serving my customer and it's about getting my message out and all of that sort of stuff so like riding

27:00

a motorcycle it feels deeply uncomfortable the first time you do it and 3 months later you go actually I'm comfortable riding the motorcycle cuz I

27:07

did it every day for 3 months so we got to get over ourselves a little bit and do what works and not what we feel

27:13

comfortable with because feeling comfortable comes after the fact not before the fact here's what we're going to start with we're going to start with

27:19

a piece of signature content signature content ideally will be a written piece of content that is going to outline your

27:25

thesis all right so that's going to basically be 500 to 1500 words and it's

27:30

going to explain to anyone in plain English what you see is the problem where the problem exists what are the

27:36

symptoms of this problem what people try and it doesn't work um what the solution

27:41

might look like some of the principles around the solution it's going to cover your credibility um where you've noticed

27:47

this how you've solved it in the past and the fact that you've got uh some solutions around this so we're going to

27:52

call that the central thesis the signature piece of content that's going to be a document that keeps coming up over and over and over again you're

27:58

going to have that on your LinkedIn you're going to have that on other different platforms when you're talking to people you're going afford them the

28:03

link to that um you're going to message a few people and say hey I've just written this you might want to drop a comment on it or if you you know if

28:09

there's one thing I can ask you know we've known each other for years if you could drop a little comment on this I'd mean the world to me at the moment I'm

28:15

just getting started right so we're going to create a central place where our Central thesis lives so that's going

28:22

to be one of the the the the first things that we're going to um do so constructing a thesis as to why this

28:27

business exist if we're business strategists we're going to talk about how most businesses are getting strategy

28:33

wrong or most teams aren't led the right way or most teams aren't doing the right strategy at the right time if we're

28:39

Simon cynic we're going to create a document called start with why and why it's important to do that um if we are

28:45

um Ben Hardy we're going to talk about 10x is greater than two 10x is easier than 2x if we're Daniel priest we're

28:51

going to talk about BEC a key person of influence and that's going to be 500 or a th000 words these are the five things

28:56

you need to do so Central piece of content it's kind of like the the the living document the pitch that we want

29:03

to have and that's going to be a key thing what we're then going to do is we're going to outreach on social media

29:09

to about 3,000 people through groups through hashtags through followers and

29:14

we're going to say I just wrote a piece of content it's based on my experience of the last 10 years um some great case

29:21

studies I I saw your profile and I thought you might be interested in that piece of content let's go back to this one let's go down even de even

29:28

I'm going to take this piece of content and I'm going to I'm going to go to groups on Facebook so I find the groups

29:36

that Facebook not so much for B2B let's talk LED L LinkedIn have groups as well yeah LinkedIn Twitter um is is they

29:43

stick with one let's go LinkedIn so we've got LinkedIn everyone knows what LinkedIn is so I've got this piece of

29:48

content I don't just post it in my feed I go into the groups so I join groups we we're going to post it as an article on

29:55

our LinkedIn so it's article on our LinkedIn and then and then we go to these different groups that are industry

30:00

specific and we join the groups and then we post the article in the group and we ask people to comment on it we we can

30:06

just let them know I've written ask for feed if you love I'd love it if you drop a comment on this I've just put you know I've just written this key piece of

30:13

content you Dro me a comment or or um I thought you might find it interesting so how many groups do I do that with is it

30:20

5 10 20 what is it I found that you need to be able to drop a message to about 3,000 people it takes a few weeks to do

30:26

this but it's this is part of just getting a new idea going you mentioned advertising before um I think

30:33

advertising is an excellent accelerant but not a good fire starter so if I'm trying to start a fire um let's say I've

30:39

got a log that's not burning and I tip some petrol on the log that's not burning nothing happens if I've got a

30:45

log that's burning and I took petrol on it the whole thing explodes so it's like that with uh a business if your business

30:52

is hot and you tip advertising on it it's going to get real hot and real big real fast what do I mean by hot your

30:59

your messaging is on point you've got your case studies your testimonials you've got uh your way of describing the

31:05

problem you know exactly who your ideal customer Persona is all of those sorts of things you've you've really figured

31:11

that out um and when all of that's working and you're making sales and you've got leads coming in you've got

31:17

appointments you got sales conversations happening all of that's happening tips and tips and fuel on that fire and watch

31:23

the whole thing you know ignite um but it's not a good way to start so we don't want to spend any money it's a little

31:29

bit like you know I run content on my socials and I did I did some videos around um the floods that took place

31:35

here and those two videos went mental viral I mean the comments people were

31:40

arguing and fighting with each other in the comments and stuff like that so we could see clearly that that piece of

31:45

content was attracting a huge amount of organic interest it's that that they

31:51

pour the kerosene on and throw the throw the lighter onto it well sort of if that's your business so yeah yeah if

31:56

that's your business the content is related to your business yeah absolutely so so I've got I've got this piece of

32:02

content I've gone into these groups I've got to reach out to 3,000 people at the bottom of that piece of content we've got a call to action and the call to

32:08

action is if you're interested in this for your organization drop me an email okay right or if you're interested in this join my waiting list I'm launching

32:15

I'm launching a new service to help people with this this problem here's the link to the waiting list so signature

32:20

piece of content with call to action at the bottom and the call to action is either drop me an email so drop me a direct message or join my waiting list

32:27

um I'm I'm going to be launching something if you want the information join the waiting list those are excellent little ways to just just super

32:35

we want to fail fast and fail cheap we want to do fast cheap experiments at the beginning okay so let me go out these

32:40

3,000 people I do exactly that what determines if it's a success or not what

32:46

percentage of those 3,000 would would would be considered doing okay getting started depending on how much we're

32:53

going to charge per client we may need a few people to be interested we might need three people who are going to spend

32:59

150 Grand each to be interested um now there's a little bit of a rule here

33:04

which is if you currently have a small audience you need to charge a lot for what you do you need to go high value if

33:12

you have a big audience like tens of thousands plus you need to come down to a moderate price point maybe maybe 2 to

33:20

20,000 and if you have a massive audience of 100,000 plus million plus

33:26

then you can start looking at low price points so like training programs and and things like that so even though the percentage

33:33

of conversion might be the same because it's a much bigger number you're you're converting a a same percentage but a

33:38

much bigger number exactly now I see people get this wrong all the time so someone someone goes out to start a business and I say oh you used to work

33:45

at some amazing corporate that everyone's heard of what are you going to be doing oh I'm going to be doing coaching and training with these

33:50

organizations oh how much you going to charge oh £1 1220 a session and I go

33:56

well $120 a session or $200 a session I'm like where did you get that number from like oh well I worked out how much

34:02

I was earning in the corporate and I divided it by 250 days and 8 hours a day and I came to like a small number like

34:09

that's a crazy way to come up with a number you need to come up with a number of what it's worth for the client and

34:14

you've got the ability to add value to the client so what we're looking for is we're looking for a small number of clients who can get a really good return

34:21

on investment for what you do so whatever it is that you figured out whatever intellectual property you've got whatever stories you can Leverage uh

34:28

you're looking for the a few clients who have a really high uh potential to get a return on investment from that unless

34:35

you've already got thousands and thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of followers in which case you come right down in price

34:40

point and but most people haven't when they start so that's the reality big audiences I love small recurring Revenue

34:46

payments like I love 49 a month times you know well 49 a month times uh 1,500

34:53

clients that adds up real quick right but you need 100,000 Plus in your audience to do that so we want to go

34:59

right down and we want to say okay typical contract value is going to be $100,000 we're going to go in for 100

35:05

grand contracts um because I've only got a small audience so that may shock some of your listeners straight away that

35:10

they've actually got to start with really high value small number of clients it's interesting because a lot

35:17

of people will be saying well that's really expensive I I'm not worth that the the the philosophy that I work with

35:22

is if you're earning 50 Grand a year as your salary your objective should be to make that a month

35:28

so work out how you can make that in a month so let's say it's 10 10 grand a client okay well you need five clients a

35:34

month to be able to do that so how are you going to get the five clients the other thing too if you were earning 50

35:39

Grand a year there's a good chance that you were making your organization 500 Grand yeah yeah whatever you were doing

35:45

was making 500 Grand now there was two ways that you were doing that you were doing that through your time being there

35:51

and you're also doing that through that uh through something called intellectual property which is knowhow or skills and

35:56

knowhow so you've got to kind of tease apart when you're starting a business and say okay I used to sell my time but

36:03

actually I've got my intellectual property and my stories and my um you know my my credibility and uh my ability

36:10

to solve problems and all of that that's my intellectual property and I'm going to be trying to trade on my intellectual

36:15

property more so than my time interesting I remember when I first started doing this kind of stuff and I

36:20

was charging uh 500 an hour $500 an hour sorry not pounds and every time I put it

36:28

up it didn't impact things and I charge $25,000 an hour now and and I don't do a

36:34

lot of it but the people that ask me they say go can I have an hour of your time I'm yes $25,000 and then some of them go what but most of them go okay

36:41

fine um is it two and is 1 hour and enough or do I need two hours you know it's surprising you're absolutely right

36:47

the behavior that people have around it okay so I've gone out make sure for everybody so you don't you don't you

36:53

don't miss any of this okay we've gone out we've got this thesis we've gone out with documents got to LinkedIn we've got

36:58

out to the groups we've got some engagement from people in the groups they've come back they're commenting and they're saying let me get on this weight

37:04

list that's interesting so out of the 3,000 people let's say I've got 120 people that have responded and said said

37:10

and that's a great and that's a great example by the way 120 uh cuz 3,000 people aren't going to respond of course

37:16

most people are going to ignore you that's normal most people walk into an Apple store and don't talk to anyone and don't buy anything and walk out of an

37:21

Apple store and that's Apple so you know if Apple doesn't get everyone you're not going to get everyone so exactly that

37:28

like 100 like 3,000 4% 120 you just said 4% conversion I love that 4% conversion

37:35

is a great great goal and don't get hung up on the people that are saying no and the people that are ignoring you just

37:41

because they say no it doesn't mean anything personal they just might not be interested in what you're selling why would you expect everyone to be

37:46

interested in what you do yeah the timing might be wrong a hundred little things could be wrong but 4% conversion

37:53

is a great idea so 120 people they're commenting they're liking they're saying I'm interested in that all of that sort

37:59

of stuff so now that we basically now we've got this little bit of momentum we got the tiniest bit of momentum we want to harness that and we want to let

38:06

people know there's a couple of things we want to tell people a story there's a magic story and it is built around a

38:12

magical sentence and uh it took me 15 years to find this sentence so this is to the 120 people yeah this is to the

38:18

120 people um the sentence that we're going to send them is I did something special with a certain type of person

38:25

and we got a remarkable result right so that's three part sentence I did something special with a certain type of person we got a remarkable result so you

38:32

have to be able to outline a sentence from your past that meets that criteria

38:37

that sounds like that story so like for example when I was La launching score out I messaged people and said in 2016

38:44

we launched a scorecard campaign uh it generated 90,000 leads and we made 20

38:50

million of sales off the back of it um and I'm going to be unpacking that and showing you how we did that now people

38:58

do not want to hear what your plans are for the future they want to hear what you've done in the past now it doesn't

39:03

have to necessarily be your company you could say I previously worked for Microsoft and we worked on this big

39:10

project and we got a great result and I'm going to be sharing some of the things some of my top seven lessons or

39:15

that that apply to small businesses right whatever you can talk about from your past that's what that's the story

39:21

it has to be short Punchy and it just needs to be those sentences I did something special with a certain type of person we got a remarkable result I'm

39:28

going to be unpacking it here's here's what to do next got it so we go back to everyone who liked it everyone who

39:34

commented on it everyone who showed any interest whatsoever and we tell them that story with a call to action and the

39:40

call to action is going to be either join the waiting list book an appointment with me um book into a zoom

39:46

webinar that I'm going to run where come along to a lunch that I'm going to put on host I'm hosting a lunch for people

39:52

who are interested in this whatever it is you're going to give them a couple of different ways to connect and you're say

39:57

I'm I'm hosting a lunch or I'm running a zoom call I'm I've got a waiting list I've got some appointments in my diary

40:03

if you want to hear about how that story played out right so that's the magic formula perfect that love it love it so

40:11

now we've got this situation where now these 120 people have have got this and a percentage of those 120 people are go

40:17

oh okay now they go from the stage and I and I use these different so it starts off the 3,000 to me is a word called

40:24

Data the people that now have expressed an interest I now call suspects mhm okay

40:29

cuz they're not actually prospects yet they're not I've got a simple acronym that I've used okay I bet we're so on

40:37

the same page with this but we use different words I use laps laps is leads appointments presentation sales leads

40:43

appointments presentations sales okay right every business I've ever gotten off the ground for the last 20 years we

40:48

have a lap dashboard lap dashboard every single week we are me measuring how many leads to be generated this week how many

40:55

appointments to be book Into The Diary how many how many people did we present our value to and how many B how many

41:00

sales did we make and my my very first company we had uh we hired this

41:06

townhouse I had one bedroom that was my office Glenn had one bedroom that was his office and we had a hallway between

41:12

us and we had shoe boxes marked leads appointments presentations and sales and

41:18

what we would do is whenever we had any leads they go into the leads shoe box and then we call them and we do all that

41:24

then they go in the appointments we booked in a and then they go and then we staple the credit card payment to to the

41:29

sales and that goes into the sales that was our first CRM system that was our liter really the original shoe box

41:35

system yeah right so when I see CRM I that's that's my original visceral experience and it was brilliant at the

41:41

time wasn't it yeah we did we did 1.3 million in our first 12 months those types of experiences for me it's like

41:47

they're so visual where CRM systems don't offer that nowadays it's so visual to see it cuz I I had two card boxes on

41:53

my desk I had a two red ones it was a to z in here and January to December in there and the cards would go from here

41:59

to there from here to there and once they were turned in again just like you there was an A4 sheet like that the card

42:05

was stapled to the front so the guy could go and do the appointment okay and that's exactly what we used to do okay great excellent right so I've got these

42:11

people that are kind of interested okay they're not buying anything yet but they're kind of interested they've read through this article that sounds like a

42:17

bit of me okay okay now we've given them a story yep and we want to convert some of those people to what to an

42:24

appointment to want to book an appointment an appointment is someone books the time to show up so they say yeah I'll come to your lunch that's a

42:29

booking that's an appointment they say yeah I'll have a one to one with you that's an appointment I'll join your Zoom webinar that's an appointment to

42:35

any booking into the diary that is a very strong signal of interest that person has said it's worth my time to

42:41

learn more about what you're saying right now what they're really saying is you've presented me that you've got this

42:48

thing that you do I'm telling you I'm interested in that it on the surface it appears that this could be a good fit

42:55

it's actually pretty big deal for to even just book an appointment with a new business so booking appointments is not

43:02

some necessary step it is a really strong signal of interest from the market that that they're saying hey my

43:08

time is valuable but it's worth it to hear more about what you're saying okay good excellent stuff so now

43:14

there we we're starting to feel something here we starting to feel good about it we the confidence is going up

43:20

now you know we we could get it wrong still but the confidence is going up now we've got this this presentation so let's let's break it down into very

43:26

simple formats one is is a one to one the other one is essentially a group a on to group okay if if you you've got

43:33

this and you've you've got the option what would you choose considering you're at that stage you know we're not 10

43:39

years down the road we're in this first early stage what do you think would the best approach be you got 120 let's say

43:45

of the 120 let's say just for simple numbers of 24 convert okay would we

43:50

convert 24 to a onet to one meeting cuz I know I would my first my first thing

43:56

is that I want to do one to ones yeah because if I screw up a 21 to 24

44:01

presentation that's it that's it right all of that effort um you know on Netflix they have comedians who get the

44:08

Netflix special MH the only comedians who get the next Netflix special are the

44:13

ones who have done 300 standup shows in the year before right they do they're

44:19

doing stand up stand up stand up stand up stand up stand up they do it over and over and over again and during that

44:25

process they just sharpen and sharpen and sharpen and sharpen and by the end of the year they are so funny everyone's

44:32

howling with laughter that's when they do the Netflix special they don't do it at the beginning so it's the same as

44:39

sales you're going to say something in presentation one that just completely goes off topic and you go wish I hadn't

44:46

have said that you're not going to do it in number two number two you're going to say some metaphor and you going go oh

44:51

it's a bit like how lions and you know they chase zebras and the person goes ah lions and zebras I get it now now I'm

44:57

going to use that again right so you're going to open with the line and the Z story all right so then you you just

45:02

start building your repertoire by the time you've done 241 to ons you are Miles better than you were on

45:10

appointment number one mhm so ultimately we want to get one to many we want to get in front of groups um obviously

45:16

that's a great use of time if you can be in front of 25 people at once for an hour of your time to 25 people fabulous

45:24

that's that's where you want to end up you got to sharpen up in the Market before you get to groups okay so our apprenticeship is lots of oneto ones on

45:31

a regular basis until we get to the point where we're super slick super confident our conversions of those oneto

45:36

ones is high okay and then we move to the next stage of like I can't keep doing oneto ones there's not enough

45:41

hours in the day for all these people I want you I want you to think of onet to ones as research right not one to ones

45:48

right in the early days and I'll give you a quick anecdote on a fail failing is fine yeah it's totally fine so I've

45:54

got this i got this friend of mine who's a billionaire he's done three super successful companies first one sold for

46:01

160 second one sold for 900 million uh third one's worth 2 and a half billion you know blah blah blah he's phenomenal

46:08

guy he was his team were uh looking at adding a digital product that was $9 a

46:13

month that was going to scale and the first thing he did is he did a series of onetoone appointments where he

46:21

personally a billionaire with a jet literally has a has a jet he was doing

46:26

one to W sales meetings because he wanted to be up close and personal with customers he

46:31

wanted to know why do they say yes why do they say no this is for $9 a month product and he I reckon he probably did

46:37

50 to 100 of them it's interesting you say that you know we have talbat here in the region which is the the deliverer

46:44

equivalent that we have and Tomaso Rodriguez is the CEO and every three months he goes out on the motorbikes who

46:51

goes and does deliveries for a day and he learns so much it's like it's the best experience he has you know cuz he

46:56

finds out how they struggle the first time he did it he put his mobile phone in the holster yeah lasted an hour cuz

47:02

the sun was burning down and it and they went dead and he's like how can I do my deliveries I haven't got a phone now little stuff like that the guys are

47:08

getting really hot you know so he came up with these let's put coaches around the city air conditioned coaches at a parked up with cool drinks in them and

47:14

sofas the boys can pull up they can get on the coaches chill out for half an hour and then get back to their work and

47:19

it's just like that that Insight that he got okay is exactly the same he say doing the $9 I'm going to get the

47:24

Insight I'm going to learn yeah I'm going to be on so you don't think about this as like some you know thing that's

47:30

beneath you this is entrepreneurship this is product development this is not just sales this is also Innovation this

47:36

is this is how you this is knowing the building block of your company one big difference between being an employee

47:43

versus being an entrepreneur is as an entrepreneur you are responsible for the demand side of your business when you

47:49

join a team when you join a corporate 90% of the roles are supply side roles

47:54

even the demand side roles are under big umbrella called a big known brand and momentum and all that sort of stuff so

48:00

even if you're in sales and marketing and you are responsible for a little bit of demand generation you know the

48:05

Cavalry is around you as far as you know compared to an entrepreneur the the

48:10

difference between the primary difference between an entrepreneur and an employee is one is responsible for

48:16

demand generation one's not one's responsible for supply side so this is a

48:21

cataclysmic important event in your life that you are going to be solely responsible for ating demand so you got

48:27

to be hands on with this you better know exactly how your customers think you better know exactly what problem you

48:33

solve and how you solve it and why you're better than everything else and why you're better cheaper faster with more emotional benefits safer all of

48:41

that sort of stuff you got to go yeah I I completely know how my customers tick that's the key to being a great

48:47

entrepreneur the great entrepreneurs they know how to generate and manufacture demand so they what about that entrepreneur that says you know

48:52

what I'm just I'm not good at sales M okay it's

48:58

just it makes me feel you know clingy and ugly and it feels like i' got creepy craes all over me I'm just I don't like

49:05

it at all so why don't I just you know if I can employ A salesperson to do that part would that be a good idea in nine

49:11

times out of 10 no if you're going to be good if you're going to take that stance you better be one hell of a technical

49:18

genius you better be technically the best the best of the best what you do so if you're Adrian neie well if you're

49:24

Steven aie right Steven my co-founder who who's here um he is a technically

49:30

genius level coder and it developer and CTO he is phenomenal at running Tech

49:38

teams he he can get Hands-On and code he can look at a a developer code glance at

49:44

it and go why did you do it that way talk me through it and he knows exactly what he's talking about he can recruit

49:49

talented Tech uh technologists because he can talk their language and he can

49:55

weed them out in minutes so when we've been recruiting developers he'll have a 15-minute call and know whether

50:01

someone's going to be a phenomenal Talent or not so Steven doesn't need to get good at sales because he's got me

50:07

now why has he got me because I need him right so the two of us make a great co-founding team because I can I'm I'm

50:14

the be I'm probably one of the best in the world at making sales and he's one of the best in the world at building

50:19

Tech so the two of us just go really really well he doesn't have to worry about making sales and I don't have to worry about building Tech so how long

50:26

has he worked with you for we've worked together for 18 years 17 years but you didn't have him in the beginning well

50:31

well he was a little agency that I used to build build and stuff no in the in the beginning I was you you know I've

50:37

always I've always built products I've built training and Consulting products and then I discover Steve and I'm like

50:44

oh software's where it's at we can build software now because I've got Steve and Steve's like oh cool I can build software now because I've got Dan who

50:50

goes out there and sells it got it yeah so okay so let's down this journey this is interesting so we're now we're now at

50:56

a point where we with with I can I just quickly say the the guy who's not Steve

51:02

who doesn't like sales let's imagine for a moment that you do bring in an amazing sales person yeah they got you over a

51:08

barrel yeah they got you over a barrel they like if if 70% of the revenues

51:13

coming through that person they're now your co-founder whether you like it or not they own that they own half that

51:18

business whether you like it or not um because if they stop the whole thing stops yeah um and at any time it's way

51:26

easier for a talented salesperson to replace you than for you to replace the talented salesperson in the early days

51:34

so so you better get good at sales which goes back to the point of the beginning no Revenue no business yeah exactly yeah

51:40

everything's Downstream from lead generation everything's Downstream from sales can't generate leads can't make sales doesn't matter how good you are at

51:46

anything else okay so let's say i' I've evolved a little bit and I'm now going to a place where where I'm I'm I'm

51:53

getting good at selling and I'm now going through to this wanting to to do it as a one to many type of approach a

51:59

on to group type of approach because I just don't have the time to do it otherwise this is how I got to do it SC how do I how do I

52:06

qualify this group of people yes they've responded to this to this this piece

52:11

this article and these following articles that I'm writing so I've got this steady flow of people coming in 50 people once a week want to come onto

52:17

this zoom and learn okay but there could be 50 taxi drivers mhm so let's say that

52:23

we've now gotten to a point where we've got steady laps so everying single week we've got a whiteboard in the office and

52:28

we've tracked our leads appointments presentations and sales and it seems to be building we're getting some leads we're booking some appointments we

52:35

present to them our pots and pans we show them what we do you know we say to them you know here's your problem here's

52:40

our solution here's what you've tried in the past and why it didn't work here's some insights about that here's our

52:45

methodology here's here's our package here's our solution here's our offer what do you think do you want to get

52:51

started with it who do we need to talk to next right and it's going well right leads appointments presentations and

52:56

sales now we want to scale up a little bit Yeah mhm so we need to start doing

53:01

one of there's a few ways that I approach this I love to have a a zoom call every couple of weeks um so in week

53:08

one our team fills the zoom call in week two we deliver the zoom call and follow up make sales then we repeat it so we do

53:13

that twice a month eventually we're going to do that every week so we're going to just get people in front of us

53:19

on the zoom call and we're going to be able to present to more and more people um so that that's one way that this

53:24

takes off when people register for a zoom call we ask them a series of questions tell us a bit about who you

53:31

are um now one of the best ways that I ever scaled up was I uh implemented a

53:37

strategy called assessment based selling so assessment based selling is what your doctor does so when you go into the

53:42

doctor and you say hey I'm not quite sure but I got this really weird thing with my elbow and it's hurting and you

53:47

know I can't it comes and goes and sometimes I sleep or not it's really painful doctor says let's get an x-ray

53:54

or let's get an MRI so they do an assessment and then when they look at the assessment they say ah I see what it

53:59

is you need this and you need to here's the treatment plan so assessment then treatment plan that's how doctors sell y

54:05

um the best way to sell Services the best way to sell to corporate the best way to sell many things is assessment

54:12

then treatment plan so what you want to do is say like let's say you're a public speaking coach we say okay take this

54:18

online assessment and that's going to tell us where you know where you score in three or four areas that are

54:23

important for public speaking oh you scored a 42 2% but you're going to need to be an 80% plus by the time you do

54:29

your 12 in front of the team so let's get you working on the things that you need to work on it looks like you're not

54:34

this isn't a problem this isn't a problem but here's your three big problems ah the assessment makes the sale um you know if you're a strategy

54:41

consultant like we talked about great let's do a strategy assessment oh looks like you you're strong in two areas but

54:47

you're weak in three areas let's work on those three areas go ahead so we do that so what we want to do is like launch an

54:52

assessment and launching an assessment is between 10 and 40 questions that that tell people how they score in a

54:58

particular field and once we're starting to talk to people we've got our signature piece of content um we're

55:05

going to be posting three times a week to keep refreshing people to see that right so so we're going to repost down

55:13

we're going to reproduce new articles what we're going to do is we're going to do lots of little posts uh throughout the throughout the week minimum of three

55:21

and those three are going to reference the uh or link back to the the P content

55:26

and so that's going to be in our feed yeah this will just be our standard post um the minimum viable posting strategy

55:33

is Monday Wednesday Friday Monday is going to be um all about uh the prize

55:40

right it's going to be a positive uplifting thing that talks about what people want right what they want to move

55:45

towards Wednesday is going to be about news right so industry news anything

55:51

that's newsworthy anything that's being talked about we could hijack major news and talk about how it relates to our

55:57

topic right so we can hijack some news on Wednesday Friday's going to be um pain um and we're going to talk about

56:04

the frustration or the annoyance or something like that um so uh pain news

56:09

and prize are our three things we talk about every week so the pain is something I don't want the prize is

56:15

something I do want and the news is just what's going on around us and that rhythm is phenomenal Monday Wednesday

56:21

Friday mesday Wednesday Friday paying news prize pain what if I've only got 300 followers well you build them really

56:27

fast um I I didn't want uh I didn't want to be on LinkedIn to be honest a year or

56:32

so ago and I recognized that the market had moved onto LinkedIn uh 18 months ago

56:37

the market all went to LinkedIn uh Twitter became a bit hostile and other platform Facebook was dropping off

56:43

LinkedIn very quickly became the place to do business so I'm like I'm going to have to suck an egg and go and be on

56:49

LinkedIn more uh and I went from a few thousand to 65,000 followers in a year

56:56

year just I'm posting three times a week so you know I did I did deploy one

57:02

little technique around this which is I put together a WhatsApp group of 10 friends and I said when we each Post in

57:08

LinkedIn we all go and like and comment on each other's them just to give it a little bit of an algorithmic boost so

57:14

just drop the link into our little WhatsApp group and we'll like and comment on each other's stuff so this is

57:19

called a follower squad or a engagement Squad um very common practice all the

57:25

big do it the you know the big Superstars they all have their Superstar Squad um so I just picked 10 people who

57:32

I thought would be non-competitive friendly fun people to do that with for a little bit we did it for 12 months we

57:37

all blew up our our LinkedIn um profiles amazing Okay so we've got these three

57:43

pieces of content going out every week referring back we've got this stuff that we're doing where we're should should we be commenting on other people's content

57:52

I haven't seen a huge return on investment for that I haven't um if if um I I would prefer to drop them a

57:59

direct message and say Spence I just saw you did an amazing piece of content I've commented on it that I loved it by the

58:06

way I just think potentially we should be having a conversation because you're talking about some of the stuff that I really deal with and address you mention

58:13

that you're frustrated by this that's something that I help people with if you're interested in it I've written a piece of content that outlines my thesis

58:20

around why that happens and how to solve it have a little look right so yeah that that we might do

58:26

but not just randomly roaming around trying to hijack someone else's feet okay so another thing we need to

58:32

consider is that we need to be patient we're not in a a get rich quick race but we have to remember also that we don't

58:38

have an unlimited budget yeah we do have to kick we've got we've got to make some sales somehow yeah so but we've been

58:44

busy we we can still continue to do some oneto ones yeah okay and we can do more

58:50

than one group session a week we could do three or four you know if if we're able to yeah if we can get an assistant

58:57

uh who can book people in if we can Outsource some of this stuff to an assistant oh my goodness we can blow this up real fast but as long as we're

59:03

getting these these qualified people so the assessment is really important to establish whether these people are the

59:09

right people for us to be making a sale to anyway yeah so every business needs what i' would call a glass slipper so

59:14

the glass slipper in the Cinderella story is the very quick way that he knows if she's Cinderella or not right

59:20

so he can roam around and say a lot of people are saying that they're Cinderella but I need to figure out who Cinderella really quick so I'll just

59:26

slide the glass slip on real quick and then no no no oh there she is right so we need to have something like that in

59:33

our business and an assessment is a good glass Clipper so answer these 10 questions and then it'll give you a

59:39

score so that'll do that or when you register for my um when you register for

59:44

the uh Workshop answer these three or four questions so we want to ask a few little qualifying questions and it could

59:51

be what size business have you got have you already got a budget are you ready to get started on something could be some of those qualifying questions that

59:57

just help you to understand am I dealing with you know big companies that are slow to move or am I dealing with people

1:00:03

who haven't urgent need and want to get started right away so it just gives you a bit bit of qualification so this leans

1:00:08

into score card marketing okay and score up the business that you set up that I know that you set up some time ago and

1:00:15

this this this fascinates me because everybody without question has been on

1:00:22

the phone or in a meeting with somebody that isn't qualified we used to say in financial services

1:00:28

years ago you'd get to the meeting thinking that the guy had x amount to invest and he was actually looking to raise capital and you be like oh for

1:00:36

goodness sake you know it's like I came all the way to see you and the actual opposite and we've had half an hour of

1:00:43

fantastic Rapport I've introduced the company I explained how we work and they've go yeah do you know anyone that

1:00:49

can help we raise some money for my startup oh and so and so that that that that is such a good example and then we

1:00:55

go back to the office and we say to the guy that made the appointment didn't you qualify this yeah I did qualify it you

1:01:00

know you ask the ask questions I know all he is I know his wife from gids I know his job title you know this I know that okay he never mentioned for one

1:01:07

minute you know that he was starting a company was Raising Capital we was talking about something else Nightmare and so there's that there's

1:01:14

there's the booker trying to make the appointment because he's he's motivated to do that okay the the the potential

1:01:21

client being a bit Savvy cuz he's like older than minut do these people raise Capital well I might as well have the meeting to find out

1:01:26

okay and Johny the financial advis going off I you know basically what he says so

1:01:32

when we when we consider that it's like I I any salesman any business owner okay you me and only wants to sit in front of

1:01:40

people that know what we do know why we do it and have an expressed interest in what we do and you'd explode your income

1:01:46

or explode your business if that if you just had a better qualifying you know process if that qual if you were just in

1:01:53

front of qualified people the business would just be booming that's that's half the battle um so Al but also it's more

1:02:00

fun let's be honest way more fun you know Everyone likes to sit down in front of their prospects but they want to sit

1:02:05

financial advisor real estate broker I want to sit a car salesman I want to sit down with somebody that wants to buy a car you know Sal sales is enormously fun

1:02:12

if you're with the right people um so yeah that qualification piece you know your time is so valuable that you want

1:02:18

to protect it and you want to sort of make people jump through a few Hoops in order to get time and you know what it

1:02:24

doesn't turn people off uh you know Louis Vuitton makes people wait out the front of the retail store

1:02:31

before they get to go in the retail store to look at a handbag and people want it even more um Rolex puts you on a

1:02:37

waiting list for 3 69 months before you can get your hands on the watch so heres

1:02:42

man you buy their Crockery first you can start with this stuff over here and then we'll let you into this half of the

1:02:48

store so you know people actually like anyone who's serious likes the fact that

1:02:54

you're qualifying them and if you do it in an elegant way they go this is great look it's the ultimate takeaway clothes

1:03:01

that's what it is people want what they can't and it's the same as every person that's ever been in a relationship will not ever what nearly that when that

1:03:07

person dumps them they're desperate for them to come back because you've just taken something away from them taking us away okay and it's also that whole idea

1:03:14

of look you know we don't have magic ones we can't work with everyone we're very selective about who we take on as

1:03:19

clients would it be okay if I ask you some qualifying questions to make sure that you're the right type of person so we're not wasting your time or else hold

1:03:26

yeah that's me let's flip it on to them we don't want to waste your time we want to make sure that we can provide a service for you you answer these

1:03:32

questions to make sure that we're qualified for you yeah you know cuz that that John doesn't want to waste his time you know talking to somebody that does

1:03:38

something he doesn't want to buy and yeah look uh the the the high in real estate that I want to show you everyone

1:03:45

wants to see it right now so I've got to ask you some qualifying questions I can't march a thousand people a week through that person's house can I ask

1:03:52

you some qualifying questions before I take you in and show you the dream property and people are I really want to see this

1:03:58

property right so the professionals qualify they're really good professionals they they're not afraid to

1:04:03

qualify they love qualifying but when you're doing that qualification from a group point of view you can't have those

1:04:09

individual conversations it's just not time efficient to do it so score app which is your your your software you've created which we use at our company okay

1:04:16

so not a plug or anything but we use that product enables us to be able to qualify those prospects so that when

1:04:22

they do jump on that Zoom if it was 30 it's now 20 or it's now 15 I'd rather have the 15 that are Keen than the 30

1:04:30

that might include 15 maybe he all not so shes the the score concept was born out of us having way too many leads we

1:04:37

were getting I wrote a book and it was a bestseller and I got on some big stages and I was in front of 500 people a

1:04:43

thousand people we had a point in time where we had lots and lots of people running to talk to us when we created

1:04:49

the key person of everyone scorecard it was 40 questions measuring you against your personal brand and if people

1:04:55

answered a certain way we knew they were going to be great clients so roughly speaking if they had an overall score

1:05:01

between 15 and 55% under 15% they didn't have enough strength in their foundations um and we

1:05:07

would have had to work really hard just to do the basics um over 55 they were really kind of on their way and um you

1:05:15

know they they saw diminishing returns from us but The Sweet Spot was 15 to 55% if they scored that within that range on

1:05:22

our scorecard we knew they were perfect so there were other things built into the scorecard that allowed us to do that

1:05:28

but basically when we launched this we launched as a value added scorecard for you to measure your personal brand

1:05:35

990,000 people completed it um and it came with a PDF report people loved it

1:05:41

um they got value straight away when they would get on a sales call they want to talk about their results hey I've got

1:05:46

42% and it you know really highlighted that I'm not doing any joint ventures and Partnerships and can you help me

1:05:52

with that and so it was perfect it was just so great right so we ended up building these for multiple companies we

1:05:59

built them for uh music production company and we built it for consultants and we built it for a Fitness training

1:06:05

weight loss company so we're doing all all of these scorecards and I've just seeing the same result over again you know qualified leads better appointments

1:06:12

more targeted conversations okay I get that there there's I know there's going to be some people going yeah

1:06:19

but how on Earth do I come up with the questions oh there's a great way to do that so cuz that's that's going to be

1:06:24

that's going to be for some a stumbling BL well this was a stumbling block right up until November

1:06:30

2022 uh so there's this little thing called by the way that none of this is convoluted all right we're having an

1:06:35

honest conversation here it just so happens that he has some solutions to this exact problem and I need you to

1:06:42

understand what they are and how they work because I really believe they could add some value to you that's all all right so just bear that in mind I love

1:06:49

it November 2022 chat chbt comes along and now we just ask chat chbt and it

1:06:55

tells us en answerer it's phenomenal it was so much so that we just built it into the platform so when when it comes

1:07:00

to actually um building one of these you just literally tell chat TBT through our

1:07:07

platform you say this is what my business does you describe it however you want to describe it I help

1:07:13

restaurants that are familyowned to improve their menu okay great however

1:07:19

you want to say that or I work with uh high-end Dubai real estate uh to sell

1:07:26

properties off the plan so however you would say it you just say it and then who's your typical buyer uh overseas

1:07:33

people from the USA or London or Germany okay great that's all it needs to know

1:07:39

and then it comes up with like a dozen Concepts and says what about this one what about this one you pick a concept

1:07:44

and it then says okay great here's a list of all the questions we could ask and they're all there and you can just

1:07:49

edit them or go add add add add add add add add full B category question

1:07:54

category question here's a category how long would it take me to do it 6 minutes so 6 minutes to put it together six 6

1:08:00

minutes and it will write 1,200 words it'll write your landing page it'll create all the questions it'll create

1:08:07

Dynamic results page and in six 6 minutes later you've got yourself an entire scorecard that people is my

1:08:14

Landing past the article you said that I was going to be posted we talking about something else cuz you and I know what they are but no everybody does yeah the

1:08:20

landing page is the page that sells the scorecard so when I arrive on the landing page

1:08:26

telling me so we're sending it to these 30 people we can send it to yeah and we can announce it on LinkedIn once we've

1:08:32

got some people we can drop people a direct message and say hey I've just launched this scorecard um are you ready

1:08:37

to invest in Du buy real estate uh you answer I want okay I want I want to stay

1:08:42

B based because I want this this this to be a formula yeah and the formula is

1:08:48

article LinkedIn into groups 120 out of 3,000 people respond we take I want I

1:08:53

want integrate into that okay so so there's this signature piece of when

1:08:59

we're starting a business you need a signature piece of content that is the thesis why your business exists and yeah

1:09:04

you can chop and change that you can put that on landing pages you can put that around but you need a central place

1:09:10

where people go I Now understand this business because I've read that article um an enormous number of tech businesses

1:09:17

start with a white paper right so it's kind of like the business case it should

1:09:22

be Market facing that someone who is a potential buyer or customer or anyone in

1:09:27

general gets what you're up to because they've read that 500 to a th000 words worth content then there's content

1:09:33

marketing which is 3 to 20 posts a week that link back to the signature piece

1:09:38

yeah now the signature piece always has a call to action as to what you do next now you've read this what do you want me to do next well either join a waiting

1:09:46

list take an assessment drop me an email any of those sorts of things so this is all basically just kind of educating the

1:09:52

market this is what I'm up to as soon as someone showing some interest now we want to collect a lead and a qualified

1:09:58

lead at that so this is where we send them to the um the score card so the scorecard now by the way if you're on

1:10:05

point with all of your stuff you can actually run ads to the scorecard you can I I run $ 20,000 to $50,000 a month

1:10:12

worth of ads to our scorecards now um and they do convert and they we get leads for about $9 to12 per lead and we

1:10:19

end up average sale is $7 to $15,000 so you know and it's one in 66

1:10:26

who buy so we generate 66 leads for $700 and we

1:10:33

get $110,000 off the back of that so you know that's and that's just a machine

1:10:39

now um so ultimately and there's a different business right but um but

1:10:45

ultimately so we're now at the point of like wanting to have a lead generation engine and wanting to have qualified

1:10:50

leads coming through so now we can send content straight to the scorecard we can send people on direct messages to the

1:10:56

scorec card we can do ads to the scorecard any of that sort of stuff the landing page will actually have some of the thesis content um but we want it to

1:11:03

be brief we want the landing page to have like I don't know maybe 300 words maybe some T the landing page is the

1:11:10

landing page for scorecard the landing page for the individual's tailor made scorecard it's basically saying I want

1:11:17

you to take this scorecard and here's what you're going to get here's what your self-interest this is for your

1:11:23

benefit here's why you would this scorecard so let's say we're a strategy consultant it says is your strategy

1:11:30

ready for the times that we're in right is your business strategy ready for a post AI World answer 15 questions to

1:11:37

find out if your strategy is robust good okay so it's basically my opening document that goes with this scorecard

1:11:43

thing brilliant so I've I've I've got this thing that's been created because you've in introduced it into chat GPT

1:11:50

all the questions I would give me a head explosion and send me down a a path of um indecision

1:11:55

okay that's the truth okay overwhelming incision now it's very easy for me to we already wrote the prompts on the back

1:12:01

end yeah so we already know all the prompts okay so so this is all easy peasy now let's keep it really simple so

1:12:07

so these 30 people go into score app and out of the bottom of score app it's scoring everybody and the ones that have

1:12:12

got the scores that you want are the ones that you want to have on your Zoom yeah yeah right brilliant okay now if we

1:12:20

if we didn't if we didn't do that essentially we're encouraging unqualified people to come onto our our

1:12:26

Zoom who could be assassins they could be competive could

1:12:32

be problems okay so it's actually essential that we take that step because we want to qualify the lead qualified

1:12:37

leads and then we go into the qualified lead almost every business would be better having less but more qualified lead yeah absolutely yeah okay if if my

1:12:44

if my wealth managers sat in front of five red hot qualified people a week versus 10 okay that grow

1:12:51

exponentially they wouldn't know what to do with themselves okay they be happy as a you know B okay so we've now got

1:12:59

this SC we've got these people on this Zoom okay now we've got to presenter on Zoom yeah uh well with the score the one

1:13:05

thing I will say is this artificial intelligence uh chat gbt and all of that sort of stuff it's really good to use a

1:13:12

bakery example it's really good at creating sponge cake but don't forget to ice the cake so when someone buys a cake

1:13:19

they buy it based on the icing mhm they expect the sponge cake to be there but the icing is what sells it the chat gbt

1:13:26

stuff it's going to do all the questions it's going to do the landing page content the dynamic results all that sort of stuff I see the cake is putting

1:13:33

your photo on it putting your case studies your testimonials on it um making sure that the colors match up

1:13:40

with the colors that you've chosen for your other websites um making it look pretty making it look credible you know

1:13:48

sometimes I wonder whether a lot of business owners have the ability to imagine what it's like to not be them

1:13:55

because I sit there and I go your business looks like if I don't know who you are your business doesn't look very

1:14:01

appealing right this is sponge cake you know you got to ice the cake man you know this is no one's going to want to

1:14:06

buy sponge cake this is got it's got to look pretty so you know you do have to go like even though the AI does such a

1:14:13

phenomenal job of doing the content you got to dress it up you got to make sure it's looking good so you know I always

1:14:19

say that you can do six minutes to get a great score card with AI but spend the next 2 3 hours just asking some people

1:14:27

does is this clear do you understand why you taking this you know are you are you clear about my credibility you know I

1:14:33

used to work at accenta I should put that there you know I've done some work with uh you know sporting team I should

1:14:39

put that there I've got I got a testimonial from so and so let's put that testimonial there so just giving

1:14:45

that dressing that window dressing that's so important people don't have a lot of time so you need to just put the

1:14:50

icing on the cake so that is an important step and I just wanted to clarify that got it understood so we we

1:14:55

dress up now now the truth is if you don't have a great closing rate you are

1:15:02

still giving yourself a Fighting Chance of making sales if you got qualified leads if you got qualified leads so you

1:15:07

don't have to be the best salesman in the world okay remember you've polish yourself up doing the onet to ones okay

1:15:13

you still not may not be the greatest sales person but you got a much better chance of turning those people or some

1:15:18

of those people into clients wonderful okay so then this then then the next

1:15:24

question has to be I can scale that cuz it's just me to a

1:15:30

certain level but I've only got 100 hours in my working week so if every if

1:15:35

every call is an hour then you know we know what my limitations are yeah how how would do I then because I'm now

1:15:41

feeling confident feeling good I'm feeling really good about this I'm making some sales I know what I do well I know what I do badly we've got

1:15:47

qualified leads coming in okay the trouble now I've got is that number one I got to make the sales but number two

1:15:53

I've got to fulfill this as well well so what what's my next step in this journey

1:15:58

you know what what have I got to now start Outsourcing well you do you do need a team sometimes you Outsource

1:16:04

people you know to other suppliers but you do need a core team I'm a big fan of military examples I love Sport and I

1:16:11

love military examples for business the you know in a sporting example you would

1:16:16

never run onto the pitch with one person and say when I start kicking goals I'll

1:16:21

get another 10 people right you run onto the pitch with the team that you need um

1:16:27

a military example is that they I love this example the military if they're

1:16:32

curious about something they send a twers scout team to scout it in business I send because I now got a bigger

1:16:38

business if I've got an idea I send a two person scout team one person's job is can we sell it one person's job is

1:16:44

can we deliver it and they just conduct some experiments and find out on the side whether that's possible that's our

1:16:50

first little thing we're doing then the military has what's called a fire team a fire team is do one focused urgent thing

1:16:58

that needs to be done now um a launch campaign a little sales campaign right

1:17:03

so that's a four-person fire team um perfect for launching event perfect for

1:17:08

showing up at a trade show and meeting some clients perfect for going out to a new location and launching a new little

1:17:14

mini campaign to see if we can open up in Berlin whatever right so a four-person fire team uh in the military

1:17:21

an 8ers section has a Corporal at Lance corpal and people on the team that is

1:17:26

the most stable unit it's the bricks that build up the entire British and American Military uh the US call them

1:17:33

squads the military in the in Britain call them um sections so these little

1:17:38

sections of eight I have built my whole empire on putting together a section of eight as soon as possible so as soon as

1:17:45

I know that this business is going to be for real we've gone from two person scout team four person launch fire team

1:17:51

eight person section and I've got two people who run it one person sells and delivers one person delivers got six

1:17:58

people who are doing either sales operations delivery media content whatever it is that's my most stable

1:18:04

unit next size up is actually called a platoon and this is about 30 people so for me personally when I'm scaling teams

1:18:10

I'm going 2 4830 and that's how I'm scaling a team and I do it as fast as I can as as long as the market is telling

1:18:16

me this business is ready to go we're going 24830 okay I know this is important things this is brilliant this

1:18:23

is brilliant couple of important things here number one up until the time that they spend money on score app they haven't spent a penny

1:18:29

not really no and score app's free for the first 10 leads anyway yeah so and they have even including score up then

1:18:34

they haven't really spent a lot of money this this is really insignificant amounts to get going in business and if

1:18:39

you're if you're on a score plan it's 50 bucks a month or something like that that's if you're generating hundreds of Ls and then you LinkedIn Sal Navigator

1:18:47

it's not expensive all this stuff it's relatively cheap you haven't got to buy bags of stock you know there there's there's a Time investment yeah yeah okay

1:18:54

so effective we've done that and we've got to that point now we're going into this stage of scaling the 246 brilliant

1:19:00

the military thing I like that a lot and it's but I know there's some people that are watching right now going to go yeah

1:19:07

it's all right for you danad but you know how hard it is to find good people it's like finding needle in hay stacks

1:19:12

and I'm telling you I've tried my best to find good people and they just let me down and most people are well I'm not

1:19:18

even going to say what they are but yeah they I can't rely on them so so how do you how have you been managed to do that well for starters you're not you're

1:19:23

never going to get good people not at the early stage you're a tiny little startup you need people who can breathe that's all my when I've been starting my

1:19:30

businesses over the last 20 years my criteria as to whether I'll hire you on the team or not is will you

1:19:37

join that's my criteria if you're willing to join my team you're on the team because your mindset was I'm just

1:19:45

grateful that you're interested in talking to me man you you're alive and you've got time on your hands and you're going to come along and actually say

1:19:51

that you're going to join my team I launched multi-million dollar business with Spotty teenagers with friends and

1:19:58

girlfriends uh you know like it's kind of like robbing a bank right robbing a

1:20:04

bank if you think about how people rob banks you I I I don't know firsthand experience but I've seen enough Netflix

1:20:10

they get the gang together they have pizza and beer and they have a little Matchbox car in a Lego building and they

1:20:16

go all right so and they got their watch and they're like okay a 10:01 the guards change we're going to drive up here and

1:20:22

this going to have and they and they figure it all out and they and then there's the part where they role playay it right they they go into this like

1:20:28

abandoned shed and they like have the chalk outline and they kind of role playay it through that's how great

1:20:34

that's actually how great companies start that's what that's what we do so we get together anyone who will anyone

1:20:40

who possibly we can get together with and we say let's do sales roleplay let's see let's let's write some content and

1:20:47

see what we think about it and like let's see how if we had to get to a million in our first year how would we

1:20:53

do it would would we do it with 2,000 subscribers would we do it with three big clients would we do it with 30

1:21:00

midsize clients like what are we doing to get to our first million so we we brainstorm and we roleplay and all this

1:21:06

sort of stuff um I have found uh some of the best people I've ever worked with uni you know graduates

1:21:14

no experience they're you know they're looking for their first thing to cut their teeth on um people who've got um

1:21:22

kids and they need a lot of flexibility don't want to work they want to be able to drop the kids at school come to work

1:21:28

go pick the kids up from school right all of that sort of stuff people who want to do something a little bit on the weekend or evenings so I'm just looking

1:21:35

for anyone I can rope in to the team in the early days because I've got no credibility no one's going to quit their

1:21:40

job at Google to come and work for my startup right the idea that you're going to get good people

1:21:46
