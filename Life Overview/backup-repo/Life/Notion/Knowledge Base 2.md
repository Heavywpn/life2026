    - **1. Clippings, Capture, Inboxes & Using Save To Notion**
        1. Option 1: add a reference manually you can use the ‘New Clipping’ button on the main home screen.
        2. Option 2 (recommended): Install [Save To Notion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-notion) as an extension in either Chrome or Microsoft Edge
            - Create a custom form for the and you can auto clip and send page highlights directly to the database from your browser. Watch the Life OS Tour Video for more instructions.
        3. Anything labelled ‘New Clipping’ or with ‘No Knowledge Status’ will stay in the inbox view.
        4. To make it disappear from the Inbox, Simply set its Knowledge Status to any other status or add it to an Area or Resource in the Area/Resource Column.
            - ‘Live & Consuming’ if for references you are using
            - ‘On Reading List’ is for references you are wanting to look at in the future
            - ‘Bibliography of Inspiration’ is for anything you have consumed, but want to keep in the system for reference later.
            - ‘Archive’ hides the reference from all views and you can find it in the [[P.A.R.A Dashboard 2]] of the [[P.A.R.A Dashboard 2]]
    - **2. Make Meaningful Connections**
        
        This is what a second brain is all about! More connections = more value returned in your work!
        
        1. link you knowledge references to other databases to create connections. You can choose to link a clipping to:
            - [[Projects 2]]
            - _Projects (if you have added the Bundle Template)_ to see them returned to you on the relevant project pages.
            - [[Contacts 2]] contacts
            - Your own Notes in the that can be viewed on the [[Notebooks 2]] Dashboard.
            - Pages - Resources are like wider filters for materials and references
            - You Can also link Resources to Areas too - for more links and associations.
        2. You can also link references from other databases in the same way. If you are writing a Note in your [[Notebooks 2]] - link the knowledge to it from there. If you are working on a Project in the [[Projects 2]] Dashboard or the - add clippings and knowledge in the filtered project pages and they are automatically linked! Great for research and creative processes.
    - **3. Go Further With A Readwise-to-Notion Integration**
        - What is this?
            
            1. Signing up to Readwise allows you to send highlights and clippings from various browsers and reading devices to a single Readwise database. From here you can export everything into Noiton (in this case the - and thus create links and connections to your work. Notably: Readwise is great for:
                - Kindle Highlights & Notes
                - Saved Twitter Threads and Tweets
                - Podcast Clippings from Apps like [Airr.io](http://Airr.io) or Snipd
                - Anything highlighted and quoted or noted in the Readwise Reader or Instapaper.
            2. When you Sync Readwise to Notion it creates a new Database in Notion called ‘Readwise’. It auto creates a series of columns including ‘Category’ such as book, article, video, podcast etc, and other Readwise specific columns such as number of highlights, last highlighted and last synced.
            3. This it the Readwise Guide to How it Works: [https://help.readwise.io/article/46-how-does-the-readwise-to-notion-export-integration-work](https://help.readwise.io/article/46-how-does-the-readwise-to-notion-export-integration-work)
            
            Please Note - Integrating this into the template will require significant knowledge of Notion as you will essentially have to replace and recreate all the relations, [[Knowledge Base 2]] and [[P.A.R.A Dashboard 2]] Database Template Views of the with the new Readwise one. ==**So only do this if you are happy to take the risk.**== I recommend keeping a second version of the template in case.
            
        - Overview: Merging The Readwise Database with this Life OS Template:
            
            This is the tricky bit. If you would like to integrate Readwise with this Notion Life OS template - you will need to do the following.
            
            1. Create the Readwise Database as above Following the Instructions from Readwise here:[https://help.readwise.io/article/46-how-does-the-readwise-to-notion-export-integration-work](https://help.readwise.io/article/46-how-does-the-readwise-to-notion-export-integration-work)
                - Move the Readwise Database To The System Toggle next To the
            
              
            
            1. If you have yet to use the
                
                - You will recreate she same Relations in Your Life OS with the new Readwise Database including:
                    - Projects Database
                    - Notes Database
                    - Contacts Database
                    - Areas & Resources Database
                    - Creative OS Database*
                
                If you already have content in the :
                
                - The same process applied, but first you will need to change the existing relations into text columns, and then change them back so that relations to exiting pages are not lost.
                - merge the content to the Readwise Database, and then reconnect those Relation columns back into _relations._ This means you keep your existing relations already created.
                
                  
                
            2. From here you will finally need to
                
                - Recreate all Dashboard views and filtered Database Template views. It it possible that you can simply change the database source - but it is likely better **to create a new database view below the existing one and then copy the filtering and sorting** Changes will include (!)
                    - The Main Knowledge Hub views
                    - New Project Template
                    - All New Creative OS Project Templates (Video / Podcast / Freelance Contract etc etc)
                    - New Area Template Views
                    - New Resources Template Views
                    - The Knowledge / Clippings Inbox views
                
                1. Finally any Web-clipping Buttons (automations) Need to be amended to act with new Database.

        - Full Transfer / Readwise Integration Guide
            
            If you wish to continue: here are some further more detailed instructions on the process - do this at your own risk! 😂
            
            - **Stage 1: Connect Readwise & Prepare to Connect the Life OS**
                
                - [ ] Connect Readwise to your Notion account on the Readwise site under Exports
                    
                    ![[Screenshot_2022-02-14_at_11.51.40.png]]
                    
                - [ ] It will generate a new Database called Readwise where new highlights can be imported by Readwise automatically and will synchronise with Notion 🔁
                - [ ] I have set this version of your up to have matching columns + my additional functions. To transfer content across first check that the the **Category** column Tags in the New Readwise Tab match the one in this database in colour, name and order by: Changing the to match the Readwise database Tags.
                
                ![[Screenshot_2022-02-14_at_11.58.42.png]]
                
                  
                
                - [ ]
            - **Stage 2: Moving or Creating Relations**
                
                - [ ] If you don’t have any entries in your Knowledge Database Yet; Recreate the relations in your Knowledge Database in The Readwise Database (make sure to label them as e.g. ‘Projects - Readwise’ so you can tell the difference.
                    - [ ] Projects Database
                    - [ ] Notes Database
                    - [ ] Contacts Database
                    - [ ] Areas & Resources Database
                    - [ ] Creative OS Database*
                
                If you have existing entries setup in your Knowledge Hub You need to take a different approach.
                
                **The Next Steps are for if you have content already in the Life OS:**
                
                - [ ] Create a couple of test entries in the that each have a relation to one of the other databases filled in. When you send these entries to Readwise it will create the Relation columns as Text columns. Relations to to be moved across will be:
                    - Projects Database
                    - Notes Database
                    - Contacts Database
                    - Areas & Resources Database
                    - Creative OS Database*
                
                - [ ] Turn all the Relation Columns of your to **Text** Properties (don’t worry - you won’t loose the links - they just become backlinks for now)
                    
                    ![[Screenshot_2022-02-14_at_11.53.11.png]]
                    
                - [ ] Add any new columns from this Database not in the Readwise Database, alternatively - make sure every column of the first entry you will send across is populated and this will automatically add the extra columns to the new Readwise database. Great! This will happen with the next step:
                - [ ] Now test transfer an entry across ensuring there is something in each column that isn’t part of the Readwise Database. Do this by selecting it, clicking on the 6-dot menu of the entry on the left of the title in and click ‘Move To’ and search for the Readewise Database. Send it.
                    
                    ![[Screenshot_2022-02-14_at_12.06.03.png]]
                    
                - [ ] Check the data transferred and the Readwise Database has all the columns from The existing Knowledge Database. If it has. you can choose to send any further entries across at your own risk.
                - [ ] Once everything is added, Turn the ‘relation’ columns in the new Readwise Database that are currently **text** columns back into relations by selecting Relation in the column property list and searching for the databases to link them. You will now see the links in these text boxes turn back to relations.
            - **Stage 3: Fix & Recreate The Dashboard & Database Template Views.**
                
                The Readwise Database is now your new Knowledge Database, but you don’t yet have filtered and linked database views of that database through the rest of the system. These include (!)
                
                - The Main Knowledge Hub views
                - New Project Database Template/s
                - New Area Template Views
                - New Resources Template Views
                - The Knowledge / Clippings Inbox views
                - All New Creative OS Project Templates (Video / Podcast / Freelance Contract etc etc) if you have the Creative OS bundle.
                - Finally any Web-clipping Buttons (automations) Need to be amended to act with new Database.
                
                  
                
                - [ ] First go to the [[Knowledge Base 2]] page and re create the dashboard views using ‘/ table view’ , selecting the Readwise database and **copying my existing layouts, filters and sorts** - you can easily select Gallery, List view etc as needed.
                - [ ] Do the same with the Inbox view on the main home page. This is in a Synced Block - so will update elsewhere too.
                - [ ] Next Go to the [[Projects 2]] Dashboard and edit the New Project Database Templates you have there in the same way by clicking on the arrow next to ==NEW,== selecting the ‘…’ on the template and then selecting ‘Edit’==.== Here you Can repeat the process above, copying my exiting ‘ / Table Views’ in the template, but with the new Readwise Database as the source.
                    - [ ] Please note: Remember to set the filter for the database view to be where related is the page you are on ‘New Project TEMPLATE’ for example.
                    - [ ] Once done - you can delete the old database view.
                - [ ] Next, Go to The and update the ‘New Area Database’ Template and the ‘New Resource’ Database Template in the same way
                - [ ] Finally, if you have the - Do the same here with each of the Creative Project Templates:
                    - [ ] New Video
                    - [ ] New Short Reel
                    - [ ] New Podcast
                    - [ ] New Product
                    - [ ] New Freelance Contract
                    - [ ] Don’t forget to delete the old database view here.
                
                  
                
                If you Already had linked Knowledge in other Database Views
                
                Unfortunately - you won’t have these new views in existing database pages. The best bet here is to:
                
                - [ ] copy any important information in the page (not in a linked database) to else where (text images)
                - [ ] Delete everything on the page and the reapply the new template you updated earlier. This will reinstate everything, and then you can paste the text / images above back where you need them
                
            - **Stage 4: Update Buttons & Automations**
                
                Finally any Web-clipping Buttons (automations) need to be amended to act with new Database.
                
                This is super simple:
                
                - [ ] click on the edit cog next to the button
                - [ ] change the selected database to the Readwise Database.
                - [ ] Test it!
            - **Stage 5: Clean Up & Finishing**
                
                - [ ] The last thing to do is to Rename The Readwise Database as your ‘Knowledge Database’
                - [ ] IMPORTANT: Remove & RENAME the old one -otherwise you may accidentally link new clipping to it - for example - if you use Save To Notion
                - [ ] Finally - remember to create a new Clipping button for this new database in Save To Notion if you are using it.
