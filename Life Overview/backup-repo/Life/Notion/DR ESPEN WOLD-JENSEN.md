a massive part of healing because that's when you're holding on to that negative energy and emotion and you're just like in that victimhood where you're blaming this person that wronged you and if that's in your body it's lowering your frequency and and disrupting your healing so all of that to say it's in the science it's in the research clinical data the people who don't heal are holding on to negative emotion and it's it's a necessary part of [Music] healing greetings and welcome to the Dr Espen podcast I am Espen today I am a privileged to have a conversation with a person that has put together some works that I believe has truly changed the way we understand health and healing uh Kelly nun garez has been in the health uh game and in the Consciousness game for many many years and today we're going to have a conversation revolving how we can improve our health expand our Consciousness and take as I say our energy frequency and vibration to a whole new level so let me start the official introduction I'm really I'm excited about where this can go today uh Kelly gz is an entrepreneur she's a writer director and producer she gained recognition for her award-winning documentary heel they came out out in 2017 I'm sure many of you would have seen that highlights these nine different steps of health and healing that I honestly believe that without that you're not going to be able to obtain Optimal Health so we're going to talk a little bit about these principles today and we're going to talk about some very simple very inexpensive yet remarkably powerful steps that you can take right now to improve the health and and the overall well-being for you and for the whole family so that heel movie came out in 2017 uh and it explores the Mind Body connection this is very important the the Mind Body Connection the psychosomatic aspect of our own health and well-being and our body's natural capabilities to heal all right and then in 2019 she came out with the book heel and now she's got the podcast as well which we'll talk a little bit about now for heel specifically I remember I was watching this and I was saying to Kelly just before we jumped on I was just covered in truth bumps watching this because I was uh really quite uh grateful that someone had put together a a compilation of such amazing works I mean that included from from memory we had deepack Choo we had Bruce Lipton in there uh we had a lot of experts around the world that came together Maron Williamson was in there um and shared about their understanding of Health um Kelly's born and raised in La she's been traveling all over the world been in the industry uh of entertainment she since she was 7 years old she's on the environmental and sustainability board uh of at UCLA to help healing the planet and the list goes on and on and on Kelly I as I said I'm excited to have this conversation I want to say special welcome to the podcast how are you today thank you I'm doing well so I'm excited to hang out and chat let's do it okay so the topics we could discuss you know spirituality Consciousness healing all that sort of stuff I want to ask firstly what inspired you to get thought leaders in the so called alternative medicine holistic medicine field together and not just some of them but I think Dr Michael Beckwith was in there you got some of the leading experts in the world in this field together in this movie heel what inspired you to put together that yeah it's a lifelong journey so there's no one like aha that made me go I need to make this film But ultimately you know all of the teachers in the film empowered me to understand that we have way more power over our health and our lives and we've kind of been led to believe you know and I don't think there any like Sinister Force that's like leading us down the wrong path but just the way society and systems have evolved kind of you know we give our power away and so when I started learning about quantum physics and energy and Law of Attraction and you know just deepening my spiritual understanding and I just was like oh my gosh everybody needs to know this and then and I read the biology of belief by Bruce Lipton which is explores epigenetics which basically tells us that our genes are just a blueprint our DNA uh a blueprint of potentials you know and then our environment and our perception of the environment which means our subconscious programming beliefs color the lens and actually uh turn toggle on and off jeans so we have that's kind of like in spiritual terms in scientific terms free will that we can choose whether we want to turn on the good jeans or the bad jeans Etc so when I learned that I was like oh my gosh everybody needs to know this and I essentially you know people would come up to me and say why are you so happy how are you manifesting all this stuff what do you eat what do you do what's your workout and I was like I've just got to put all my teachers that empowered me into a film and and so became he and there we are so ladies gentlemen if you haven't seen heel I think it's on Netflix as well Kelly is that correct it was on Netflix for two years we've been on Amazon Prime now for a couple years so yeah yeah the Amazon Prime comes out with big budgets don't they okay so jump on Amazon Prime and and watch the movie heel and as I did many many years ago I think this is what 2019 I watched it and I was like yes yes yes yes and I kind of did an audit of my personal life you know if we talk about nutrition herbs and spices talk about emotional healing which I'd like to talk to in a moment I've specialized in in clearing in emotional buckes and how that has affected the body so I want to get into that but I basically used the the documentary not only as inspiration but also as a checklist and I went through and I audited my life and I looked at it and I thought and I asked myself where am I not in in in full you know potential with these different topics and it actually gave me a really good blueprint to take my energy to the next level so I'd like to talk a little bit about this this healing aspect because I know that you're really big on this and I've also specialized in this and I'd love your take it we talk about stress mental physical spiritual emotional and chemical stress but as we know it's one of the few if not the only thing that's related to every single chronic disease that we can see so if we understand stress from today's aspect most people are living in fight or flight how bad and or dangerous is it really for us to live in fight or flight yeah it's detrimental to our health and vitality and Longevity ultimately because we are you know just to take it down to very rudimentary terms our nervous system is either in fight ORF flight which is meant to make us superum to either hunt for our food or you know fight Flee for our lives so it's this you know stress response that makes us very strong focused energized but it's only meant to be turned on for that survival period of either either escaping a predator uh or an enemy or you know going after our food so it's a survival thing you know back in the day it's turned on for a short period of time so we can you know survive and then it's meant to be turned off and the other side of that is the parasympathetic nervous system response and that's when we're resting we're basically healing resting rejuvenating and and restoring all of our body systems so if we are in fight or flight chronically which is what is happening in the state of the world with the inundation of a 24-hour news cycle we have not evolved quickly enough to keep up with this inundation with in information most of it negative and fear inducing fear inciting stressful um and violent and just dark we haven't evolved to to be able to process that amount of information so that's putting us in these like kind of chronic stress response Cycles which just in a very logical sense we cannot rest and repair and do all these things that our body needs to do to process the toxins in our environment to rest in repair and to do all the things that was designed to do and that's what's hindering that's what's you know one of the main issues of why we have this chronic illness epidemic yes there's toxins yes there's all sorts of you know bad food and processed food and all these things that are contributing to that but at the very minimum if we're not able to rest and repair we're just we're going down with the ship and so that's that stresses everything I mean it's really the basis of why we're all conically ill today it's interesting as you mention that because I've had the privilege of owning 10 multi-disciplinary health clinics and hiring and recruiting and managing a lot of different you know chiropractors naturopaths medical doctors and dentists over the years and if we were to really survey all of our patients and ask what is the core problem what is it that links every one together in terms of pathology and disease it would defin Ely be stressed yet it seems that many people are Their Own Worst Enemy we tend to be on the treadmill of life and in the rat race and not stop until we either one get that this is actually very detrimental or two we have a scare a health scare or something so just urging those out there to kind of tune in to where your nervous system might be at right now are you in fight or flight I mean speaking from experience I've had adrenal fatigue and burnout three times as an entrepreneur trying to you know get to that next stage or whatever and it is remarkably painful and it's better to take charge on your health and wellbeing now and I know Kelly you've been a vivid meditator and and and and and uh practicer of these tools for many years so just for everyone watching and listening what is your relationship to stress how are you mastering your life your emotions and your stress levels by taking time out nurturing yourself eating clean meditating um journaling praying whatever it is that you're doing so I'd love to give you little tips and tools and accountability measures throughout the podcast so you can just right away take control on your health Kelly you know what something that you've spoken about I really love your opinion on and we're going to get to the whole expansion of consciousness conversation soon I'm just itching and excited but before we do I want to talk about emotions okay this is so big in the movie heal and it's not the only work that you've done I love it and by the way we'll talk about Kelly's podcast soon you got to go check out this podcast and you obviously got to go watch the the movie as well but in the movie here there's there's a specific link and you talk about negative emotions and unres olved trauma I call them issues in the tissues from your experience can you tell me what what effect does negative emotions and unresolved trauma have on both one our health and two our quality of life please I mean it all ties back to stress so if we have a lot of us are not given the tools to process trauma and deep pain in the moment so what we do our body goes into shock and kind of we repress and suppress that intense emotion it's the feeling the energy of the feeling is too painful too terrifying you know whatever that trauma was that occurred we aren't we don't have the capacity to process it in the moment so that energy gets stored somewhere in the body and that disrupts flow that disrupts life force energy Chi whether it's the chakra system or traditional Chinese medicine all of these ancient wisdom it all goes back to the same thing it's a blockage of energy in the body body so it gets stored in your issues really do get stored in the tissues which then blocks energy when you don't have that energy flow and vitality you know things manifest into disease and physical the physical is always the last place that it will show up and express so I always go back and I love you know because I yes I'm very spiritual I'm very woooo but you've got to be based in science and I think that we're at a time in history where spirituality is kind of being demonstrated and proven through science so it's very exciting in the film there's a researcher named Dr Kelly Turner who her research is specifically tied to cancer which has a you know very like clear emotional route many of the times um and there's you know over 200 causes of cancer cancer is a very complex chronic disease but she researched all of like 1500 cases of spontaneous healing radical remission because when they were doing her she was doing her research she was like wait these like anomalies that they just keep tossing to the side of these people that healed were sent home to die and then all of a sudden they're not dead 20 years later from an you know they had Pancreatic Cancer all these incurable cancers she's like we should be studying them we shouldn't be discounting them as anomalies we should be studying what they did so she studied 1,500 cases and found out that all of these people who were sent home to dive of terminal incur you know air quotes incurable Cancer all did nine things this was at the point when the film came out now she added movement because she went back and looked at a research and they all did some sort of movement most of it was like walking but it was like walking or yoga so there's movement in there so the other nine things um two of them were physical which is radically changing your diet and using herbs and supplements and the other seven uh were mental emotional and and spiritual and that blew me away Kelly when I saw the movie I'm like I'm expecting the nutrition and a bit of movement and a bit of that and I'm like two out of nine is physical and I remember I wrote it down and I'm like what is going on and now we get to go deep so back to you this is exciting yeah and you're an energy guy so you get this like it's so much easier to shift the energy than to shift the matter and the matter is the diet and the the herbs and supplements um and the movement obviously shifts energy too but so one of them is is clearing and releasing negative emotions one of them is increasing positive emotions so emotions again is energy and motion it's feeling it's energy so so she just learned that they they all did some form of trauma healing and forgiveness and another expert in the film Joan Boris senko all of these experts have been doing this kind kind of holistic approach to healing and holistic is not woooo holistic is looking at the body as a whole system and not just like attacking you know one area and not realizing that it's connected to all the other systems of the body so like you give a pill for organ or system a it's going to throw there's going to be a downward consequence it's going to throw off the other system so it's like you have to look at the human body as a whole system in it everything's you know interconnected so anyways all of that to say Joan Bor senko said she was running since the like early 80s a a holistic Cancer Clinic and she said the ones who didn't heal 100% of the time were all holding on to regrets or resentments which is why forgiveness is such a massive part of healing because that's when you're holding on to that negative energy and emotion and you're just like in that victim Ood where you're blaming this person that wronged you and you're just a if that's in your body it's lowering your frequency and and disrupting your healing so all of that to say it's in the science it's in the research clinical data that people who don't heal are holding on to negative emotion and it's it's a necessary part of you I feel this is a microp moment I just want to take this opportunity to kind of let listeners and viewers kind of tune into that what are you holding on to what resentment judgment bitterness um regret guilt shame anger are you holding on to and the old expression I think it's pertinent here you know um being angry and Andor experiencing these emotions is like drinking poison and expecting someone else to be affected by it um there are methods there are tools there are amazing resources such as Kell's work and heel and and her podcast and some of the work that I do they can actually help you with this they can actually help you take a good look in the mirror and and realize that as I teach life never happened to you it always happened for you so I want to share a hypothesis with you Kelly because this is just mindboggling I U graduated 20 209 and retired 2016 I was burnt out I was unhappy um I was very corporately successful but I was sick and I was say mostly emotionally sick because I had not taken or given myself the opportunity to heal the unresolved troll in my body and in my mind from childhood my brother passed away my sister was disabled and that was difficult both my parents are alcoholics and so on and so forth and so I realized then that hang on you know so much of how we experience life is unconscious or subconscious and so I did what some people would do I just retired from clinical practice I had a lot of money I went to Peru I started drinking iasa and some other things it's been a very interesting Journey since my point being I remember once I was sitting in the jungle in Peru and I experienced this blue light this colar around my throat and when I tuned into my life I realized that there were some things in my life that I wasn't resonating with anymore there were people that I uh wasn't right for me to be in a relationship with there were things that I had been doing that wasn't right for me anymore and then as I started to study this to understand myself I came about an ancient blueprint from the Indian lineage and the bagita and the yoga Traditions um that showed that certain emotions block the different energy sent all the chakras and at the time I was a you know I had three degrees in science and I looked at it and I thought this is a bit woo woo isn't it but because I had some experience in yoga and and my intuition pulled me and I know you're big on intuition I started researching this and then I realized that fear and this is again the blueprint I didn't discover this I just kind of put the pieces together fear blocks the root Energy Center the first chakra guilt blocks the second shame blocks the third grief blocks the fourth lies block the fifth and so on and so forth so I thought to myself what if there's something in this so what I did is I wrote a curriculum it's called Quantum Advanced and it takes three days and we go through the clearing process and what we do is we help people identify their primary fear their greatest fear and then turn it into something productive from Fear to fuel and then we go through guilt and we can clear guilt we go through shame and we can clear shame um and and what happens over time is that there is this change of of how we hold our internal energy and I have to agree with what you said before because then our students and the people going through this they don't feel like drinking alcohol or eating crap food because they feel so great and often what we realize is that these vices these addictions come from not feeling good so I want to I want to ask you firstly have you uh what's your understanding let's go a little bit deeper into energy centers chakras and emotional imbalances as such and your uh I I guess experience in the effects on the body specifically what are your thoughts yeah I mean I I totally I've never heard the emotional blocks like You' you've put them so I'm like I need to go through your three-day program there's all sorts of healing in my chart which is not shocking right but I didn't know that before I did heal um all I know is that I seek truth I want to understand this like insatiable desire to understand the way things work so I've done every like healing you know mod ality and I continue to find things and then I experience them and I share them so that other people can you know find but you know I recently did a plant medicine journey and there was this and the the woman the shaman took me through this like mirror work and we connect I like went through and this wasn't what she was you know intending but the experience that I had is I I looked and saw in the mirror me between the ages of like 12 and 14 and I had like completely disconnected at that time from this part of me you know and I'm like look and I'm like thinking like was there something traumatic that happened that caused this disassociation or this disconnect but anyways the amount of healing that occurred by just witnessing and it was something I wasn't conscious of but there was just this like point in my life where I just kind of disconnected with a a part of myself and so in that time I reconnected to myself and like the amount of energy I have since that moment it was like there's just so many things that happen in our life that disconnect us you know and I'm not being very articulate but as you're talking about the chakras is like there's blocks there's fragments and for me it's just like all healing is wholeness it's it's coming back to your whole self and so part you know it's energy it's it's trauma it's you know and it's something that we do on our own but sometimes we need these facilitators and these you know exogenous you know experiences that can reflect back where we've just kind of disconnected from ourselves if that Mak makes sense and so yeah I think this is an important point because you know if you and I say this to my students sometimes imagine this you go uh online to your you know AI tool or just Google or whatever and you you look up what percentage of my atoms are made up of empty space and the answer scientifically proven since MOX plunk won the Nobel Prize for this over 100 years ago is 99 plus per empty space so we are made up of 99% pure untapped energy potential so the fact that we're playing at this very surface level of healing equals physical means that we're playing with less than 1% of our true healing potential just scientifically proven so I just want to point out what Kelly is speaking about here is not woo woo this is actual science it may feel woooo and it certainly did to me many years ago but this journey has been one of the greatest discoveries of my life and so I want to go a little bit deeper into this because now we're talking about understanding energy and Consciousness understanding who we really are and I think a useful tool that I've shared with my students is asking the question who am I in the first place and so then most people would say I am energy I am Consciousness I am matter I am spirit I am Source whatever and we know that scientifically true and so then it's not just that we are the body or the mind we are The Observers of the body and the mind and as such then we can change anything within that realm this puts the power back in our reality and and often you know students if they say that they go through healing let's say that we talk about regret like Kelly brought up before and we have regret because we heard someone or we lied to someone or someone deceived us or hurt us if we hold on to that we know that we're going to get sick all right we heard the results from do Turner's work earlier with the psychosomatic aspect of this but I think when people uh when we give ourselves permission to remember who we are as in I am Consciousness then life didn't happen to us it happened for us we are experiencing this reality we are not the sickness we are experiencing signs and symptoms of disease that doesn't mean we are sick there's a very big difference okay so I just wanted to put that out there because if you know who you are as in I am you know Consciousness well you have every tool in the entire toolbox to change your life how exciting okay Kelly let's talk Consciousness is interesting I mean we've been through Co we've been through a lot of crazy things uh and I think that the darker the dark the brighter the light what are your thoughts on the expansion uh and the evolution of human consciousness what's happening now on a collective level I believe we're like experiencing a breakdown before a breakthrough if that makes sense so it feels like it feels like there is an energy I don't you know there's the age of Aquarius that we're stepping into there's the frequency of the earth like all yeah it's like it's I I'm feeling all of it I'm witnessing all of it and systems are breaking down there's there's a lot of inflammation uh in society in the global Collective right so and and just and the way we're treating the planet like all of these systems and and our and our mentality and our kind of cons you know rabid consumption is it's not none of this is sustainable so to me I believe like you said the darker the dark the lighter the light I I and I believe in physics it's like there's an equal and opposite reaction in spirituality so as as much as there's and it's been throughout time and throughout history so you know with when there's this kind of negative Bend to what we're experiencing witnessing there's also just this equal and opposite it's just that's how the cosmos stay in Balance right I I don't know if I'm making any sense but to me it just feels like I'm watching a bad movie but with all that I've learned I can remove myself and as I'm looking I'm sitting in the mountains in Aspen Colorado and like there is so much Beauty still happening in the world and in N like nature just self-corrects we are part of nature so as I just encourage everybody to just kind of keep pulling back perspective keep opening the aperture it's so easy to get hooked especially with social media and everything else um into the negative but if we can just like breathe and pull back and it's you know it's a fine balance you want to be engaged you want to be an activist for things that are not just and things that are wrong in the world that you're passionate about however also it's like it's on us to be happy and present and grateful there's so much to be grateful for you know there's like so it's it's F you know it's on that individual level we're all healing like your podcast your work my work you there's just it's that equal and opposite for all the that's breaking down in the world and the systems and the corrupt politicians and you know pandemics and whatever like there's also so much Beauty and truly even though it seems super gnarly what's going on in the state of the world like we're doing we're like very blessed as a as a as a generation meaning technology like there's there's Wars there's suffering there's awful awful horrific things that happen every day but compared to like medieval times and to you know like we're and the Great Depression like we're doing okay you know so we're we just have to continue to you know be the change you wish to see in the world is probably one of the wisest things things that you could do it's like as we heal ourselves we are part of this Collective frequency right we are as we change our frequency we're sending out new information into the field collectively for all the people that are meditating for all the people that are doing the work that's expanding the energy in the field in the positive direction you know so I'm a you know I'm a hopeless Optimist but I'm I'm feeling good about this conversation and you know all of the people listening you know we're we're on the right side of History so I love that there's a lot of trust and faith in that and and I absolutely agree if you look back at the the past we are certainly living in very very blessed times and I think now speaking for myself it's a time to prepare and I'm not preparing from any aspect of fear or or worry or concern I'm preparing for an aspect of purifying my body because I do believe that we're entering higher states of consciousness and I do know that my vessel my body my temple must be able to hold and or assimilate these energies so I want to just quickly ask what are some of the top things that you're doing in your life right now to not just you know expand your own Consciousness and live a magical life I mean you're a mom you're a snowboarder you're you're an activist for amazing things to help the planet what are some of the things that you're focusing on now moving forward in your life yeah I love what you just said it's like we have to with this raise raising of the frequency you know I am held to more account to like this vessel you know because I'm so like I just came off of four days of a headache and and talking to other people it felt very like so like massive solar flares like my friend tracks the Schuman resonance meter and she was like this is going charts you know she like sending it to me I'm like what does this mean I don't know all I know is that I'm exhausted and I have a headache for no reason and why are they cutting out I mean you go back and you look at you follow the Schuman resonance you understand the what's happening with the waves of energy coming into the atmosphere but then it looks like they're cutting out parts of it there's certainly information bits of information missing so either they're missing it or they're hiding something it's interesting to see but we do know there's a lot of light entering the atmosphere I just wanted to put that in there back to you yeah so I mean so you're this is tracking with you because there was no reason why I should have a headache for four days that Advil and I don't I like it it pains me to take Advil like I'll take Advil on the third day of a headache and headaches debilitate me and with a 5-year-old it's like you can't you have to be able to function so I I think I took Advil like the end of the second day and it barely did anything and I'm just like this is like this is external this is not normal and and you know it was hormonal not to give too much information but it was like in line with my cycle but that's rare to have a headache and then there's this blue super moon full moon so all of that to say I think we as human beings these organisms were getting more sensitive and infiltrated with this raising of the frequency higher energy more light coming into the atmosphere whatever so we do have to be a little bit more diligent in our practices so that we can hold the space and I you know this may go a little too woooo or or real but I there's a lot of people not being able to sustain this frequency and they're choosing to leave the planet whether it's through overdose suicide it's like it is it's it's intensifying you know so even we're like we're pretty conscious and we're aware of what's going on and like I have to be I can't like I have to like drink less alcohol get more sleep you know I I just have to like do do better so that my my vessel can can handle it and it's it's it is and I'm just like you know the the uh rebellious teenager in me is like no I'm still young and I can handle this but it's like no I will like I can feel the shift so for me all of that to say my biggest thing is like of course I lean into my meditation practice but I just have to get closer to Nature like I think one of our biggest issues is disconnecting from disconnection from nature whether it's the cycles of sleep and light and dark and we're on this like unsustainable pace of life to keep up with the Joneses and be successful it's like no we need to go to sleep when the Sun goes down you know shortly therea we need to rise with the sun we need to eat seasonally in season and local all of that is making much more it has a lot more it's like we can't not do that anymore you know what I mean and getting my feet into the Earth um getting that early morning sun just being in the trees so that's my antidote right now is like getting into nature as much as possible H we are nature and so when we do wear rubber Souls all day we don't get sun on our skin we eat food like products rather than real food and we don't actually get to sit on the ground and and and you know breathe a meditate or Journal we are disconnected not only from our mother but from ourselves and I think this is extremely important to understand mother nature always corrects herself you mentioned that so beautifully Kelly and that means that we also have that innate intelligence to do just the same where are you not giving yourself mission to go out in nature and be still to to to you know swim in the oceans to to swim in the rivers to to do whatever this is extremely important I think really getting reconnected again with that 7.8 Herz frequency of the earth and when you're on the earth that that resonance will go through your beingness this is this is not anything new we know about this um so I'm I'm really excited about this and you've provided us with some really good insights to some very powerful tools um and of course guys you know go and check out the the movie heel and before we move on let me just do this right now this is this is for all you guys watching and listening pen and paper take a note firstly heal withth [ky.co](http://ky.co/) okay that's the website hewi [ky.co](http://ky.co/) o at Instagram it's heal with Kelly Allin one word that's Instagram heal with Kelly Allin one word and also Kelly gorz G RS so go and check out heel go and check out Kelly's work definitely jump on the podcast I would be delighted to jump on yours and have a deep dive whatever topic you want to go um but for now guys you're coming on you're for sure oh you're on okay it's on okay that I'm honored thank you um for now listeners and viewers use these resources to get inspired look at what in your life is not serving you anymore maybe put it to the side get out in nature and see what happens just give it 30 days and you'll notice a big change in yourself and and a perhaps even a reconnection to not only nature but also to Consciousness and spirit um Kelly I want to ask you um a couple of questions before we wrap up and I think this is one of the most important questions for me looking at my life what do you think now if we observe ourselves uh and we start to tune in you mentioned before when we change ourselves when we take care of ourselves on an individual level it's going to have an impact on the field all right so and I remember once I asked someone uh someone asked me excuse me you know what's going to happen in the world and my answer was if you asked that question you may not be a leader what do you think are some of the um decisions that we can make some of the standards maybe that we can apply in our lives to ensure that we're walking the right path uh into the into the future yeah I I think it's very important now especially with the rise of AI and the doctoring of images and just you know just capture of governments and big political machines and you know I'm not I'm not a conspiracy theorist I just like have learned a lot so you're realist think I get it yeah I'm a realist it's like yeah it's it's pretty lat at this day and age so I think you know one of the one of Kelly Turner's again this is her research from 10 years ago still applies today of those nine key Essentials to Healing now it's 10 with movement one of them is tapping into your intuition and I think the biggest thing right now is having practices so that you can tune in you the unique listener that there's never been anyone like you ever in the history and never in this moment in time right now you are a unique beautiful person that is here to share their gifts um and you have an internal guidance system that is directly from Source your higher self your soul whatever you want to call it constantly giving you guidance and Truth through the interpretation of this incredible mechanism called the human body that's why I think you said the cutest term I've ever heard with this truth bumps I've never heard that before we call them Goosebumps on this side of the hemisphere but like truth bumps so true it's like that is your body giving you guidance as a channel from the energy of your higher self so first and foremost the biggest thing that everybody can do right now is have tools and practices that connect you or or help you to hear understand and translate the voice of your intuition and the guidance so how do we do that I mean I think prayer meditation getting into this getting into the frequency of Nature and just sitting there in silence and being once you're observed by Nature you can you become a Clear Channel to source so your intuition becomes very loud in that silence and frequency of of the Perfection of nature nature meditation constantly I call it mental hygiene um which you know Marian Williamson speaks so beautifully about in the film you know we shower it's totally societally normal to shower our physical bodies off every day um it should be just as if not more important to shower our minds and the gunk and the residue and all the buildup we get from the stress of the day and the information we're taking on we need mental hydrant we need to to cleanse and release all of that you know buildup and and energetic plaque of our thoughts and all the stuff that we that just kind of clutters our mind every day in meditation I you know I love Transcendental Meditation because you use 20 minutes in the morning to set the tone and create the space so that you can deal with the day and then 20 minutes in the afternoon slash evening to let go and shower off all the gunk that you've accumulated in the day so so I just think you know those pract journaling in the morning gratitude gratitude is a frequency that um again just changes the flow and vitality like the the language of the universe is like love and that the language of nature is like gratitude and awe nature is just in awe of itself all the time it's an awe and just so grateful for its source for providing everything it needs to regenerate and and survive and and be and Thrive and just be beautiful so if we can tap into that frequency of awe and gratitude you know Journal meditate mental hygiene and then be in nature to tap into that higher um guidance that inner guidance from our source and our higher self I think that's what we need to uh be able to navigate the Rapids of the current times I remember that from watching heel the intuition part actually came in super strong and that's been something that I've observed not only in myself within my CL but also within my closer Circle those who are giving themselves time to be still to meditate to actually listen and I mean with with our senses multi- uh you know dimensional sensors more so than just the five or six if you include thought they are the ones that are able to find answers much faster so I love this conversation about intuition it's as if it's a a superpower innately given to us that many have forgotten or suppressed what would happen if we would activate the true part of the intelligence of that within ourselves and isn't it amazing that we all have the capacity to do so without paying a scent for it meditation is free hiking is free journaling is free and so on and so forth I love it Kelly okay sister I've got one last question for you straight off the cuff are you ready yep let's go so here's the question I want you to now man imagine um Kelly nunz you're on this world stage the entire world every sentient being alive has gathered they're watching they're listening and

Beauty in whatever form that we have shown up here in this lifetime at this time and so much more is possible than we've been led to believe once we tap into the intelligence the Beauty and the love that nature shows us and once we can connect to Source like we have access to infinite possibility like whatever you dream know that that dream is in you and in your Consciousness because in some possibility it is it's already happened so not only you were given that dream because you've were also given everything you need to see that dream realize then go beyond that stretch your mind beyond

a massive part of healing because that's when you're holding on to that negative energy and emotion and you're just like in that victimhood where you're blaming this person that wronged you and if that's in your body it's lowering your frequency and and disrupting your healing so all of that to say it's in the science it's in the research clinical data the people who don't heal are holding on to negative emotion and it's it's a necessary part of [Music] healing greetings and welcome to the Dr Espen podcast I am Espen today I am a privileged to have a conversation with a person that has put together some works that I believe has truly changed the way we understand health and healing uh Kelly nun garez has been in the health uh game and in the Consciousness game for many many years and today we're going to have a conversation revolving how we can improve our health expand our Consciousness and take as I say our energy frequency and vibration to a whole new level so let me start the official introduction I'm really I'm excited about where this can go today uh Kelly gz is an entrepreneur she's a writer director and producer she gained recognition for her award-winning documentary heel they came out out in 2017 I'm sure many of you would have seen that highlights these nine different steps of health and healing that I honestly believe that without that you're not going to be able to obtain Optimal Health so we're going to talk a little bit about these principles today and we're going to talk about some very simple very inexpensive yet remarkably powerful steps that you can take right now to improve the health and and the overall well-being for you and for the whole family so that heel movie came out in 2017 uh and it explores the Mind Body connection this is very important the the Mind Body Connection the psychosomatic aspect of our own health and well-being and our body's natural capabilities to heal all right and then in 2019 she came out with the book heel and now she's got the podcast as well which we'll talk a little bit about now for heel specifically I remember I was watching this and I was saying to Kelly just before we jumped on I was just covered in truth bumps watching this because I was uh really quite uh grateful that someone had put together a a compilation of such amazing works I mean that included from from memory we had deepack Choo we had Bruce Lipton in there uh we had a lot of experts around the world that came together Maron Williamson was in there um and shared about their understanding of Health um Kelly's born and raised in La she's been traveling all over the world been in the industry uh of entertainment she since she was 7 years old she's on the environmental and sustainability board uh of at UCLA to help healing the planet and the list goes on and on and on Kelly I as I said I'm excited to have this conversation I want to say special welcome to the podcast how are you today thank you I'm doing well so I'm excited to hang out and chat let's do it okay so the topics we could discuss you know spirituality Consciousness healing all that sort of stuff I want to ask firstly what inspired you to get thought leaders in the so called alternative medicine holistic medicine field together and not just some of them but I think Dr Michael Beckwith was in there you got some of the leading experts in the world in this field together in this movie heel what inspired you to put together that yeah it's a lifelong journey so there's no one like aha that made me go I need to make this film But ultimately you know all of the teachers in the film empowered me to understand that we have way more power over our health and our lives and we've kind of been led to believe you know and I don't think there any like Sinister Force that's like leading us down the wrong path but just the way society and systems have evolved kind of you know we give our power away and so when I started learning about quantum physics and energy and Law of Attraction and you know just deepening my spiritual understanding and I just was like oh my gosh everybody needs to know this and then and I read the biology of belief by Bruce Lipton which is explores epigenetics which basically tells us that our genes are just a blueprint our DNA uh a blueprint of potentials you know and then our environment and our perception of the environment which means our subconscious programming beliefs color the lens and actually uh turn toggle on and off jeans so we have that's kind of like in spiritual terms in scientific terms free will that we can choose whether we want to turn on the good jeans or the bad jeans Etc so when I learned that I was like oh my gosh everybody needs to know this and I essentially you know people would come up to me and say why are you so happy how are you manifesting all this stuff what do you eat what do you do what's your workout and I was like I've just got to put all my teachers that empowered me into a film and and so became he and there we are so ladies gentlemen if you haven't seen heel I think it's on Netflix as well Kelly is that correct it was on Netflix for two years we've been on Amazon Prime now for a couple years so yeah yeah the Amazon Prime comes out with big budgets don't they okay so jump on Amazon Prime and and watch the movie heel and as I did many many years ago I think this is what 2019 I watched it and I was like yes yes yes yes and I kind of did an audit of my personal life you know if we talk about nutrition herbs and spices talk about emotional healing which I'd like to talk to in a moment I've specialized in in clearing in emotional buckes and how that has affected the body so I want to get into that but I basically used the the documentary not only as inspiration but also as a checklist and I went through and I audited my life and I looked at it and I thought and I asked myself where am I not in in in full you know potential with these different topics and it actually gave me a really good blueprint to take my energy to the next level so I'd like to talk a little bit about this this healing aspect because I know that you're really big on this and I've also specialized in this and I'd love your take it we talk about stress mental physical spiritual emotional and chemical stress but as we know it's one of the few if not the only thing that's related to every single chronic disease that we can see so if we understand stress from today's aspect most people are living in fight or flight how bad and or dangerous is it really for us to live in fight or flight yeah it's detrimental to our health and vitality and Longevity ultimately because we are you know just to take it down to very rudimentary terms our nervous system is either in fight ORF flight which is meant to make us superum to either hunt for our food or you know fight Flee for our lives so it's this you know stress response that makes us very strong focused energized but it's only meant to be turned on for that survival period of either either escaping a predator uh or an enemy or you know going after our food so it's a survival thing you know back in the day it's turned on for a short period of time so we can you know survive and then it's meant to be turned off and the other side of that is the parasympathetic nervous system response and that's when we're resting we're basically healing resting rejuvenating and and restoring all of our body systems so if we are in fight or flight chronically which is what is happening in the state of the world with the inundation of a 24-hour news cycle we have not evolved quickly enough to keep up with this inundation with in information most of it negative and fear inducing fear inciting stressful um and violent and just dark we haven't evolved to to be able to process that amount of information so that's putting us in these like kind of chronic stress response Cycles which just in a very logical sense we cannot rest and repair and do all these things that our body needs to do to process the toxins in our environment to rest in repair and to do all the things that was designed to do and that's what's hindering that's what's you know one of the main issues of why we have this chronic illness epidemic yes there's toxins yes there's all sorts of you know bad food and processed food and all these things that are contributing to that but at the very minimum if we're not able to rest and repair we're just we're going down with the ship and so that's that stresses everything I mean it's really the basis of why we're all conically ill today it's interesting as you mention that because I've had the privilege of owning 10 multi-disciplinary health clinics and hiring and recruiting and managing a lot of different you know chiropractors naturopaths medical doctors and dentists over the years and if we were to really survey all of our patients and ask what is the core problem what is it that links every one together in terms of pathology and disease it would defin Ely be stressed yet it seems that many people are Their Own Worst Enemy we tend to be on the treadmill of life and in the rat race and not stop until we either one get that this is actually very detrimental or two we have a scare a health scare or something so just urging those out there to kind of tune in to where your nervous system might be at right now are you in fight or flight I mean speaking from experience I've had adrenal fatigue and burnout three times as an entrepreneur trying to you know get to that next stage or whatever and it is remarkably painful and it's better to take charge on your health and wellbeing now and I know Kelly you've been a vivid meditator and and and and and uh practicer of these tools for many years so just for everyone watching and listening what is your relationship to stress how are you mastering your life your emotions and your stress levels by taking time out nurturing yourself eating clean meditating um journaling praying whatever it is that you're doing so I'd love to give you little tips and tools and accountability measures throughout the podcast so you can just right away take control on your health Kelly you know what something that you've spoken about I really love your opinion on and we're going to get to the whole expansion of consciousness conversation soon I'm just itching and excited but before we do I want to talk about emotions okay this is so big in the movie heal and it's not the only work that you've done I love it and by the way we'll talk about Kelly's podcast soon you got to go check out this podcast and you obviously got to go watch the the movie as well but in the movie here there's there's a specific link and you talk about negative emotions and unres olved trauma I call them issues in the tissues from your experience can you tell me what what effect does negative emotions and unresolved trauma have on both one our health and two our quality of life please I mean it all ties back to stress so if we have a lot of us are not given the tools to process trauma and deep pain in the moment so what we do our body goes into shock and kind of we repress and suppress that intense emotion it's the feeling the energy of the feeling is too painful too terrifying you know whatever that trauma was that occurred we aren't we don't have the capacity to process it in the moment so that energy gets stored somewhere in the body and that disrupts flow that disrupts life force energy Chi whether it's the chakra system or traditional Chinese medicine all of these ancient wisdom it all goes back to the same thing it's a blockage of energy in the body body so it gets stored in your issues really do get stored in the tissues which then blocks energy when you don't have that energy flow and vitality you know things manifest into disease and physical the physical is always the last place that it will show up and express so I always go back and I love you know because I yes I'm very spiritual I'm very woooo but you've got to be based in science and I think that we're at a time in history where spirituality is kind of being demonstrated and proven through science so it's very exciting in the film there's a researcher named Dr Kelly Turner who her research is specifically tied to cancer which has a you know very like clear emotional route many of the times um and there's you know over 200 causes of cancer cancer is a very complex chronic disease but she researched all of like 1500 cases of spontaneous healing radical remission because when they were doing her she was doing her research she was like wait these like anomalies that they just keep tossing to the side of these people that healed were sent home to die and then all of a sudden they're not dead 20 years later from an you know they had Pancreatic Cancer all these incurable cancers she's like we should be studying them we shouldn't be discounting them as anomalies we should be studying what they did so she studied 1,500 cases and found out that all of these people who were sent home to dive of terminal incur you know air quotes incurable Cancer all did nine things this was at the point when the film came out now she added movement because she went back and looked at a research and they all did some sort of movement most of it was like walking but it was like walking or yoga so there's movement in there so the other nine things um two of them were physical which is radically changing your diet and using herbs and supplements and the other seven uh were mental emotional and and spiritual and that blew me away Kelly when I saw the movie I'm like I'm expecting the nutrition and a bit of movement and a bit of that and I'm like two out of nine is physical and I remember I wrote it down and I'm like what is going on and now we get to go deep so back to you this is exciting yeah and you're an energy guy so you get this like it's so much easier to shift the energy than to shift the matter and the matter is the diet and the the herbs and supplements um and the movement obviously shifts energy too but so one of them is is clearing and releasing negative emotions one of them is increasing positive emotions so emotions again is energy and motion it's feeling it's energy so so she just learned that they they all did some form of trauma healing and forgiveness and another expert in the film Joan Boris senko all of these experts have been doing this kind kind of holistic approach to healing and holistic is not woooo holistic is looking at the body as a whole system and not just like attacking you know one area and not realizing that it's connected to all the other systems of the body so like you give a pill for organ or system a it's going to throw there's going to be a downward consequence it's going to throw off the other system so it's like you have to look at the human body as a whole system in it everything's you know interconnected so anyways all of that to say Joan Bor senko said she was running since the like early 80s a a holistic Cancer Clinic and she said the ones who didn't heal 100% of the time were all holding on to regrets or resentments which is why forgiveness is such a massive part of healing because that's when you're holding on to that negative energy and emotion and you're just like in that victim Ood where you're blaming this person that wronged you and you're just a if that's in your body it's lowering your frequency and and disrupting your healing so all of that to say it's in the science it's in the research clinical data that people who don't heal are holding on to negative emotion and it's it's a necessary part of you I feel this is a microp moment I just want to take this opportunity to kind of let listeners and viewers kind of tune into that what are you holding on to what resentment judgment bitterness um regret guilt shame anger are you holding on to and the old expression I think it's pertinent here you know um being angry and Andor experiencing these emotions is like drinking poison and expecting someone else to be affected by it um there are methods there are tools there are amazing resources such as Kell's work and heel and and her podcast and some of the work that I do they can actually help you with this they can actually help you take a good look in the mirror and and realize that as I teach life never happened to you it always happened for you so I want to share a hypothesis with you Kelly because this is just mindboggling I U graduated 20 209 and retired 2016 I was burnt out I was unhappy um I was very corporately successful but I was sick and I was say mostly emotionally sick because I had not taken or given myself the opportunity to heal the unresolved troll in my body and in my mind from childhood my brother passed away my sister was disabled and that was difficult both my parents are alcoholics and so on and so forth and so I realized then that hang on you know so much of how we experience life is unconscious or subconscious and so I did what some people would do I just retired from clinical practice I had a lot of money I went to Peru I started drinking iasa and some other things it's been a very interesting Journey since my point being I remember once I was sitting in the jungle in Peru and I experienced this blue light this colar around my throat and when I tuned into my life I realized that there were some things in my life that I wasn't resonating with anymore there were people that I uh wasn't right for me to be in a relationship with there were things that I had been doing that wasn't right for me anymore and then as I started to study this to understand myself I came about an ancient blueprint from the Indian lineage and the bagita and the yoga Traditions um that showed that certain emotions block the different energy sent all the chakras and at the time I was a you know I had three degrees in science and I looked at it and I thought this is a bit woo woo isn't it but because I had some experience in yoga and and my intuition pulled me and I know you're big on intuition I started researching this and then I realized that fear and this is again the blueprint I didn't discover this I just kind of put the pieces together fear blocks the root Energy Center the first chakra guilt blocks the second shame blocks the third grief blocks the fourth lies block the fifth and so on and so forth so I thought to myself what if there's something in this so what I did is I wrote a curriculum it's called Quantum Advanced and it takes three days and we go through the clearing process and what we do is we help people identify their primary fear their greatest fear and then turn it into something productive from Fear to fuel and then we go through guilt and we can clear guilt we go through shame and we can clear shame um and and what happens over time is that there is this change of of how we hold our internal energy and I have to agree with what you said before because then our students and the people going through this they don't feel like drinking alcohol or eating crap food because they feel so great and often what we realize is that these vices these addictions come from not feeling good so I want to I want to ask you firstly have you uh what's your understanding let's go a little bit deeper into energy centers chakras and emotional imbalances as such and your uh I I guess experience in the effects on the body specifically what are your thoughts yeah I mean I I totally I've never heard the emotional blocks like You' you've put them so I'm like I need to go through your three-day program there's all sorts of healing in my chart which is not shocking right but I didn't know that before I did heal um all I know is that I seek truth I want to understand this like insatiable desire to understand the way things work so I've done every like healing you know mod ality and I continue to find things and then I experience them and I share them so that other people can you know find but you know I recently did a plant medicine journey and there was this and the the woman the shaman took me through this like mirror work and we connect I like went through and this wasn't what she was you know intending but the experience that I had is I I looked and saw in the mirror me between the ages of like 12 and 14 and I had like completely disconnected at that time from this part of me you know and I'm like look and I'm like thinking like was there something traumatic that happened that caused this disassociation or this disconnect but anyways the amount of healing that occurred by just witnessing and it was something I wasn't conscious of but there was just this like point in my life where I just kind of disconnected with a a part of myself and so in that time I reconnected to myself and like the amount of energy I have since that moment it was like there's just so many things that happen in our life that disconnect us you know and I'm not being very articulate but as you're talking about the chakras is like there's blocks there's fragments and for me it's just like all healing is wholeness it's it's coming back to your whole self and so part you know it's energy it's it's trauma it's you know and it's something that we do on our own but sometimes we need these facilitators and these you know exogenous you know experiences that can reflect back where we've just kind of disconnected from ourselves if that Mak makes sense and so yeah I think this is an important point because you know if you and I say this to my students sometimes imagine this you go uh online to your you know AI tool or just Google or whatever and you you look up what percentage of my atoms are made up of empty space and the answer scientifically proven since MOX plunk won the Nobel Prize for this over 100 years ago is 99 plus per empty space so we are made up of 99% pure untapped energy potential so the fact that we're playing at this very surface level of healing equals physical means that we're playing with less than 1% of our true healing potential just scientifically proven so I just want to point out what Kelly is speaking about here is not woo woo this is actual science it may feel woooo and it certainly did to me many years ago but this journey has been one of the greatest discoveries of my life and so I want to go a little bit deeper into this because now we're talking about understanding energy and Consciousness understanding who we really are and I think a useful tool that I've shared with my students is asking the question who am I in the first place and so then most people would say I am energy I am Consciousness I am matter I am spirit I am Source whatever and we know that scientifically true and so then it's not just that we are the body or the mind we are The Observers of the body and the mind and as such then we can change anything within that realm this puts the power back in our reality and and often you know students if they say that they go through healing let's say that we talk about regret like Kelly brought up before and we have regret because we heard someone or we lied to someone or someone deceived us or hurt us if we hold on to that we know that we're going to get sick all right we heard the results from do Turner's work earlier with the psychosomatic aspect of this but I think when people uh when we give ourselves permission to remember who we are as in I am Consciousness then life didn't happen to us it happened for us we are experiencing this reality we are not the sickness we are experiencing signs and symptoms of disease that doesn't mean we are sick there's a very big difference okay so I just wanted to put that out there because if you know who you are as in I am you know Consciousness well you have every tool in the entire toolbox to change your life how exciting okay Kelly let's talk Consciousness is interesting I mean we've been through Co we've been through a lot of crazy things uh and I think that the darker the dark the brighter the light what are your thoughts on the expansion uh and the evolution of human consciousness what's happening now on a collective level I believe we're like experiencing a breakdown before a breakthrough if that makes sense so it feels like it feels like there is an energy I don't you know there's the age of Aquarius that we're stepping into there's the frequency of the earth like all yeah it's like it's I I'm feeling all of it I'm witnessing all of it and systems are breaking down there's there's a lot of inflammation uh in society in the global Collective right so and and just and the way we're treating the planet like all of these systems and and our and our mentality and our kind of cons you know rabid consumption is it's not none of this is sustainable so to me I believe like you said the darker the dark the lighter the light I I and I believe in physics it's like there's an equal and opposite reaction in spirituality so as as much as there's and it's been throughout time and throughout history so you know with when there's this kind of negative Bend to what we're experiencing witnessing there's also just this equal and opposite it's just that's how the cosmos stay in Balance right I I don't know if I'm making any sense but to me it just feels like I'm watching a bad movie but with all that I've learned I can remove myself and as I'm looking I'm sitting in the mountains in Aspen Colorado and like there is so much Beauty still happening in the world and in N like nature just self-corrects we are part of nature so as I just encourage everybody to just kind of keep pulling back perspective keep opening the aperture it's so easy to get hooked especially with social media and everything else um into the negative but if we can just like breathe and pull back and it's you know it's a fine balance you want to be engaged you want to be an activist for things that are not just and things that are wrong in the world that you're passionate about however also it's like it's on us to be happy and present and grateful there's so much to be grateful for you know there's like so it's it's F you know it's on that individual level we're all healing like your podcast your work my work you there's just it's that equal and opposite for all the that's breaking down in the world and the systems and the corrupt politicians and you know pandemics and whatever like there's also so much Beauty and truly even though it seems super gnarly what's going on in the state of the world like we're doing we're like very blessed as a as a as a generation meaning technology like there's there's Wars there's suffering there's awful awful horrific things that happen every day but compared to like medieval times and to you know like we're and the Great Depression like we're doing okay you know so we're we just have to continue to you know be the change you wish to see in the world is probably one of the wisest things things that you could do it's like as we heal ourselves we are part of this Collective frequency right we are as we change our frequency we're sending out new information into the field collectively for all the people that are meditating for all the people that are doing the work that's expanding the energy in the field in the positive direction you know so I'm a you know I'm a hopeless Optimist but I'm I'm feeling good about this conversation and you know all of the people listening you know we're we're on the right side of History so I love that there's a lot of trust and faith in that and and I absolutely agree if you look back at the the past we are certainly living in very very blessed times and I think now speaking for myself it's a time to prepare and I'm not preparing from any aspect of fear or or worry or concern I'm preparing for an aspect of purifying my body because I do believe that we're entering higher states of consciousness and I do know that my vessel my body my temple must be able to hold and or assimilate these energies so I want to just quickly ask what are some of the top things that you're doing in your life right now to not just you know expand your own Consciousness and live a magical life I mean you're a mom you're a snowboarder you're you're an activist for amazing things to help the planet what are some of the things that you're focusing on now moving forward in your life yeah I love what you just said it's like we have to with this raise raising of the frequency you know I am held to more account to like this vessel you know because I'm so like I just came off of four days of a headache and and talking to other people it felt very like so like massive solar flares like my friend tracks the Schuman resonance meter and she was like this is going charts you know she like sending it to me I'm like what does this mean I don't know all I know is that I'm exhausted and I have a headache for no reason and why are they cutting out I mean you go back and you look at you follow the Schuman resonance you understand the what's happening with the waves of energy coming into the atmosphere but then it looks like they're cutting out parts of it there's certainly information bits of information missing so either they're missing it or they're hiding something it's interesting to see but we do know there's a lot of light entering the atmosphere I just wanted to put that in there back to you yeah so I mean so you're this is tracking with you because there was no reason why I should have a headache for four days that Advil and I don't I like it it pains me to take Advil like I'll take Advil on the third day of a headache and headaches debilitate me and with a 5-year-old it's like you can't you have to be able to function so I I think I took Advil like the end of the second day and it barely did anything and I'm just like this is like this is external this is not normal and and you know it was hormonal not to give too much information but it was like in line with my cycle but that's rare to have a headache and then there's this blue super moon full moon so all of that to say I think we as human beings these organisms were getting more sensitive and infiltrated with this raising of the frequency higher energy more light coming into the atmosphere whatever so we do have to be a little bit more diligent in our practices so that we can hold the space and I you know this may go a little too woooo or or real but I there's a lot of people not being able to sustain this frequency and they're choosing to leave the planet whether it's through overdose suicide it's like it is it's it's intensifying you know so even we're like we're pretty conscious and we're aware of what's going on and like I have to be I can't like I have to like drink less alcohol get more sleep you know I I just have to like do do better so that my my vessel can can handle it and it's it's it is and I'm just like you know the the uh rebellious teenager in me is like no I'm still young and I can handle this but it's like no I will like I can feel the shift so for me all of that to say my biggest thing is like of course I lean into my meditation practice but I just have to get closer to Nature like I think one of our biggest issues is disconnecting from disconnection from nature whether it's the cycles of sleep and light and dark and we're on this like unsustainable pace of life to keep up with the Joneses and be successful it's like no we need to go to sleep when the Sun goes down you know shortly therea we need to rise with the sun we need to eat seasonally in season and local all of that is making much more it has a lot more it's like we can't not do that anymore you know what I mean and getting my feet into the Earth um getting that early morning sun just being in the trees so that's my antidote right now is like getting into nature as much as possible H we are nature and so when we do wear rubber Souls all day we don't get sun on our skin we eat food like products rather than real food and we don't actually get to sit on the ground and and and you know breathe a meditate or Journal we are disconnected not only from our mother but from ourselves and I think this is extremely important to understand mother nature always corrects herself you mentioned that so beautifully Kelly and that means that we also have that innate intelligence to do just the same where are you not giving yourself mission to go out in nature and be still to to to you know swim in the oceans to to swim in the rivers to to do whatever this is extremely important I think really getting reconnected again with that 7.8 Herz frequency of the earth and when you're on the earth that that resonance will go through your beingness this is this is not anything new we know about this um so I'm I'm really excited about this and you've provided us with some really good insights to some very powerful tools um and of course guys you know go and check out the the movie heel and before we move on let me just do this right now this is this is for all you guys watching and listening pen and paper take a note firstly heal withth [ky.co](http://ky.co/) okay that's the website hewi [ky.co](http://ky.co/) o at Instagram it's heal with Kelly Allin one word that's Instagram heal with Kelly Allin one word and also Kelly gorz G RS so go and check out heel go and check out Kelly's work definitely jump on the podcast I would be delighted to jump on yours and have a deep dive whatever topic you want to go um but for now guys you're coming on you're for sure oh you're on okay it's on okay that I'm honored thank you um for now listeners and viewers use these resources to get inspired look at what in your life is not serving you anymore maybe put it to the side get out in nature and see what happens just give it 30 days and you'll notice a big change in yourself and and a perhaps even a reconnection to not only nature but also to Consciousness and spirit um Kelly I want to ask you um a couple of questions before we wrap up and I think this is one of the most important questions for me looking at my life what do you think now if we observe ourselves uh and we start to tune in you mentioned before when we change ourselves when we take care of ourselves on an individual level it's going to have an impact on the field all right so and I remember once I asked someone uh someone asked me excuse me you know what's going to happen in the world and my answer was if you asked that question you may not be a leader what do you think are some of the um decisions that we can make some of the standards maybe that we can apply in our lives to ensure that we're walking the right path uh into the into the future yeah I I think it's very important now especially with the rise of AI and the doctoring of images and just you know just capture of governments and big political machines and you know I'm not I'm not a conspiracy theorist I just like have learned a lot so you're realist think I get it yeah I'm a realist it's like yeah it's it's pretty lat at this day and age so I think you know one of the one of Kelly Turner's again this is her research from 10 years ago still applies today of those nine key Essentials to Healing now it's 10 with movement one of them is tapping into your intuition and I think the biggest thing right now is having practices so that you can tune in you the unique listener that there's never been anyone like you ever in the history and never in this moment in time right now you are a unique beautiful person that is here to share their gifts um and you have an internal guidance system that is directly from Source your higher self your soul whatever you want to call it constantly giving you guidance and Truth through the interpretation of this incredible mechanism called the human body that's why I think you said the cutest term I've ever heard with this truth bumps I've never heard that before we call them Goosebumps on this side of the hemisphere but like truth bumps so true it's like that is your body giving you guidance as a channel from the energy of your higher self so first and foremost the biggest thing that everybody can do right now is have tools and practices that connect you or or help you to hear understand and translate the voice of your intuition and the guidance so how do we do that I mean I think prayer meditation getting into this getting into the frequency of Nature and just sitting there in silence and being once you're observed by Nature you can you become a Clear Channel to source so your intuition becomes very loud in that silence and frequency of of the Perfection of nature nature meditation constantly I call it mental hygiene um which you know Marian Williamson speaks so beautifully about in the film you know we shower it's totally societally normal to shower our physical bodies off every day um it should be just as if not more important to shower our minds and the gunk and the residue and all the buildup we get from the stress of the day and the information we're taking on we need mental hydrant we need to to cleanse and release all of that you know buildup and and energetic plaque of our thoughts and all the stuff that we that just kind of clutters our mind every day in meditation I you know I love Transcendental Meditation because you use 20 minutes in the morning to set the tone and create the space so that you can deal with the day and then 20 minutes in the afternoon slash evening to let go and shower off all the gunk that you've accumulated in the day so so I just think you know those pract journaling in the morning gratitude gratitude is a frequency that um again just changes the flow and vitality like the the language of the universe is like love and that the language of nature is like gratitude and awe nature is just in awe of itself all the time it's an awe and just so grateful for its source for providing everything it needs to regenerate and and survive and and be and Thrive and just be beautiful so if we can tap into that frequency of awe and gratitude you know Journal meditate mental hygiene and then be in nature to tap into that higher um guidance that inner guidance from our source and our higher self I think that's what we need to uh be able to navigate the Rapids of the current times I remember that from watching heel the intuition part actually came in super strong and that's been something that I've observed not only in myself within my CL but also within my closer Circle those who are giving themselves time to be still to meditate to actually listen and I mean with with our senses multi- uh you know dimensional sensors more so than just the five or six if you include thought they are the ones that are able to find answers much faster so I love this conversation about intuition it's as if it's a a superpower innately given to us that many have forgotten or suppressed what would happen if we would activate the true part of the intelligence of that within ourselves and isn't it amazing that we all have the capacity to do so without paying a scent for it meditation is free hiking is free journaling is free and so on and so forth I love it Kelly okay sister I've got one last question for you straight off the cuff are you ready yep let's go so here's the question I want you to now man imagine um Kelly nunz you're on this world stage the entire world every sentient being alive has gathered they're watching they're listening and they're tuning in to your message when you're ready take a breath take as long as you need and do share Kelly what is your message to the world right now this is good so my message to the world would be we live in a world of infinite possibility we all have unique incredible purpose for being here at this time in history we have unique superpowers and gifts to express we have unique and perfect Beauty in whatever form that we have shown up here in this lifetime at this time and so much more is possible than we've been led to believe once we tap into the intelligence the Beauty and the love that nature shows us and once we can connect to Source like we have access to infinite possibility like whatever you dream know that that dream is in you and in your Consciousness because in some possibility it is it's already happened so not only you were given that dream because you've were also given everything you need to see that dream realize then go beyond that stretch your mind beyond that go okay that's my dream in this current Consciousness go beyond what's even bigger than that dream like stretch possibility because so much more is possible than we can imagine and you know life is good and like you said in closing life is for us never against us things are not happening to us they're happening for us so let's go sorry yes yes you can yes you can oh brilliant brilliant
