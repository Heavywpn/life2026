## A Brief History of YouTube

YouTube was founded in February 2005 by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim, former PayPal employees.

The first video, "Me at the zoo," was uploaded on April 23, 2005, featuring co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo.

In November 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion, marking a significant milestone in the platform's growth.

YouTube introduced its partner program in 2007, allowing content creators to earn revenue from their videos.

The platform has since evolved to include features like live streaming, YouTube TV, and YouTube Premium, becoming one of the most visited websites globally.

As of 2024, YouTube continues to be a dominant force in online video sharing and streaming, with billions of users worldwide.

most people don't realize the way that Amazon says to you or by the way do you want that diaper that follows you around  
0:11  
all those websites it's because your data is being sold behind the scenes through Brokers the average person now apparently has an attention span of 8  
0:17  
seconds and the last big attacks in terms of where people's data was stolen was because of human error data literacy  
0:22  
is the worst it's ever been now let's talk about data but not in the way that you think these social media companies  
0:29  
gather our dat data so that they can generate revenue from advertisers that want to advertise to people with  
0:35  
specific parts of data in mind your data that you create is often duplicated so for example if you own three devices I  
0:43  
own an Apple Watch Android phone all of these things I'm repeating the same data I can never connect it I can never pull  
0:48  
it apart because it's living in different companies it's my data but it's separated now be prepared to have  
0:54  
your mind blown I met Michael a week and a half ago spent an hour and a half with him and my head literally blew off so I  
1:02  
know for sure it's going to have some impact on [Music]  
1:11  
you hi everyone and welcome to this episode of the podcast now let's talk  
1:16  
about data but not in the way that you think look these social media companies  
1:22  
gather our data so that they can generate revenue from advertisers that want to advertise to people with  
1:29  
specific parts of data in mind and that is really really profitable for these  
1:37  
companies but why should they own our data why should they be in charge of our data why shouldn't we be in charge of  
1:44  
our own data why shouldn't we make money from our own data and how can our own data help us live a healthier and  
1:52  
happier life that is the question that Michael Clark is going to answer today  
1:58  
now be prepared to to have your mind blown I met Michael a week and a half  
2:03  
ago spent an hour and a half with him and my head literally blew off so I know for sure it's going to have some impact  
2:10  
on you so let's cue the music and ask ourselves the question why don't we own our own data and what can we do to get  
2:17  
it back and potentially benefit from it  
2:26  
[Music]  
2:35  
all right folks let me tell you about iopn the internet of people iopn is the  
2:40  
next iteration of the internet using revolutionary blockchain technology that's built on decentralized community  
2:47  
ownership now when I say decentralized community ownership I mean it's not only controlled by a bunch of tech Giants  
2:53  
instead everyone who's part of it has a say and a stake in how things run it gives regular people like me and you and  
3:00  
businesses and Brands an easy and fair chance to grow and make some money and build communities iopn is making things  
3:07  
happen through a few key verticals now let's go through them OPN chain is a  
3:12  
Cutting Edge layer one blockchain that's efficient scalable and eco-friendly IE  
3:18  
cognitive a set of AI tools changing how we develop apps yeah develop apps OPN  
3:24  
verse a dynamic hyper realistic AI powered platform that's making web 3  
3:30  
experiences better big organizations like Dubai multicommodity Center Dubai World Trade Center and Ras Al government  
3:38  
are already seeing the potential with IOP in themselves it's about creating a web3 future where technology serves us  
3:46  
you know us the people unlike what web 2 did where we often end up serving big  
3:51  
tech companies check out the internet of people today and see how you can leverage their ecosystem I promise you  
3:57  
it's worth the Time Michael thank you so much for coming to join us on the show today that's a pleasure to be here some  
4:03  
of what you said to me when I first met you scared the hell out of me um some of it excited me and that's why I was  
4:09  
really Keen to get you on the show and share with our audience today this  
4:15  
fascinating world of data and to be honest with you most people are naive  
4:20  
ignorant or or I just choose maybe not to want to know what's going on in the  
4:27  
world these these flash terms that keep being brought up now nowadays AI you know what does it mean and how can it  
4:32  
Implement be implemented in your business you know Then followed with the chat GPT is the the the then the thing  
4:38  
that's said and people don't really understand what's going on with that but one thing that I think that's really  
4:43  
fascinating for me is that I as a content creator for many years have always been highly aware that these  
4:50  
institutions these massive organizations the social media companies meta and Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok and  
4:57  
Google and whatnot collect my data M and they collect it for their benefit Y and  
5:04  
so that's the bit that I want to start out with you today okay I want to understand what you mean when you say  
5:11  
they've got the data and it shouldn't be yours it should be yours yeah it's a really good point so when you when you  
5:18  
think about what I think take a step back and ask yourself what data is that's the best place to start in a very  
5:23  
non-technical way um I look at data as really our stories and our memories and  
5:28  
our experiences so if you think about the photographs that you take the things that you want to keep they belong to you  
5:35  
in a way but today they don't um you give them to others to look after um  
5:40  
there's no insurance around what you hand over um so it could get lost at any moment um so if you start in that point  
5:46  
and say okay if these are my stories and my memories how valuable are they to you because that's really where you should  
5:52  
start and then you look at data in a very different way because today I think we've been brought up as you rightly say  
5:57  
it's key to chat gbt um it's going to give you everything you want but if you break it down you know that's where you  
6:03  
should start and say well actually data is personal to me and that's what it means and why shouldn't I own it um  
6:08  
that's really the starting point in all of this so when we think about that then let's take some some some common example you say photographs so everything that  
6:15  
that I produce as data so that can be stuff that I produce consciously but you  
6:21  
know there'll be people that say I never use social media I don't produce data but for those people that think like that what type of data are they  
6:27  
producing inadvertently that we can constitute in this conversation so think about how you got to the office this  
6:34  
morning so Google Maps is a great example or any map software nopic on Google that journey to work generated  
6:40  
data um unknown to you on your way to work you were commoditized because as you drive along  
6:46  
people are now suddenly firing advertisements that you just say hey do you want to go to this place do you want to go to that place so even something as  
6:52  
simple as driving to work is now making somebody else money but you never get access to that data yourself which you  
6:59  
could have used for yourself um after the journey which is then you start thinking about it that way things start  
7:05  
to get a bit more interesting because you start to ask yourself the question well what could I have done with that data if it was mine and why is it only  
7:12  
being done this way okay that that's one of the big questions that we need to  
7:17  
answer today give me some more examples that no not what you could do with it  
7:22  
some examp like You' just given because I want to make sure that everyone's Can Be Touched by this so as soon as you just said that to me about Google Maps  
7:29  
I'm like like I can go in and look at my map history and I can go and see all these different Journeys that I've taken  
7:35  
even even if I've not put them into Google Maps corre so that that triggered me what give me another example of that  
7:41  
so um even simple things like your Apple watch and things like that also think  
7:47  
about it this way your data that you create is is often duplicated so for example if you own  
7:53  
three devices I own an Apple Watch I own an Android phone all of these things I'm  
7:58  
repeating the same data I can never connect it I can never pull it apart because it's living in different  
8:04  
companies it's my data but it's separated so how many versions of you exist on a daily basis most people have  
8:10  
about 100 passwords and don't realize it so your data is never connected which means you can never add to it which  
8:16  
means you you're always repeating yourself almost so data is being sold constantly without you knowing behind  
8:22  
the scenes but not only that you can't use it to solve your own problems let me explain to you what that means in very  
8:27  
simple terms let's think about your health as a great example because we talked about this when we when we first met today not one person alive has a  
8:34  
single view of their health um which means that we have all of these apps I have a whoop um a few people have an  
8:40  
Apple Watch and so on but they're never connected they're never connected so it means we never get a really true picture  
8:45  
of how our health is can we prevent things all of these things that we could if we owned our data and I think that's  
8:51  
why ownership is really important because it's not about how much money I make from my data it's actually what it  
8:57  
could mean for my life um how it could save my life um if I could connect that data myself wow okay so how do other  
9:05  
companies use my data to make money this is like the hidden secret of the  
9:11  
internet I think um and this kind of all started around 2003 um believe it or not  
9:16  
in the marketing world Google bought AdSense and the internet before that was more of a library almost people  
9:23  
connected communities so from like 2003 where we are today a lot of then the data that we produce got sold um most  
9:30  
people don't realize the way that Amazon says to you well by the way do you want that diaper that follows you around all  
9:36  
those websites is because your data is being sold behind the scenes through Brokers and various other companies who  
9:42  
are selling data every second to people who want that and a connecting bits of you to basically create that picture and  
9:49  
create Revenue which is either for advertising and marketing for that company or data that other people would  
9:55  
gladly purchase so they can understand your behavior to try and sell you another product right so let's let's take that as an  
10:01  
example I'm a father let's say and I've got young children and I buy diapers okay the the the people that sell the  
10:07  
diapers want to advertise to me because I buy the diapers and they can only do that by buying uh by advertising using  
10:13  
the data that's sold to them essentially by Facebook and and other companies like that yeah yeah and also use the example in America there's well-known story that  
10:20  
a child a girl got pregnant and didn't want to tell her parents but Amazon knew before her parents yes they collected  
10:26  
all of the data about her and then they told the DAT Amazon told told her and then her parents found out from Amazon  
10:31  
not their daughter because of how much data look as as time progresses we have  
10:36  
you and I know we're going to talk about this is we'll have more data about us which will then build an even bigger picture about us and the question then  
10:43  
is how much more control do we want about that because how personal it starts to become okay well this this for  
10:49  
many people could be scary okay could be frightening first of all frightening the other people are using my data and I  
10:55  
just take some simple examples that I'm sure that one or two viewers and listeners might be aware of an  
11:00  
inappropriate photo yeah 100% you know an inappropriate photo of something intimate between you and your your wife  
11:06  
or your husband that that piece of data you wouldn't want anybody else to see want but but actually there's lots of  
11:13  
organizations that have access to it 100% um that goes on on a daily basis um  
11:18  
I use a term which is a bit controversial the way data storage is today is like unregulated banking um just give me let me sh me out  
11:26  
and give you that comparison so today if I put 200 Durham or $20000 into a bank  
11:31  
the bank insures me for that um they're also told what they can do with it usually is about 10 times the monetary  
11:37  
value they can lend out and there's obviously other regulations and things and I can get it when I want subject to proving my identity and other factors if  
11:45  
you think about your photographs today you will upload those but you're not insured if they're  
11:50  
lost um and there are some privacy controls in terms of what these companies are allowed to do but they  
11:56  
still can do other things if you commit and give your consent so the data related to those photographs can be used  
12:01  
for monetization um and then afterwards then as long as you can prove who you are but sometimes they will lock you out anyway because you didn't give enough  
12:08  
proof maybe you changed location that's happened to me personally so I always make the question what would be more important to you if your bank lost $200  
12:16  
or a cloud provider lost 20 years of your photographs what would be more important  
12:21  
to you now that's why I now think data is important to Everyday Life as water  
12:27  
and I think data is more important than money because of that simple fact if you lost 20 years of your entire family  
12:33  
because of mistake of a cloud provider with no insurance that would mean more to you personally I think than to any  
12:39  
amount of money on this Earth good point okay so we know that these external  
12:45  
organizations are monetizing the data that that they're gathering on us you you your essentially your belief is that  
12:53  
you want to stop that and allow us to have the ownership of our own data so yes and no so um one is about  
13:01  
Fair rewards so basically but I also want us to stop thinking about monetizing  
13:07  
data because if we think of monetization of data as the answer to everything then that's we're losing sight of the power  
13:13  
of data I think when you and I first met I use the term I think data is potential um because that's the other way I look  
13:19  
at data it's the potential to innovate it's the potential to save lives and yes we'll make money from data but if that's  
13:24  
our only lens on this then we're all missing out because I would even AR that even the ones today that make the money  
13:31  
off our data have all missed out because they don't have a single view of our life they only have a version of our  
13:36  
life so they can Amazon can only see my Amazon life they have no idea what I watch on Netflix for example so they're  
13:43  
only building a version of me that they know so my argument is that if Apple  
13:48  
could see all of my data and I allowed them to have it because I owned it it could be worth even more than they are  
13:53  
today because they can give me utilities um to manage my health for example which connect all that data which we don't  
13:59  
have today but also I could create my own utilities that help me manage my health or other things and yes of course  
14:05  
I'll monetize my data which is a big part of the AI story today um where we know that a lot of people's data has  
14:11  
being used to build AI without their knowledge but my argument is well we need Ai and AI needs us and a big part  
14:18  
of that is also a fair reward for how our data has been used to create Ai and constantly how it's used so it's a  
14:23  
mixture of the people who take our data today also getting benefit but more me  
14:29  
as a consumer I also get a benefit because now what I'm using is a reflection of how unique I am and who I  
14:36  
am rather than a generic view of myself if if you if if we take  
14:41  
monetization and just park it for one minute and and and look at how those other companies use the data they're using the data so that it can be  
14:48  
effective in certain ways the thing the thing that kind of resonates I'm curious about now is Health okay because that's  
14:54  
the one thing that's the most important thing to all of us although some of us seem to be on a a mission of death a lot of the time um that bit that you said  
15:02  
resonates me you you wear a whoop you know I wear a Garin and and and you've got your Apple watch and these two  
15:08  
devices aren't talking to each other and that's just these two that are on your wrist let alone um all of the other  
15:14  
information that's gathered about your health in different ways how can how can what you're proposing how can that help  
15:22  
me so let me probably give a really I'm always open and honest with my my  
15:28  
audience so recently um I was told you know you're at the age Spencer but you need to have a thumb put up your bum so  
15:34  
that you can check your colon all right and I was like I probably been hearing that for five or  
15:39  
six years and then someone who's a bit older than me a friend of mine he said to me said you need to get it done okay  
15:45  
A friend of mine got sick he had some cancer blah blah blah you know you need to go and get it checked and so I was um  
15:51  
I was reticent to go as I think most men are but I but I eventually conceded and went to the hospital here and um had a  
15:57  
camera put where it shouldn't go and uh uh the work that was done to find out that I was all  
16:04  
good that information there has impact on other information on  
16:11  
other parts of my body and other parts of Health okay cancer is something that spreads into other parts of our body as  
16:17  
an example when we when we own our own data are you suggesting that we're able  
16:24  
essentially to combine all of this different information from the hospital that I went to here the American  
16:29  
Hospital so the one five year or 10 years ago I had my spinal surgery in London um to to the one where I had my  
16:35  
my my clavicle done and the metal plate put in there when I fell off my bike at the medic Medicare place here um is it  
16:42  
just Gathering all of that together and putting it in a place where there's that can be then read and understood and  
16:48  
further diagnosis can be done to optimize my health correct and this is where the AI story comes in okay so  
16:55  
today we've been told a narrative that AI is better than us right a lot of the narrative because it's created a divide  
17:01  
in society right we have to admit that there's parts of the world that think it's going to solve everything we've ever had a problem with there's the  
17:07  
other half of the world that are rightly concerned and think we're going to lose our jobs the reality is I think we're moving into an era of collaborative  
17:14  
collaborative AI where humans and AI will work together but on people's own data so let's take your example um I  
17:21  
work out quite a lot so when I first met my PT she knows nothing about me she only knows what I tell her yeah and then  
17:28  
we figure that out through the sessions um it's lucky that she specializes in biomechanics so she can actually figure  
17:33  
out as she goes along but wouldn't it be useful if you took all of that data that you've just collected and then you could  
17:40  
show her where your injuries are what you have and then all a sudden then you get an excise program that's taken for  
17:45  
you even your AI could probably say to you on all your data um hey Spencer um I  
17:51  
can see all these injuries I can see bits about your nutrition maybe you want to think about XYZ because the reality  
17:57  
is AI is not going to queue at cancer but with your own data might be able to prevent it because through predictions  
18:03  
and patterns and past examples in your life I can bring all that data together and suddenly I have a different picture  
18:09  
of you and this is the really important bit the way the AI is being developed today is trying to treat everybody the same with the way it reports and gives  
18:17  
you Insight the reality is we're all unique the story you've just said is unique to you yeah so in a way only you  
18:23  
can really self diagnose if because basically you'd have to go and see all of those doctors individually m someone  
18:29  
who's amazing to piece that story together um but if you had all your data and AI was there all of a sudden now  
18:35  
that story changes because what it's giving you advice on is what makes you unique which is those life events and  
18:41  
that data effectively and we've established clearly now in the world not  
18:47  
everybody's the same we know that people are different and so the same exercise program nutrition program or whatever it may be is not going to work on everyone  
18:54  
how does how does that that how does that then get translated  
18:59  
because if it's Gathering that information and it's suggesting it how is it suggesting it and and you know is  
19:05  
it is it then providing that information to a holistic doctor that then says right I've understood everything now  
19:11  
based upon all this information that's been gathered over the last 54 years of your life spener this is the direction  
19:16  
you need to head in or is that going to be something that that that that that allows us to understand it so that we  
19:21  
can then plan with it so this this opens up another question or at least an area of focus so a lot of the work that I've  
19:28  
been doing doing in this space and it dawned on me that we also don't yet have the skills needed to interpret what AI  
19:35  
is going to give us and and some of that's not our fault that's just our dependency on technology over time so we  
19:42  
have to reason with ourselves and understand that we become visual thinkers um the average person now  
19:47  
apparently has an attention span of 8 seconds um the last big attacks in terms of where people's data was stolen was  
19:54  
because of human error um and data literacy is the worst it's ever been so the the real value of ownership of data  
20:00  
and I would argue treating data like an asset would mean children are now educated on how to read it how to think  
20:06  
critically how to debate how to reason so that's the other reason that ownership of data is really important  
20:12  
because then we will teach people how to read it um so look you're not I'm not saying you're going to replace your  
20:17  
doctor but at least some of these things may give you advice which are not life-threatening and there will be a  
20:23  
moment where we say well actually you probably should see a doctor because of what I can see but also your past history but you know what the thing the  
20:30  
thing that sticks out for me more than anything else is is the whole preventing correct you know for me it's like if if  
20:36  
people knew that they this data could help them prevent yeah getting cancer which  
20:43  
impacts one in two people one or two women anyway um on this planet that that  
20:49  
that literally will save more lives than a  
20:55  
war on or apocalypse would ever take let me give you a real good example I met this lady on a plane I'm I'm sure she  
21:00  
will remind me telling this story um I got in a plane and there was a lady opposite me very sitting in a very  
21:06  
uncomfortable position um I she had pillows and towels and things and I asked her we got talking and I said why  
21:12  
are you sat like that she said back cancer I said how did you find that out and she broke her back in the gym  
21:17  
training um which was unusual because she was so young so the doctor analyzed unfortunately you've got back cancer and  
21:23  
you're stage four right months and months and months later shakula  
21:29  
doctors don't know how a mixture of what she thought she should do with medical  
21:34  
advice but whatever it did it worked she's a life coach so I asked her I said  
21:39  
well what did you do she said well I can't remember really but because I'm a life coach now people now want me to  
21:44  
help them in a similar position and I said to her well if you owned your data  
21:49  
you could have collected everything that you did and then wouldn't it be amazing if you could share that value with  
21:55  
someone else you take your data set and you give it to someone who's got the same as you and their AI combines their  
22:01  
data with your data and suddenly they find the answer that's unique to that individual based on your learnings and  
22:08  
who's to say you then give that to a pharmaceutical company who then instead of generating a pill they generate  
22:15  
everybody an algorithm so that everybody then can follow that and manage their own health in a similar condition that's  
22:20  
what we're talking about we have enough data in the world and enough technology now to get us to a place where if we  
22:27  
treat data like an asset we could prevent much more than just the health  
22:33  
side wow but wow with a which begs the  
22:39  
question why has this not already happened it makes me makes me feel sad  
22:45  
that something as as as remarkable and impactful as that that there there are  
22:51  
so many more things in the world that we're spending time money and effort on right now but that seems to me as like  
22:57  
the biggest game changer the planet could ever face it's a it's a history that's often been Untold um we've I've  
23:04  
sold it wow that's massive though isn't it it is I as I just start and process  
23:10  
that I mean it's like that if you could actually do that so if you take that to  
23:16  
its full end degree with the technology we're having now when you're born I could give you a digital twin of view  
23:23  
and I could AB test you based on your own data and what your parents inherited to you as a piece of data so if you were  
23:29  
born with diabetes for example and your parents had diabetes or one of them throughout their life and they pass on  
23:35  
that data belongs to them so they would give it to you as an inheritance and then you could run that on the AI which  
23:42  
could be 20 years later digital twin technology exist where you can take a replica of a machine today I could take  
23:47  
a replica R you and then use the same data to see what medication would work before I even give it to you that's a  
23:53  
10year vision that is completely possible um but again you've got to start with not the technology and this  
23:59  
goes back to your question why don't we have it now is because our focus is in the wrong place we see the technology as  
24:05  
the answer but the real power has been there all along which is the data the identity and the value it  
24:11  
generates so the more we SP Focus Less on technology and more on data what I'm  
24:17  
describing is just literally scratching the surface health is just one example you you go on and on in terms of what we  
24:23  
can see because the other problem is Spencer we've been brought up to believe that data means  
24:28  
monetization but actually data is a utility and a store value at exactly the same time what does that mean well one I  
24:35  
can use it to make money for myself if an AI uses my algorithm I'll get paid many times over which is great but the  
24:40  
other amazing thing for me is I can use the create utilities I've just described um imagine you've got an AI  
24:47  
with your data and suddenly it says to you Spencer you can see you've got a health app but you're missing some data  
24:53  
that would help you why don't you go to a hike in some far off country you rest  
24:59  
but you'll collect dat that's really valuable to others and you and you could sell that on an exchange and make some  
25:05  
money for yourself but at the same time it would build a bigger picture of your health but improve your cardiovascular  
25:10  
system it's like sold why wouldn't you yeah absolutely yeah gee man it's just  
25:18  
like it's so exciting it's like it's like okay a lot of time a lot of time  
25:25  
it's always about how can it be implemented okay you know what what are the practical steps of being implemented  
25:31  
so I know that you've put some thought into this that's why you're sat here today but um tell me what when you had  
25:37  
these realizations and the were these moments for you big moments like they are for as I'm listening to it now they  
25:42  
they were yeah so so the story with this goes back four years I was asked to write a paper a very long time ago on  
25:48  
what the future of data would be in 2030 and I I kind of had those he in the moment you know here standing up moments  
25:54  
in a room where it's was like it dawned on me this was much more important that I'd be asked to do um but it also dawned  
26:01  
on me we need to do more um and we need to know more about this and that's kind  
26:07  
of what started the journey I think we all have these moments where we find something or we start something and it gets bigger than ourselves this is what  
26:14  
it became so yeah they then what I'm doing and what I've been have done is doing exactly what you just asked which  
26:21  
is the steps to get there either for a government to put this in place so some of these longer term or even near term  
26:26  
Things become a reality but also what are the fundamental things that we need in this but also not  
26:32  
forgetting the role that people play in all of this which I think is close to your heart everyone we met as well talking about people and organizations  
26:38  
and their roles and I'm sure we'll come on to that is their importance in it so yeah the the the steps are really  
26:44  
important I can go through some of those if absolutely we need to go I want to be I want make sure everybody not only sits  
26:51  
there and has just done what I've done as you've explained what you explained but you know what are these what are these moves that we need to make so if  
26:57  
you think about so what makes ownership possible obviously starts with the regulator and the government um I'm  
27:03  
fortunate to be living in Dubai and I can have those conversations and it's exciting and it probably won't surprise  
27:09  
you how open they are to those conversations the first step in anything is recognizing people's legal right to own their data that's that's the first  
27:15  
big tick um we mustn't underestimate the role of your identity with that because you are your data and that's how you  
27:21  
prove yourself so those two are critically important I think then there's the awareness like this podcast  
27:27  
is giv people that awareness but I think then regulators and other organizations then will have to make people aware of  
27:32  
what that means in the near term people can help themselves um they can actually  
27:38  
think more clearly about what they do with their data in the short term maybe work with companies where they can  
27:43  
access their data and use it themselves um and just become more Curious over  
27:48  
time some of the work I'm doing is helping build the curriculums for schools in terms of how children now can  
27:54  
become critical thinkers again and learn to reason so then they will be in a position to actually use their data with  
28:00  
an AI in the right way um but the biggest thing you know that's what you can do as individual and that's what  
28:05  
needs to be done at a government level there's a raft of technology behind all of this I'm very fortunate to be working with people on those um but yeah that's  
28:12  
your starting point one is educate yourself and build an awareness of these things and also ask yourself the  
28:18  
question why and what could I do and the second part of the equation is unfortunately we can't do anything until  
28:23  
the government gives us a helping hand and that's part of the work that I'm doing when you talk to governments about a subject matter like this do they  
28:30  
immediately jump on it and say we get it we understand it we want to try and do something about it or do you get um for  
28:36  
obvious reasons I would suspect push back a little bit of push back but that's only because I think the way that  
28:42  
we've been taught what data is so we've touched on that we've been taught data is monetization we've also been taught  
28:49  
that data is fear which is where data privacy comes from yeah so people have been I guess  
28:56  
told it's scary to share your look after it don't use it so then we constantly  
29:01  
have privacy rules when actually that's probably not the answer the answer is now ownership in Choice which is the  
29:07  
conversation I have with the regulator to say look let's be realistic we're going to have an AI fairly soon that no  
29:13  
one's ever going to be able to keep up with they the regulator so do we actually then say maybe there's a  
29:18  
different model which is we give people the ownership and choice we give them the technology to do that and maybe the  
29:24  
regulator then shifts their attention to what really matters which is security and ethics and then the game changes but  
29:30  
then more importantly you talk to the regulator around look this isn't about monetization this is about giving people the things they've never had I would  
29:36  
even argue what even businesses have never had and if you bring this into fruition you will open up innovation in  
29:43  
a national level National level because you will now invite fex companies who  
29:49  
will help people and businesses use data in the way that I'm describing so you create an ecosystem and an economy  
29:55  
around this that's why it's exciting for the regulator because now you create a culture of innovation but also you  
30:00  
create a new Workforce you build the Next Generation and you almost build you  
30:06  
know the underpinnings of of a new way  
30:11  
forward how cool is that talk to me about how you link the  
30:16  
blockchain with the ambition here because I think that and again let's just make sure that there'll be there'll  
30:22  
be people here that don't understand really what the blockchain has said I don't want to jump too too deep into that but I want people to to understand  
30:29  
the connection because we just had uh in the Press yesterday uh an announcement that M2 is going to allow people to um  
30:37  
uh trade trade their uh ethereum and Bitcoin in their local currency in their bank accounts here the government of Abu  
30:43  
Dhabi have just to authorize that which I think will you know less and more and  
30:49  
more take people to less and less fear around the whole world of crypto because it's becoming normalized and we heard  
30:55  
what Trump's saying if he gets back into Power what he's going to do as well so that's I I hope bringing more people  
31:01  
into this place of not thinking that you know crypto is some crazy nutty scam and  
31:06  
and the blockchain and web3 is uh is Bonkers so just in really simple terms  
31:11  
how are you doing what you're doing there so you've used the magic words so bit Bonkers no that is also a magic word  
31:18  
because you haveed Bonkers to put the pieces together um so Bitcoin and ethereum I look at data as the brother  
31:25  
and sister of both of them because Bitcoin is a story value MH ethereum is programmable data is  
31:31  
both so what if you made data a token itself and what if you could store  
31:38  
it on a ledger in terms of every time it's used who has it because that's really what the blockchain is right it's  
31:43  
a mutable record of something that was stored in a ledger like in the olden days where we'd have a be some you know  
31:49  
Ledger ins and outs big books big books right the lines in exactly now now now it's digital um and the currency is is  
31:56  
is data uh my argument is the currency now is intelligence because actually what we're sharing is knowledge and I  
32:03  
can tokenize it and I can store in a blockchain okay so let's let's just Dum that down a little bit okay tokenize it  
32:09  
so we can create a a Bitcoin 2.0 or we can we can whatever we want to call it  
32:14  
okay let's let's call it let's call it whatever we want but it essentially becomes its very own token that sits  
32:22  
alongside all of the other tokens as as an asset that you can buy and trade and  
32:28  
that that data itself then each each piece of data is owned by whoever the owner is correct and his access for a  
32:35  
wallet that you hold the word asset though is what you said is really important um because a lot of the work  
32:42  
I'm doing is making data into a real world asset so treating it like water so  
32:47  
if you think of the outage that happened a few weeks ago or a week ago now isn't it um where you know major system change  
32:54  
for the first time I guess locked us all out of our computers okay so the so for people that that aren't familiar with it  
32:59  
here in the world recently if you're under under a rock we had they said someone turned a switch or fress a  
33:06  
button somewhere in a cyber security company I foret Cloud strike I think it was and and basically many many people  
33:13  
shops couldn't use their terminals to take payments and you know all kinds of computer systems crashed what that  
33:19  
showed to me and I hope it showed to the world is that data is now as more important as life as long as water  
33:26  
because because we couldn't access data because we couldn't use it in our jobs all of a sudden the world stopped right  
33:31  
because really what the computer was was just a device to create and show a state so when we start saying well data is an  
33:38  
asset and you ask me blockchain and token the real value is when it becomes a real world asset because now everybody  
33:44  
touches that data becomes a critical service provider they become regulated in terms  
33:50  
of how they handle and manage data like the water company so I can't imagine the water company ever having a crisis like  
33:56  
that and nobody ever been able to drink water in in a development bills it's the same thing he would just put extra  
34:02  
layers of Regulation and the companies that store your data today would also be treated as a regulated entity so then  
34:08  
all of a sudden then you've got a technology that allows you to move data around securely and safely and makes it  
34:14  
traceable which is what we're talking about but also then the companies and the facilitator and look after for you  
34:19  
are also treated as critical service providers so everything then changes because then you look at data then as  
34:25  
not something that belongs in a system but it's it's actually critical to everything that we do you know for your  
34:30  
listeners have a think about when you had breakfast this morning to when you went to bed how many things did you touch gave you data the screen you  
34:37  
looked at the alarm clock in the morning that's digital all of those things are data really and they become so important  
34:43  
to everyday life that we've lost sight of it which is why the technology allows us to make this possible but at the same  
34:49  
time the regulation then allows us to change our mindset can I want to I want to get back  
34:56  
to getting to some some kind of like mic drop moments here so we can we can get people that might have got a little bit  
35:02  
confused by that excited again we talked about health yeah okay what a g give me some other give me some other fun  
35:07  
examples of where where our audience right now will S I didn't know it could do that that would be cool for me if it  
35:14  
could do this give me a couple of examples around that kind of stuff so let's go let s Finance okay um so  
35:20  
there's a few things one I actually really want to do I'm kind of giving it do I give this away give it away I don't G to do anything with it I think you  
35:26  
could build a data Bond what's a data Bond so in in financial terms you can you can invest in a bond yeah so this is  
35:32  
basically where a government or an organization wants to wants to borrow money so say they're building a property  
35:37  
um or even a group of properties they would issue a bond and they'll collect the money from people who will then get  
35:43  
make money out of that property development over time the interest rate is usually fixed Y and they M them once  
35:49  
that that Bond matures everybody gets their money out I think everyone understands that simply essentially is a  
35:54  
loan okay someone's making a loan to somebody at a fixed rate of interest and the person that's making the loan isn't going to lend the money themselves  
36:00  
they're going to let everybody else come in and be part of that lending that amount of money being lent so everyone can share in that return correct okay so  
36:07  
it could be a Government Bond could be a corporate bond okay so what's a data Bond exactly the same thing so the  
36:12  
government says do you know what we need some data to do something maybe the data is important to understand an area in  
36:19  
Dubai that people may have that data or maybe they're trying to build something to do with house and they're trying to  
36:24  
the impact of cocoa pops who knows or maybe it's a research company trying  
36:29  
to build you know some medication m and they need they need the data of people they can't get today people may have a  
36:35  
unique allergies or certain things because take covid right even though the the medication was heavily tested  
36:41  
there's always going to be outliers because you just don't have enough testing data to prove but could you  
36:46  
issue a bond to say actually instead of trying to take this data from people why don't you contribute and every time and  
36:53  
then every as we're building this you will get rewarded every time your data is used this is why it's so cool in a  
36:59  
bond I get paid once because it's only for the property but that same data could get used seven times or more or  
37:05  
more which means I get rewarded every time and the government could even take a clip of that take some money off that  
37:11  
as a as a as a revenue generator so the government's making money government's getting data they need and everybody  
37:17  
else is getting rewarded at the same time how is that data for for the average Joe guy goes to work every day  
37:23  
works at KPMG just become partner wife works as I don't know whatever another business she's an accountant let's say  
37:29  
as well and they live a normal life they got two kids they live in Arabian ranches or wherever it may be they they  
37:34  
a very normal life how does that that man that's sitting listening to this right now going holy macaroni this  
37:40  
sounds cool how does he then consciously is he able to harvest and harness his  
37:46  
own data so he will today is going be difficult right let's be H let's be honest there'll be certain data that he  
37:51  
can't get if we use the examples of government with healths that's a lot desperate today there may be some things  
37:57  
though that on your Apple watch and device you can be able to get yourself um could be your step count could be  
38:02  
your heart rate or anything that makes you unique that could easily be given today um and all it would take is a is a  
38:09  
bank to issue a bond I think in Dubai they've just done social bonds um there's no reason why you couldn't do one for data um so what it starts to do  
38:17  
is starts and this is why I hope this happens with people listening they start looking at the data and questioning what  
38:23  
that data means and is it valuable and more importantly is it valuable to them before but is it is it not a case of of  
38:30  
some people will listen to this and go yeah this is really valuable but I don't even  
38:36  
know where to start where where is where is my data you know and it may be this is the infancy  
38:42  
and that's what you're bringing bringing to the world but but you know as we can  
38:47  
clearly currently we can store our cryptocurrency on an exchange or we can store in a store in a cold wallet right  
38:54  
um and so we've got those two options so for those people people that don't know what a cold storage is just think of a  
38:59  
USB stick it's like it's the easiest way to describe it you put it on a USB stick and you put the USB in your pocket  
39:05  
so for for those people wanting to be able to to harness it there will come a  
39:11  
time in the not too dist future where they can literally every piece of data that they produce can be collected in an  
39:17  
automated fashion and go into their storage facility of that and that's when  
39:23  
they're going to have the power over it there'll be companies so there are companies that exist already so this is  
39:29  
not like the fantasy of someone writing this the cool bit is I get the chance to work with people doing it yeah so there's a company I work with in silic  
39:35  
and Valley who are building a data wallet where basically you'll be able to do exactly what I've just described they launch pretty soon where you'll be able  
39:41  
to store your data and have a savings uh product capturing the rewards and value  
39:47  
from your data um there are already companies on the internet where you can pull all your data together in a  
39:52  
community mhm and every time that data is sold you get rewarded every time that data is used us so they could pull that  
39:58  
data together and maybe sell it on like an app store or something like that a Marketplace that people would be familiar with they already exist by the  
40:05  
by the way ex that like a Cooperative basically exactly exactly that so those exist today there's wallets that exist  
40:11  
today there are companies in Saudi Arabia building what I'm describing for health um where people can actually  
40:17  
manage their own health data and do that um there are already other companies in web 3 world which allow people to take  
40:23  
their data that they store on the internet there's even browsers today like Brave and others that tell you and block advertising if you to look after  
40:30  
your data so this is emerging and the biggest move that happened last year which listeners will not know is that  
40:36  
Brazil is the first country in the world to allow its citizens to monetize their own data good old Brazil we love Brazil  
40:42  
lived in Brazil for a few years there you go why the F Brazil um because they built the technology why if Brazil a  
40:49  
developing country as big as it is Amazon covering a big chunk of it why it  
40:55  
is crazy so over the last five years I'd say they've gone on a massive  
41:01  
digitization Journey um I'm not sure if your listeners will be aware of the Pix network but it's a it's a competitive  
41:07  
Network to the traditional payment companies but it's digital so the the fees are a lot cheaper but it makes it  
41:13  
more accessible to everyone so they're almost using those digital rails now to eventually push tokens across them so  
41:19  
now I've got a digital rail that means I can put any type of payment across it whether it be data whether it be Bitcoin it doesn't really matter um so now  
41:26  
they've moved on to this level well actually isn't it time that our citizens got rewarded for how their data is being  
41:32  
used um so that was literally written almost written into law last year this year so there's going for consultation  
41:37  
and then once that becomes law again that could be a reference point for the rest of the world to say well hang on  
41:43  
looks like things are changing and this is why you'll see these companies like even when I started writing my book  
41:48  
there was no one it's taking me that long there's like now 30 40 people I meet all over the world I met people  
41:54  
last week who are doing blockchain for health care in the United Kingdom MH they're working with patients and  
42:00  
they're working with hospitals so they share data with patients and they also make money from that data so this is  
42:06  
happening right now um and that's why this is exciting for me because it won't be the monetization  
42:12  
that's the exciting bit is the things that we've talked about which is the prevention the ability to create your own mini programs to manage your health  
42:19  
to manage your Finance you know talk about utilities that would excite your audience today not many people can  
42:25  
understand Financial products mhm um because unfortunately that's a problem for the banking system because they just  
42:31  
push their products to customers and hope they understand U not all banks do that but when you on your own data and  
42:37  
you have an AI all of a sudden now that will then tailor what it tells you based on your level of understanding and  
42:42  
learning so imagine hold on a minute let's just let's do that another way so everyone can get that because that's big  
42:48  
yeah say that again so imagine today I have a mortgage and I'm given a leaflet  
42:54  
that explains the mortgage to me uhuh everybody's understand that differently based on their literacy level yeah some  
43:00  
people just won't get it yeah but what if your AI knew your educational history  
43:05  
all your experience all your data and then suddenly interpreted that mortgage into a way that you  
43:14  
understood that's the point in all this we have collected a lifetime worth of data and it tells everything about our  
43:21  
past it tells us everything who we are but it also tells us who we could become  
43:26  
and that's really the power when you start connecting all of this stuff because there is so much we've lost  
43:33  
because it's been deleted but there's so much that we could gain because we can't get at it if we could get at it and  
43:39  
connect it we could do so much more and what is making this conversation possible today is because the irony is  
43:46  
all these technologies have come together at the same time and our maturity as a population of acceptance  
43:52  
of technology is a lot higher than it was talk to me about the bit being deleted data being lost that will um I  
43:59  
me I there was a guy in the office that came to me the other day and he said I've just got myself a new phone he said I've just lost 20 years of WhatsApp  
44:05  
messages I'm like I'm not sure you had WhatsApp for 20 years but nonetheless said he said I said and he's got one Samsung phone to another I said well  
44:11  
you've got your Samsung account you can find it no it's gone it's gone it's gone and I was like well you know what that  
44:17  
might be a fresh start cuz if you got 20 years of messages on your phone then what kind of  
44:22  
a life are you living but that aside he he then said to me but you don't realize  
44:28  
he said there's all kinds of clients and leads and opportunities and Business Development chances that now I've lost  
44:34  
and I won't be able to remember so that's that's that's that's a normal guy losing his data on his WhatsApp give me  
44:41  
give me your explanation so he's correct obviously his timeline's not quite accurate um but he is correct  
44:49  
so but the important thing that people need to realize is data is now a cultural artifact as well it's a record  
44:55  
of who we were um 14 million people year ago to the pyramids of Egypt yeah right there's a reason for that because  
45:01  
they're trying to understand the stories of the past that's where they go um data now has become a cultural artifact but  
45:08  
we don't treat it as such so from 1991 to 1995 the internet was never archived  
45:14  
there's very little record of the internet from 1991 to 1995 okay 2009 and  
45:20  
I we're showing our age right 2009 to 2018 was the year of the geoc Cities the Myspace these big dominant um websites  
45:27  
right where people used to write their music put their you know a lot of artists were discovered on my St B right  
45:33  
um and you also got songs music stories everything blogs um all deleted on mypace Geo CI doesn't exist  
45:41  
anymore it's been deleted Gio Ci's gone Myspace gone every piece of information  
45:47  
that was on there downloaded uploaded Sorry by everybody je cities was wiped 35 million users were gone so if you add  
45:55  
up all of the websites that were deleted between 2009 and 2018 just to bring this  
46:00  
to life for your audience that's the equivalent of me standing in front of the New York library and hitting delete and wiping it off the face of the earth  
46:07  
that is half the Vatican archives being deleted that's what that means during covid the my understanding is that the  
46:15  
British Museum and archives struggled to piece Co together because our data is constantly  
46:21  
being deleted because it's not in our control um and also let's go back to  
46:26  
WhatsApp as well let to make your audience think a little bit so I'm going to show My Age Again um  
46:31  
again this demonstrates our lack of can't sit in my studio I know I'm you like you do shave like you're in a  
46:37  
bloody boy bad talk to people about your age I know you're about 25 just want to shave um right so let's talk about this  
46:45  
so if I talk about um if where we going with this so there's the cultural  
46:50  
component yeah and then there's also was what was I saying WhatsApp WhatsApp yeah let's go back to WhatsApp so when we  
46:56  
think of WhatsApp today let's go back to maybe I think it was the early 2000s Rupert Murdo tried to buy  
47:02  
Sky he was told no he went through the competition Authority they said you can't do this because you will have the  
47:07  
Monopoly on news Fair many years later Facebook buys WhatsApp and Instagram my  
47:14  
argument is it's the same thing they now control the news and they control communication this is a a  
47:20  
misunderstanding of not only the cultural example I give in terms of well we don't really understand the think of data as culture MH we also don't think  
47:27  
of data and the companies that manage it as a form of communication and news so it's also a regulatory Gap when so the  
47:34  
lot of the laws that exist today around merges and Acquisitions and competition they don't actually look at why these  
47:40  
companies are buying these technology companies today they're not buying them for other than yes the technology but  
47:47  
also the data that they can generate and they have so we are missing a lot of  
47:52  
things that are on the surface not obvious so there's the data C culture there's there's the data merger and  
47:57  
acquisition there's the data utilization we don't see all of these things have been going on for decades it's just the  
48:04  
fact that AI has exposed them to us is there many people like you out there that are really excited about this  
48:10  
subject matter that you spend time with talking to or is it or is it still very  
48:17  
very early no it's so it's interesting it's almost like you bump into people like the universe wants you to meet them  
48:24  
so I I I tend to bump into people at event saw through the network so I met  
48:30  
the guy from the data wallet through a well-known person and you know he was like me to my brother right he was literally not only talking about a piece  
48:36  
of what I'm talking about like he was building it and he could show me bits of it um and he was involved in the Brazilian regulation um and then i' met  
48:44  
someone recently who's building all the health stuff so the cool thing is I'm meeting lots of people who are building  
48:51  
in the book The Puzzle that I'm describing and we're describing is being built um that's exciting bit so now now  
48:59  
my argument is always the same now we've got the tools we just need the will we need to change the way and that's part  
49:04  
of you know what I'm doing and others like me are doing and part of the the work we're doing to help businesses and  
49:10  
governments rethink this really important asset that's going to become crucial because there's also the people  
49:16  
component in this that I think we' lost as well um which I think they will become even more important with AI Than  
49:22  
People realize I think particularly with data interesting now your book is out when so this te is taking longer than I  
49:29  
thought and that's cuz the world doesn't stop so 2025 so early 2025 is the plan  
49:35  
and the name of the book uh data Revolution the rise of an asset data Revolution the rise of an asset will you  
49:40  
do it for us in audio form as well for people that 100% um So the plan is to do two things actually so the first part of  
49:46  
the book is a voice for a generation to demand change is to show them what data  
49:51  
is and what it became and how it changed and what we Mis outed on but also what could be um this is not sad story um and  
49:58  
then we show them the model to make this work so you've asked all the right questions today um and that's why I  
50:04  
didn't want to leave people hanging and go well okay this is a great book about history what does this mean because I think the talking is over we need  
50:09  
direction now so the second part of the book is the guide book on how to do it so the regulation the model that makes  
50:15  
it work all the things that you've asked me about today will be in there even new curriculums for school even the way the  
50:21  
businesses need to think about hiring people and all the skills that they're going to be needing to make all of this work if you if you if you've got kids at  
50:27  
school and they're seven or eight years old this this is essentially essentially  
50:33  
this is essential as a subject matter for them to learn oh 100% because I I think it's a combination of data and AI  
50:40  
so we're seeing a lot of conversation around curriculums for AI and teaching kids I'm seeing nothing about data and I  
50:47  
think the two go hand inand um I will guarantee something in in three four years time the skills and experiences  
50:54  
that people bring to a business or people have in their own life will become incredibly valuable to businesses  
50:59  
to the point where and I'll show in the book how you can start valuing people's skills because it's those skills are  
51:05  
going to be important to read what AI says but also give the data that AI needs because they're going to come from  
51:11  
people right absolutely okay three tips you can give the man on the street  
51:17  
related to his data that he can sit and and be highly aware of now and get him  
51:23  
into a really conscious state so I think the first thing is have a think about how much data you use every day and what  
51:30  
do you use it for and second is who are you giving that data away to and are  
51:35  
there ways that you can maybe stop that because there are tools on apps that allow you to do it um and there's also  
51:40  
other technologies that you can find on the web that may help you get the most from it I think the third thing is the most important is start thinking about  
51:47  
how you can use that data in your own life to make it better um like I work with my PT constantly and we're using  
51:53  
data to improve my performance or even just simple things like I use data to cure my own health um so start looking  
52:01  
at these things as tools so you know be careful who you give it to understand what you're giving but more importantly  
52:07  
start to build an understanding how you can use it for yourself in ways other than just making money and I guess  
52:12  
there's a fourth one which is look beyond the technology and don't be afraid about AI because actually once  
52:17  
you start understanding your data and you can actually understand how to read it AI starts to become really useful then because it's not really about then  
52:24  
as taking their jobs it's about working with AI to understand these predictive things that we've been talking about incredibly  
52:31  
value Michael God thank you enough for coming and sharing this wisdom with us today it's been fantastic talking to you  
52:36  
thank you so much for joining us no thanks for having me it's been amazing
