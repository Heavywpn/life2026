of**1:44**Buttermilk so you want like a tablespoon**1:46**of salt to one cup of Buttermilk as**1:49**usual the recipe will be in the video**1:57**description all right now that let that**2:00**get to know each other for about minimum**2:02**half an hour maximum 24 hours right so**2:07**since I put that stuff on**2:09**marinade um been in touch with Lil and**2:11**Jake and they're nearby so yep

surprised you have a child yeah**2:47**your**2:50**accuracy um all right let's get back to**2:53**cooking okay so let's get started with**2:57**salsa so we're going to do salsa now**2:59**because we need that to get to kind of**3:01**know each other for a bit and then once**3:04**it's got to know each other get the**3:06**right knife um once got to know each**3:09**other it'll taste better so start off**3:11**with some red**3:13**onion cuz we are going to do actually**3:15**mentioned this yet going to do fried**3:17**chicken tacos so we are going to use**3:21**Harry's Fried Chicken my fried**3:24**chicken spice um you don't need to use**3:27**that just Google your favorite fried**3:30**chicken spice mix and make it yourself**3:32**but I worked out that it's actually**3:33**cheaper to buy that than it is to buy**3:35**the spices cuz that has**3:38**like 14 spices um there's a lot that**3:42**goes into it and you buy you pay sort of**3:44**two or three bucks for each one and then**3:46**one of them you need two of them and you**3:48**know all of a sudden you just end up**3:49**with crap everywhere and you**3:52**spent half an hour mixing a spice mix**3:55**when you could have spent a small amount**3:57**of money buying one**4:00**um I'm not trying to say that to sell**4:02**them I'm saying it because that's the**4:04**reason I made it um was to save people**4:12**time that is a lot of red onion so I'm**4:14**going to keep some of that to the side**4:15**because we don't need that much in the**4:18**salsa oh I got an itchy nose which means**4:21**people are going to
