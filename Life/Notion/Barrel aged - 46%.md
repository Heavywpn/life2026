# What did I think.

## Summary

This barrel-aged gin presents a unique profile, blending traditional juniper-forward characteristics with nuanced flavors imparted by the barrel-aging process. While the initial aroma is intriguing, with hints of cola and subtle botanicals, the palate reveals a lighter body and mild complexity. This gin is better suited as a mixer rather than a standalone sipper, and it pairs exceptionally well with light, refreshing foods. Its subdued flavor profile makes it versatile for cocktails, especially when combined with soda.

### Tasting Notes

1. **Appearance**: Pale golden hue, likely from the barrel-aging process, with a clear and clean presentation.
2. **Nose**: Cola-like sweetness on the opening, balanced by gentle juniper and a faint hint of oak.
3. **Palate (First Sip)**: Light and approachable, with mild physical texture; juniper is present but not overpowering.
4. **Mid-Palate**: Subtle notes of vanilla, caramel, and a faint spiciness from the aging process.
5. **Finish**: Short and clean, with a slightly flat aftertaste that leaves room for mixers to shine.
6. **Balance**: Well-rounded but lacking depth or bold flavors; better suited for blending than sipping neat.
7. **Versatility**: Best enjoyed with soda water, as tonic water may overpower its subtler flavors.
8. **Food Pairings**: Complements light dishes such as grilled chicken, fresh seafood, or a citrus salad.
9. **Overall Impression**: A good gin for casual mixing, but it may not appeal to those seeking bold or complex barrel-aged spirits.
10. **Recommendation**: Ideal for summer gatherings or as a base for creative cocktails that enhance its delicate sweetness.
