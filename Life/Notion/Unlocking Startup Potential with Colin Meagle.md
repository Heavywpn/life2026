appreciate your time today delighted to00:02:11.560 be here ready to go I've got to know you00:02:14.000 over the course of the last few months00:02:15.879 and been fascinated by your story what00:02:18.920 you do as a businessman how you live00:02:20.920 your life and the philosophies that you00:02:23.440 follow and for me trying to partner up00:02:27.879 some of the ways that you do business00:02:29.959 along with how you think okay and how00:02:31.680 you operate as a human being is00:02:33.040 something that I've really wanted to try00:02:34.319 and get to the bottom of and learn about00:02:36.480 for my own benefit but also with00:02:38.560 everybody that consumes this content and00:02:40.239 this podcast I want really people to00:02:41.840 take some real valuable lessons for this00:02:43.519 today so first of all let's just start00:02:46.080 off with a bit of a background on on00:02:47.519 your business okay and your business00:02:49.599 career so we can give people some00:02:50.879 context and then we're going to dive00:02:52.000 into a few other areas and then00:02:53.280 hopefully we'll just patch it all up00:02:54.680 together and people will see why you are00:02:57.040 who you are and why you do what you do00:02:59.360 okay well I started I studied uh primary00:03:02.640 Business Degree with French business00:03:04.440 process or engineering so I was always00:03:05.959 kind of process-led but not technology00:03:08.400 was all strategy uh you couldn't do that00:03:11.440 uh without embracing technology and very00:03:14.400 very early on like 1995 96 I got00:03:17.560 introduced to the internet and I was00:03:19.560 actually working in IBM at the time in00:03:21.120 Dublin and I was basically still a00:03:23.400 student and I remember just thinking wow00:03:25.120 this is this has got reached this has00:03:27.159 got benefit so I kind of decided to take00:03:30.040 my career on on on that as a medium and00:03:32.840 so I started by understanding the00:03:35.159 mathematics behind building networks00:03:36.879 tcpip and so on which my brain really00:03:39.239 only started working in college so then00:03:41.080 things made sense to me in terms of how00:03:42.519 you map things out and uh then I started00:03:45.159 lecturing on that started talking about00:03:46.560 it and teaching people and bringing00:03:48.159 people along and started getting00:03:50.400 insights into how people receive00:03:52.720 information because you know you're00:03:54.239 there lecturing on these pretty tough00:03:56.319 topics but you're saying the same thing00:03:58.599 week after week uh but you see them00:04:00.640 taking it in for the first time or not00:04:02.239 taking it in and it it teaches you a lot00:04:04.480 about how people absorb information how00:04:07.200 they bounces off them sometimes and00:04:08.720 things like that because to you it's00:04:10.480 autopilot so you can focus on them00:04:12.640 rather than what's coming out of your00:04:14.239 mouth you know it inside out and uh so00:04:16.160 that was really interesting and that00:04:17.720 kind of led me to to a lot of00:04:19.639 realizations00:04:21.040 about tech and people because you got00:04:23.759 people who they wanted to look good in00:04:25.360 their jobs they were good at marketing00:04:26.960 or something else and then suddenly00:04:28.400 there's this internet thing that they00:04:29.720 they have to understand I wasn't a00:04:32.199 techie I couldn't go deep on this stuff00:04:34.000 I I but I started working with people00:04:35.960 who could and I kind of made a career00:04:37.960 for myself out of being in that bridge00:04:40.160 between the human problem and and00:04:43.360 technology so then I got into uh00:04:46.880 internet development companies from00:04:48.520 there and then in 2002 I started my00:04:51.360 first startup I actually moved home to00:04:53.440 my parents uh house went up to the attic00:04:56.360 rolled out a carpet and made a deal with00:04:58.120 them and said look I I'm using my00:04:59.680 apartment savings to pay for other staff00:05:02.080 but um if I can work here I'll just make00:05:05.039 sure there's always good wine in the00:05:06.160 fridge and we shook hands on that and00:05:07.680 that was it I started there then I moved00:05:10.360 to my first office because I could I00:05:12.880 could pay a monthly rent first so I00:05:14.479 didn't have to commit to a long-term00:05:15.919 lease and that was above a shop and that00:05:18.160 was disastrous because the boardroom we00:05:20.880 had I I had bought a a table in a00:05:24.080 liquidation sale from an old friend of00:05:25.800 mine which was huge and in our front00:05:29.120 room which was a converted bedroom or00:05:30.800 boardroom as we call it if there's more00:05:32.639 than five people in the room the floor00:05:34.199 started to give so if a client arrived00:05:36.520 with more than two people with I might00:05:37.919 have to say to one of my staff go out00:05:39.400 the back door I'll tell them you're sick00:05:40.680 because we couldn't admit that the floor00:05:41.919 was caving in and we only had one you00:05:44.960 there was about a 12we lead time for an00:05:46.880 internet cable for ISDN it's 12800:05:50.039 kilobyte so we had one phone cable there00:05:52.800 was six staff one phone cable and uh the00:05:55.560 debate every day was who's got the00:05:57.039 internet so we were a web agency00:05:59.080 pitching for these these large00:06:00.800 contracts and uh we'd have debates every00:06:03.080 day why do you need the internet today00:06:04.479 and you like why you get this proposal00:06:06.160 at your client why do you need it and00:06:07.840 the tech you like if I don't start00:06:08.960 uploading the website today it won't be00:06:10.880 there by 8:00 in the morning okay you00:06:13.319 win so that was a Continuum that was my00:06:15.880 first startup and uh I'd call it00:06:18.199 Continuum because I wanted an ongoing00:06:20.080 relationship with with uh customers it00:06:22.919 started as being Continuum Technologies00:06:24.520 but the Technologies word aged really00:06:26.960 really quickly so I very quickly pivoted00:06:29.240 to kind of make it about people and uh00:06:31.599 we did very well we grew up and then and00:06:33.639 then in 2015 I overleveraged myself and00:06:36.560 then broke that out into a group so we00:06:38.680 had uh a lot more opportunities for00:06:41.080 growth there because people were coming00:06:42.800 to agencies saying I need a thing built00:06:44.720 I've got this budget this time scale and00:06:46.720 it has to do the following and I really00:06:48.960 want to get ahead of that say well how00:06:51.360 did you make all those decisions how do00:06:52.599 you know they're the right decisions and00:06:54.199 they typically didn't have answers so00:06:56.360 then we went towards what was called00:06:58.000 digital transformation which was getting00:06:59.759 ahead of that and you'd go in and write00:07:02.000 the road map with them and keep more00:07:04.039 importantly get the benefit of the doubt00:07:05.639 from them that you know let's talk about00:07:08.240 the proposal before you decide selling00:07:10.479 this to North America is the plan you00:07:13.120 challenge that idea but what it also00:07:15.680 meant then is that suddenly you were00:07:17.039 influential on how they went to B00:07:19.280 business and then suddenly you were00:07:20.319 winning business by default so we could00:07:22.199 start much earlier than a lot of our00:07:23.680 competition and then we could end much00:07:25.680 further because then we went into cyber00:07:28.120 security we went into hosting we went00:07:29.840 into00:07:30.720 24/7 uh support so you couldn't have00:07:34.199 full-time Engineers all the time but we00:07:35.879 had Partnerships with places that had00:07:38.160 24-hour Network operating centers and00:07:40.120 you just hand them a run book after 5:3000:07:42.720 at night so you were able to then00:07:45.520 support your clients 247 for a lot00:07:47.319 cheaper than a lot of your competition00:07:49.319 and there was still an escalation00:07:50.919 process um but when we started I mean I00:07:53.639 had a one-page website that was an extr00:07:56.840 net it said please enter your your00:07:58.400 username and password to log in cuz it00:08:01.199 was completely bootstrapped right and no00:08:03.440 matter what you put in there it just00:08:04.680 came back with oh I'm sorry your00:08:06.120 username is incorrect please contact00:08:07.879 sales at this number for extra support00:08:10.319 which rang my mobile directly and I00:08:12.680 remember when I won my first big00:08:14.039 contract uh it was actually Nissan and00:08:16.720 uh I remember the guys asked me do we00:08:18.120 get access to your Swanky externet now I00:08:20.280 said no no no you get me fulltime you00:08:21.960 get all of our service so it you know it00:08:24.680 was it was a bit of a bit of that it was00:08:26.800 very very critical path um very much00:08:29.039 about um being very deliberate there's a00:08:31.520 word I overuse which is the word00:08:32.958 deliberate but it was it was about being00:08:34.719 very very specific and very deliberate00:08:36.360 both in terms of what you were doing00:08:38.360 more importantly what you weren't doing00:08:40.440 and uh you know the people that you went00:08:42.479 along with you know it's a it's a space00:08:44.720 where you have to admit very quickly I00:08:46.519 just don't understand that or I I know00:08:48.680 what to get out of that person or that00:08:50.320 Tech or that skill and and how to pull00:08:52.600 it together and as that evolved into a00:08:54.399 group and we started getting much bigger00:08:55.880 clients and much longer contracts and a00:08:57.920 lot more dependencies00:08:59.880 you know I remember being challenged One00:09:01.320 Day by a very large International firm00:09:03.000 the head of marketing and she said00:09:04.360 you're the guy I never meet again once I00:09:06.720 sign this contract and I said I'm the00:09:09.480 guy that's responsible to make sure you00:09:11.320 have the right people in front of you at00:09:12.560 the right time and if that doesn't00:09:14.360 happen then I'm the guy you call and she00:09:16.440 said fair enough and she signed a00:09:17.480 multiion contract on that and and that00:09:20.040 was kind of that was the approach um but00:09:22.480 it was you know hard yards I went00:09:24.600 through two recessions a pandemic uh and00:09:28.680 I built up into a group I sold U most00:09:31.680 Parts anything that had staff um I sold00:09:35.079 I was taking a break I had lost00:09:36.440 unfortunately one or two members of my00:09:37.680 family and just decided to take a break00:09:39.560 so sold all of that and kept the00:09:41.560 investment stuff which brings us up to00:09:45.200 2018 uh where I live now is continuous00:09:47.760 Ventures uh and how I'd started that was00:09:51.800 as a give back as a CS so we did lots of00:09:54.240 Charity websites and projects and I went00:09:56.160 to Africa for years I went to Chernobyl00:09:57.920 I went to all these places because I had00:09:59.839 that freedom you know the tech was going00:10:01.519 well the business was going well I was00:10:03.000 free and single I was just enjoying00:10:05.240 other things in life I played music I00:10:07.040 wrote all these things uh and it was00:10:09.440 nice it was very very fulfilling uh as00:10:11.760 part of that and you know to be honest00:10:13.839 I'd become a bit complacent about00:10:15.120 business it kind of ran itself and I was00:10:16.839 like okay well I can now do this in my00:10:18.959 sleep and now just es and flows with00:10:21.240 society and values and markets and so on00:10:24.240 so it's doing other things but one thing00:10:25.920 that I really got struck by was the00:10:28.320 amount of mistakes that's startups we're00:10:30.279 making and uh as our give back instead00:10:33.600 of doing all the charity stuff which is00:10:35.079 extremely important but I found that the00:10:37.519 ask never changed it was just we need00:10:39.320 more of the same we need more of the00:10:40.560 same More Money More investment we'd00:10:42.320 build websites extr Nets things like00:10:44.959 that for them just as a as a giveaway00:10:46.639 just best of luck with that and and you00:10:48.639 know it was very important work00:10:51.480 extremely important but it was a lot of00:10:53.079 the same and the biggest lesson it00:10:55.760 taught me was about you know I mean you00:10:58.360 focus on the power content for for your00:11:00.880 for your living for what we're doing00:11:02.320 right here but in agency world you kind00:11:04.839 of it's about the impact of the message00:11:06.639 for the customer or the customer's00:11:08.200 customer and so on but I remember we00:11:09.800 were doing a website for a kids00:11:11.240 orphanage and a a Content update update00:11:14.560 came up to the design team and they just00:11:17.200 said uh can you remove the pictures of00:11:18.959 those three girls because they've all00:11:20.120 passed away and they were all like 10 1200:11:22.079 years of age and the impact in the00:11:24.480 office I can still get the Goosebumps00:11:26.240 now it hit the place like a tsunami it00:11:28.639 was just this00:11:30.440 Frozen vacuum of feeling that they the00:11:34.079 impact of that for designers and00:11:35.880 developers there was tears there was00:11:37.279 everything and you get that a lot with00:11:40.000 you know charity projects some of your00:11:41.959 most calm and quiet staff could be ones00:11:45.279 that feel the most passionate about a00:11:47.720 particular cause or particular um you00:11:50.120 know charity or or proposal um but I00:11:53.839 just remember the uniformity of of of00:11:56.200 everyone's feelings and that I was just00:11:57.519 sudden like oh God this is this is00:11:58.959 really real it's not just web stuff so I00:12:02.240 decided after that it was one of those00:12:04.320 kind of moments I just thought I need00:12:06.440 this needs to be about real people how00:12:08.040 we help Society sh about real real00:12:10.279 people so what it did was every second00:12:12.600 Thursday because we built out a group00:12:14.120 with a lot of senior people um every00:12:16.639 second Thursday I would advise for free00:12:19.079 with startups and just put it out there00:12:21.160 you i' kind of grown up in business in00:12:22.760 Dublin was well known in business terms00:12:25.199 particularly in Internet terms in Dublin00:12:27.360 and so just put Linked In and things00:12:29.920 like that you know with a little bit of00:12:31.800 pre-qualification we'll look at some of00:12:33.519 these things and then again because I00:12:35.959 wouldn't understand it fully I'd pull in00:12:37.800 you know CTO or design or development or00:12:40.920 strategy and then this kind of formula00:12:43.399 was born00:12:45.000 where I could make these very senior00:12:47.240 people that were sunken cost to us I00:12:49.480 could make them available to these00:12:50.760 startups just to help them avoid the00:12:52.519 mistakes that I made you know they say00:12:54.440 an expert is somebody who's made every00:12:56.000 mistake in a focused area uh I was00:12:58.880 definitely an expert for making all00:13:01.000 those mistakes and it was great00:13:02.680 satisfaction in just helping them00:13:04.639 reverse out of situations that they'00:13:06.639 caught up you know every every company00:13:08.639 has challenges that to them is00:13:11.000 completely new but you start seeing it00:13:12.519 on a routine basis you're like oh i'00:13:14.399 just I'd caution you there or let's just00:13:16.920 have another look at that and you try00:13:18.279 and draw it out of them rather than tell00:13:19.959 them you know um the language you use is00:13:22.720 very important but I was used to dealing00:13:24.160 with super bright people far brighter00:13:26.079 than me I like being the dumbest guy in00:13:27.839 every room particularly the team I've00:13:29.440 recently uh built and uh so the language00:13:33.120 you use is kind of supportive but coxing00:13:35.079 you know you firm on topics not on00:13:36.720 people and things like that and uh and00:13:39.519 then you know when when you needed to be00:13:40.959 a bit stronger with them you could be00:13:42.480 and then that led to being chairman of00:13:44.240 one or two things and I personally00:13:45.639 invested in a few of these startups but00:13:48.519 the energy that came from these as I saw00:13:51.519 them kids I mean they weren't but they00:13:53.720 were kids and and uh excited00:13:57.079 entrepreneurs and first timers and and00:13:59.120 midtimes and all this kind of stuff it00:14:01.680 just reinvigorated me towards the00:14:03.519 strategy of business and the ABS and00:14:05.120 flows and you know my kind of best00:14:08.040 definition of an entrepreneur is is is00:14:10.199 somebody who creates unlimited results00:14:13.199 out of often limited to no means by use00:14:16.199 of their their focus their ability to00:14:18.399 harness Talent harness people and00:14:19.920 resources and opportunities around them00:14:21.639 to to see their purpose through and you00:14:24.519 just trying to put that into these guys00:14:26.399 or you know or Draw it out of them some00:14:27.959 of them are amazing but they can't talk00:14:30.560 to somebody they can they can explain00:14:32.680 the best mathematics in the world but00:14:34.320 you put them in a room with a pretty00:14:35.920 girl and they go red and stare at the00:14:38.040 floor you know everyone needed strength00:14:40.360 at different times but certainly the00:14:43.199 model for continuous Ventures was born00:14:45.240 out of that fact that apart from the00:14:47.040 advisory and the investment making very00:14:50.199 Senior People available to these00:14:51.680 startups so they're not burning their00:14:53.199 own cash all the time you see these00:14:54.720 startups they raise a million or two and00:14:57.360 then before you know they've hired00:14:58.440 people they don't how to use properly00:15:00.040 they're underutilized even from a time00:15:01.839 and cost point of view and they're00:15:03.600 burning cash and suddenly the pressure's00:15:05.279 on and they probably got a a bear of an00:15:07.600 investor sitting at the boardroom table00:15:09.199 tapping the00:15:10.519 table so we could just absorb that into00:15:13.000 our model and and then kind of00:15:14.680 facilitate the conduit for startups and00:15:17.199 that's what I do know00:15:19.959 wow let's talk about digital00:15:22.000 transformation because I think it's a00:15:24.399 term that's that's widely used that most00:15:27.480 people don't really understand so can00:15:29.120 you explain to me what it is and give me00:15:30.920 an00:15:31.600 example yes uh one of the things about00:15:34.000 digital transformation is defining what00:15:35.720 it isn't uh every company will say we00:15:38.199 want to be you know we want to do a00:15:40.360 digital transformation program and we're00:15:42.160 going to be the best in our field or00:15:43.519 we're going to be you know leading the00:15:45.480 market and so00:15:46.639 on companies want digital transformation00:15:49.199 until you try and change something and00:15:50.759 then they realize they just want digital00:15:52.360 efficiency they want it faster a little00:15:54.560 bit more accurate or better or shinier00:15:57.519 but when you say okay we're going to00:15:59.480 totally recalibrate how you do your00:16:01.079 business how you talk to your customer00:16:02.480 where you where your customer is or what00:16:03.920 channels you go to market or a big one00:16:06.959 is what do you do with your data do you00:16:09.360 you gather loads of data have you any00:16:11.079 insight on what that data00:16:12.959 is and then you try and you you try and00:16:15.560 recalibrate you try and change it find00:16:17.440 new rootes to Market an example I gave00:16:19.560 was you get the airline business they00:16:21.680 know you're flying from from Dublin to00:16:23.720 Dubai and you're flying you know at on00:16:26.240 this date you've booked it in a certain00:16:27.959 language you're your you know business00:16:30.319 or first or economy class you know what00:16:33.160 airport you're going to how long you're00:16:34.680 staying all of that00:16:36.199 data and the airline business started00:16:38.399 kind of transforming that to say okay00:16:40.120 well then we can start making00:16:41.319 assumptions and now it's done with more00:16:42.880 AI but it was more kind of digital00:16:45.319 suppositions before to say okay well00:16:47.800 you're traveling with two kids so you00:16:49.639 possibly need a car and you possibly00:16:51.440 need to return it on this day so here's00:16:52.920 a guest average of a three star level00:16:55.720 car at this price or three star level00:16:58.639 hot hotel or five star level Hotel00:17:00.680 depending on your profile and you know I00:17:03.920 I remember working on that a long long00:17:05.559 time ago for Rhino http://hotels.com/ for00:17:07.799 example and they they in the first year00:17:10.000 they increased the revenue by 11% just00:17:12.079 by changing that one thing and that's a00:17:14.799 you know it's using your data to reach00:17:17.199 your customer in a in a deeper way not00:17:19.280 in a new way because you've already sold00:17:21.000 to them but now you're saying let's00:17:22.119 let's solve those problems for you as00:17:23.520 well and in this in the spirit of00:17:26.000 critical thinking and deliberate00:17:27.679 thinking it's it's how do you nail the00:17:30.679 job to be done you know and old elector00:17:32.760 mind you say that how do you nail the00:17:34.160 job to be done getting that one thing00:17:37.039 right that is a pain for a customer and00:17:39.679 you solve it and it's that thing of you00:17:41.600 don't buy a drill because you need a00:17:42.799 drill you buy a drill because you need a00:17:44.160 hole so so can can I maybe take an00:17:47.360 example within my business about how00:17:49.840 that would apply then so so one of my00:17:51.760 businesses is an insurance brokerage00:17:54.039 that insurance brokerage predominantly00:17:55.799 sells medical insurance okay now our00:17:58.559 client have other insurance needs but we00:18:01.039 predominantly focus on medical insurance00:18:03.799 but the buyer or the decision maker00:18:07.400 would be the HR Director followed by the00:18:11.080 CFO who would sign it off so HR Director00:18:13.080 does the leg work CFO signs it off make00:18:14.960 sure they've got the budget to do00:18:16.559 it we have a requirement to potentially00:18:19.919 Sell gratuiti Solutions to companies00:18:22.320 here the same decision maker is involved00:18:25.159 on a B2B basis really because the HR00:18:27.240 Director and the CFO are the ones that00:18:28.520 were the decisions about that kind of00:18:30.120 stuff so am why on the clock now am I am00:18:32.280 I00:18:34.360 good I just because I want I want to00:18:36.400 give everyone context if we could we we00:18:38.200 we could do it there because I think00:18:39.200 that was a b Toc model and and and00:18:41.440 because digital transformation I think00:18:42.799 would apply to B2B of course as well00:18:44.440 yeah yeah it's where most of the most of00:18:46.120 the work is so the work that you'd be00:18:47.960 doing is you potentially would be00:18:49.679 looking at that saying right you're00:18:50.720 sending to this type of customer this00:18:53.039 type of product or service what other00:18:54.880 the problems do they have and how can I00:18:57.600 solve other problems that they've got00:18:59.679 because they've already made a00:19:00.640 commitment to be a customer anyway and00:19:02.679 how can I do that in a more digitally00:19:05.039 effective process yeah in fact the the00:19:08.200 example you give is is a very00:19:09.919 interesting and easier one to solve00:19:12.080 although it's it's big pieces of work00:19:14.440 and the first thing you do is you know00:19:15.880 you say for example a HR Director um00:19:18.600 would be would be involved in in signing00:19:20.480 off on that for a company so00:19:22.760 particularly in Dubai you've got a legal00:19:24.200 requirement to provide certain levels of00:19:25.640 health insurance and so on and then00:19:26.919 depending on the profile of the staff00:19:28.400 you might at various00:19:30.000 levels so you got that but then you look00:19:32.960 at the problems that the HR Director or00:19:36.679 chief people officer has so actually up00:19:39.080 until recently and a client to00:19:40.280 continuous is a company called covis and00:19:42.480 they're like the Harvard Business review00:19:43.960 of strategy for chief people officers00:19:46.280 right so when the you know the chief00:19:48.320 people officer of Pepsi gets asked00:19:50.120 what's our working from home policy post00:19:52.080 pandemic they turn to academics to say00:19:55.120 well you know firstly prove it secondly00:19:57.720 give me a template for in that out00:19:59.320 across my staff across the world so if00:20:01.840 you look at that person's um profile and00:20:05.039 problem it's typically a mid toate uh00:20:08.039 director female and in in that role but00:20:12.280 then if you think of let's say her00:20:15.280 her uh customers and her customers are00:20:18.039 the staff so then you take anything that00:20:20.559 you're signing and passing through like00:20:22.240 Insurance whether it's medical insurance00:20:24.559 whether it's car insurance pet insurance00:20:26.159 doesn't matter that's solving a problem00:20:28.080 for her C customer who is the the staff00:20:30.240 member so then you follow the data down00:20:32.840 to them and you say okay well I've also00:20:34.559 noticed that you have a husband and00:20:36.440 husband is a separate policy someplace00:20:38.120 else okay so let's let's get efficient00:20:40.360 here about cross- selling and we'll00:20:41.919 offer a family discount that's the easy00:20:44.039 stuff okay but then you start saying00:20:46.159 okay how are we going to separate00:20:47.280 ourselves apart and this is really where00:20:48.840 digital transformation kicks in because00:20:50.440 you then say right we know from the00:20:53.480 profile of the staff that that person00:20:55.840 maybe the CFO of the same company is a00:20:58.280 50 year old man and you know he's always00:21:01.720 asking about Family Insurance00:21:03.240 particularly maybe insurance for his00:21:05.120 father or something and then you go down00:21:07.000 that rabbit hole and you say okay his00:21:09.240 father is Alzheimer's he's no power of00:21:11.600 attorney with his father's data you00:21:13.720 think of where that medical data sits00:21:15.559 does it sit in a hospital does it sit in00:21:17.400 his in his pocket has a bunch of00:21:18.960 doctor's notes and can you digitize that00:21:21.799 and if you can digitize that then you00:21:24.159 can you're your that person can be00:21:26.240 authorized to maybe make decisions for00:21:28.640 father about his medication renewing his00:21:30.880 prescriptions anything like that so00:21:32.600 you're solving very very personal00:21:34.720 problems for people you're doing it in a00:21:36.799 very data efficient way and you're00:21:39.480 you're kind of going down the rabbit00:21:40.880 hole of of every individual need and00:21:43.600 that's how you kind of get you know00:21:45.320 loyalty and stickiness with these00:21:46.799 Platforms in a world of a million apps00:21:49.200 right it's the ones that you know really00:21:51.919 channel the life blood of people's00:21:53.880 problems is where you'll find the money00:21:55.919 and they will say if you if you solve00:21:57.320 one problem a person has on a recurring00:21:59.400 basis you'll make a couple of million00:22:00.720 dollars in in in those apps but it's00:22:03.200 just in those processes the ability to00:22:05.799 breathe life into following the data and00:22:09.440 solving those problems for everybody so00:22:11.919 then you say okay we sell00:22:14.159 insurance but you can self tailor that00:22:16.960 insurance the company is paying for your00:22:18.559 insurance but we're going to give you00:22:20.000 through our platform or through app the00:22:21.880 ability to really self- tailor that so00:22:24.360 you've got you've got a a a blanket00:22:26.440 coverage or you can maybe upself for00:22:28.720 blank coverage and here's multiple00:22:31.000 scenarios everyone typically has a00:22:32.919 mother or father or somebody that might00:22:35.400 be unwell or somebody that's just been00:22:36.960 born or you just never know but you can00:22:39.679 you can suppose those scenarios and then00:22:42.320 you can provide processes and data for00:22:44.640 that and then once you do that you can00:22:47.240 go further down the rabbit hole and say00:22:49.200 okay this person is a diabetic okay we00:22:51.320 should set up relationships with00:22:52.600 diabetic firms to get bulk purchasing of00:22:55.919 this and make it available through the00:22:57.200 app as well so now suddenly were a super00:22:59.159 app because we're we're ordering we're00:23:01.400 now a logistics company right we're00:23:03.480 ordering um you know insulin or we're00:23:06.360 ordering headache tablets or blood00:23:08.039 pressure tablets or whatever and then00:23:10.360 you know you kind of go down that route00:23:12.559 I looked at a project before where we00:23:14.279 wanted00:23:15.200 to revolutionize the concept of a first00:23:18.120 aid kit we wanted to make a first aid00:23:19.840 kit or the concept of a first aid kit a00:23:22.200 smart device in a home so you think of00:23:24.520 the tech involved in in um opening your00:23:26.799 phone uh with your face or recording00:23:29.559 your voice or whatever if you had a sick00:23:31.480 parent the machine could bleep for the00:23:33.679 parent to come along it could dispense a00:23:35.880 tablet record that person taking the00:23:38.440 tablet talk them through the process00:23:40.400 reorder if necessary because it's a00:23:42.200 secure device with with digital00:23:44.159 encryption and then you as a son could00:23:46.799 be sent a little video oh yeah Dad took00:23:48.440 his medicine soor great solved so that's00:23:51.720 kind of how you you you lean into a00:23:53.559 process like insurance which in in00:23:55.799 Insurance worlds can just be erased to00:23:57.159 the bottom it can be price price price00:23:58.600 and and what's available for what00:24:00.640 different profile of insurance level you00:24:02.360 have but there's so much more to it if00:24:04.559 you make it about the human then you00:24:06.919 wrap the process around the human then00:24:08.559 you've got a bigger Market got it okay00:24:12.960 so the way that you describe everything00:24:15.520 clearly very intelligent around that but00:24:18.480 and and as you as you explain your00:24:19.720 journey apart from being at the00:24:20.880 beginning where up in the attic there00:24:22.440 and not really having much money behind00:24:24.000 you and boardroom tables that are a00:24:25.480 little bit too heavy and so on00:24:28.760 talk to me about because we always talk00:24:30.159 about the winds don't we we hear a lot00:24:31.919 about how someone turned this into this00:24:33.559 into this and it was yes B an IPO and Y00:24:35.799 didly everyone got very rich but you00:24:38.360 also spoke about how when when you when00:24:40.640 you look at people that have said00:24:41.720 setting up companies the ones that have00:24:43.200 failed before okay if you've made the00:24:45.720 mistakes then you'll you you they've00:24:47.240 probably been costly in the early stages00:24:49.039 and so you've learned some really00:24:50.039 valuable lessons yes tell me about a00:24:52.440 business that you got involved with that00:24:55.360 you look back now and you're like I wish00:24:58.000 I never did that but I got some valuable00:25:00.039 lessons from it um yes uh I remember00:25:03.440 being on on uh the chairman on a minor00:25:07.159 shareholder in a in a project with Nile00:25:10.000 Horn you know from One Direction okay00:25:12.399 and uh it was in Nile Emoji so it was he00:25:15.799 consulted with our designers to create00:25:17.480 different emojis of his face all00:25:20.120 selected by him and signed off by him00:25:22.480 and then when he released his album uh00:25:25.559 it was I think it his first solo album00:25:27.240 maybe his second solo album00:25:29.120 um we released this at the same time00:25:30.919 with his Blessing like he was part he00:25:32.360 was a director in the firm and and a00:25:33.919 shareholder and we released it and it00:25:36.679 was a lot of work and it was a lot of00:25:38.480 advertising also amazing to see the00:25:41.360 power of celebrity endorsement because00:25:43.360 as soon as it went out on his Instagram00:25:45.640 and his Twitter and his Facebook at the00:25:48.360 time you literally you saw okay five00:25:51.399 likes 10 likes th000 likes 5,000 likes00:25:54.399 15,000 likes I've literally videos of it00:25:56.520 just it was just incredible that reach00:25:59.679 and uh you know because that was you00:26:02.520 know I knew some older celebrities being00:26:04.480 Ireland is a small place right you know00:26:06.039 some of the old singers and actors and00:26:07.399 so on but um the the kind of kidy Markus00:26:11.640 I'm watching The Power of of the act the00:26:13.600 hive of activity and so on but00:26:16.120 interestingly it was the day of the00:26:18.080 launch of the album people were00:26:20.600 delighted to by the album and then they00:26:21.960 complained like helled spending 99 cents00:26:24.120 on a set of emojis so our guys are00:26:27.279 watching this we're saying okay well00:26:28.480 we'll do a competition if you get you00:26:30.679 know 50 likes we'll send it to you for00:26:32.120 free kind of stuff and but it was just00:26:35.080 uh just did not work the whole thing all00:26:37.919 the work everything it just didn't work00:26:39.640 and and we thought we'd leverage the00:26:42.399 love that he has from the audience and00:26:44.440 so on and uh sorry now but um it just it00:26:49.480 helped reinforce probably his album00:26:51.039 sales so I'm sure he did well out of it00:26:52.640 but as a business I think it made about00:26:54.679 20 grand and it didn't it didn't cover00:26:57.200 anything at all um another one I had was00:27:00.640 was a takeaway from that you know you00:27:01.960 sat there and you know if you had to go00:27:04.039 back and do that again was that you00:27:05.320 learning that um the youngsters 99900:27:08.600 cents was just a step too much for them00:27:10.720 after buying the album or yeah I mean00:27:13.640 it's it's it's really about the power of00:27:16.080 the grow to Market strategy uh I'm not00:27:18.720 particularly adapt at thinking like a00:27:20.240 12-year-old girl and nor do I want to be00:27:23.000 um and but that's what it took to know00:27:24.919 if this was a good idea or not00:27:26.360 technically it worked beautifully00:27:28.679 integrated beautifully it was aligned00:27:30.799 brand on on point and on message all of00:27:33.360 those bits were absolutely right and you00:27:34.960 never know where the weak point is going00:27:36.600 to be and the weak point was in the00:27:39.279 acceptance of a 99 Cents purchase uh by00:27:43.240 by a 12-year-old fan and you just didn't00:27:48.360 get it do we didn't catch it and that's00:27:49.919 the go to market piece so and this00:27:52.320 happens very frequently with with00:27:54.640 technology-led startups they nail00:27:57.320 something new they do an amazing00:27:58.760 technical job of looking at something00:28:00.480 and and saying this is a brand new way00:28:01.960 of doing it but what they don't do is00:28:05.200 they connect it to the customer in in in00:28:07.880 the customer's terms and I suppose the00:28:10.000 lesson of that was doing it in a00:28:12.320 digestible way by the customer rather00:28:14.080 than what we thought they needed to hear00:28:16.039 or that we thought they wanted and00:28:18.360 sometimes you're inventing out of00:28:19.240 nothing so like here's a surprise thing00:28:21.080 same as an mden launch here's also an00:28:22.600 emoji go celebrate Nile didn't00:28:25.480 work interesting now00:28:28.760 how many how many startups have you got00:28:30.360 involved with if you count them in total00:28:33.000 oh uh 20 over the years and how many did00:28:37.399 you to choose 20 how many did you have00:28:39.960 come across your desk I'd love to be00:28:43.039 very strategic and say oh 700 in my team00:28:45.840 but up up until about three years ago00:28:47.679 I'd say I anything that came across my00:28:49.559 desk that I worked on um I I was00:28:52.440 involving in one way or other because I00:28:54.000 had a vicious appetite for but part of00:28:56.240 that process was consuming them to sort00:28:58.559 of go yeah it's never going to work and00:29:00.600 fine-tuning that process for myself and00:29:02.840 bringing people along in that process00:29:04.880 but very interesting when when covid00:29:06.880 happened and agency work diminished uh00:29:09.880 you know obviously because like we still00:29:12.480 had Nissan as a client I remember they00:29:13.799 rang me to say we haven't sold a car in00:29:15.679 six months you know and we need to00:29:17.159 reverse the project we were going to do00:29:18.919 but we'll talk to you later you can't00:29:20.760 blame anybody we had we had hotels we00:29:22.880 had Hotel kid out so you we went like00:29:25.279 this and then when the pandemic was over00:29:28.640 we accelerated through the roof we came00:29:30.080 up we gave free Consulting during the00:29:32.480 pandemic because I wanted to keep the00:29:34.240 people um it took a hit on balance00:29:36.600 sheets and so on but it meant that we00:29:38.559 were saying to our customers we'll give00:29:40.080 you free strategy free advice bit of00:29:41.799 technical support but remember us after00:29:43.480 the fact and and that's you know it came00:29:45.880 back with a vengeance so even when I had00:29:47.960 a a weak balance sheet on one agency the00:29:50.399 book of business came back with a00:29:51.480 flourish and it sold that on the up as00:29:53.159 well and that's another thing about00:29:54.799 selling is is the timing of of those00:29:56.840 sales but but00:29:59.000 um during the pandemic I put out a note00:30:01.720 on social media on LinkedIn and Twitter00:30:03.519 and so on to say in the spirit of00:30:06.039 everyone trying to help everybody uh and00:30:08.760 I had free time H I'm I'm willing to00:30:11.159 offer free half hour Zoom calls to00:30:14.200 anyone with a with a challenge or00:30:15.720 problem or to to fellow CEOs or00:30:18.320 entrepreneurs who would just wanted to00:30:19.600 talk I said the Only Rule was you're not00:30:21.799 LED sell to me I'm not alled to sell to00:30:23.320 you it's just a well met occasion where00:30:24.880 you can you can cry you can talk you you00:30:26.799 can do whatever and that was was00:30:28.880 fascinating to me I learned more about00:30:30.640 just you know I had CEOs on there who00:30:33.240 had you know a thousand people and00:30:35.720 suddenly they're literally told okay you00:30:37.799 you now need 20 people just to wind down00:30:40.279 the system to let everybody go and they00:30:42.519 find it hard looking in the mirror you00:30:43.880 know things of that I other on where you00:30:45.519 had a a 19-year-old saying I've got this00:30:47.720 great idea for Tech how do I engage the00:30:49.480 world and it's such a big answer you're00:30:52.600 like trying to break it down into00:30:53.919 meaningful chunks in an hour period of00:30:55.799 time to say well consider this first00:30:58.200 considered a second considered a third00:31:00.799 and the resistance to say go and get00:31:02.840 formal education before you try it00:31:04.519 because a lot of entrepreneurs don't00:31:05.960 want to do that they just want to get00:31:08.159 going um but then when I when I got more00:31:11.480 involved and I was kind of formerly00:31:13.559 chairman of a couple of these and it's00:31:15.120 easier to be an investment than a an00:31:16.760 investor than a chairman um I remember00:31:19.799 another instance a brilliant piece of00:31:21.200 tech too early to Market with a00:31:23.720 horrendous investor involved and the the00:31:28.120 damage I remember just trying to protect00:31:30.480 the startup team from that investor and00:31:33.120 he was taking finders fees for finding00:31:35.000 the money he was taking board seats all00:31:37.320 this kind of stuff he shall remain00:31:38.440 nameless but I remember this person00:31:41.360 would just in every board meeting just00:31:42.600 go on the attack because the CEO was00:31:44.600 young the COO were young they were the00:31:46.760 startup guys they were the the clever00:31:49.039 ones and this guy just no we need a00:31:52.039 50-year-old running that business you're00:31:53.840 terrible you're terrible and just attack00:31:55.440 attack attack and I would just spend the00:31:58.279 board meetings defending that person and00:32:00.919 and uh trying to find some kind of00:32:03.120 resonance be between people so again00:32:05.880 another weak point for a startup that00:32:07.279 you can't predict until you have the00:32:08.559 money and you're in flow and you don't00:32:10.880 expect it to be an internal problem you00:32:12.760 expect it to be the world connecting to00:32:14.600 the world is going to be the problem for00:32:15.919 the startups but it's a people game00:32:19.720 ultimately beay you to one of the00:32:21.440 property portals here in the UAE um I00:32:24.159 know the founders of that company and00:32:25.600 the parent company behind that wonderful00:32:27.559 human beings they have worked their ass00:32:31.159 off and I remember how long it took them00:32:33.639 to raise capital in the beginning now00:32:35.799 they're in a unicorn so they' done very00:32:37.399 well for themselves but I know the pain00:32:40.279 and I said to them you know what was it00:32:42.080 like at first and they went we were00:32:44.480 going to these these fundraising00:32:46.480 networking events and we went to a 10000:32:50.200 and we didn't know how to pitch MH we00:32:53.799 didn't know how to present we didn't00:32:55.639 really know what we were talking about00:32:57.720 and and it was after 100 events around00:33:01.559 that number that someone contacted them00:33:04.679 that had been at one of those events a00:33:06.080 few months earlier and that's where they00:33:08.480 got their first fund raise from they00:33:10.200 bootstrapped until then and I'm like did00:33:13.720 you just not know what you were doing00:33:15.240 they're like we didn't have a clue00:33:16.399 Spence we like genuinely didn't have a00:33:18.159 clue one of them one was at MIT the one00:33:21.120 was at Ox one was at cambrid super well00:33:22.760 educated people so you know all00:33:25.120 self-funded one was a finance guy one00:33:27.320 was a tech guy the other one was you00:33:28.840 know a marketing guy so and they're00:33:31.559 three brothers and so the trust was00:33:33.519 there and they're complimenting each00:33:34.799 other in terms of the skill sets was00:33:36.559 there um but none of them know what they00:33:38.919 were doing they look back on that now00:33:41.679 and they they're like it was just00:33:43.360 bloody-minded persistence that00:33:45.279 eventually got us there and I'm like had00:33:47.360 you known how to sell your concept sell00:33:49.960 your idea had you known how to genuinely00:33:52.559 build relationships and network with00:33:54.399 people what would be different they're00:33:56.679 like it would have been like is00:33:58.279 different yeah how often do you see00:34:01.000 entrepreneurs come to you that actually00:34:04.399 do have a good idea do have a good00:34:07.159 business they've started but just don't00:34:08.918 know how to verbalize it create a deck00:34:12.800 present it deliver it be passionate sell00:34:15.639 it essentially so that they can raise00:34:17.399 capital is that very frequent for you00:34:19.359 very frequent00:34:21.399 um the the very nature of what we've00:34:23.839 built in continuous Ventures now is00:34:25.760 we've got what's called A disruption un00:34:27.719 elligence team and that's all of these00:34:29.918 senior people that I used to make00:34:31.320 available every other Thursday in my my00:34:33.320 old instance of of companies we now have00:34:36.280 those people working full-time to00:34:38.159 support our Investment Portfolio and our00:34:40.119 startups and one of the big parts of00:34:42.879 their job is to reinforce any of the00:34:44.719 weak points that they see with anybody00:34:47.239 so you'll get superb technologists who00:34:50.520 like I say couldn't talk to a pretty00:34:52.000 girl or marketing person who can't00:34:54.119 explain a balance sheet or you know00:34:56.399 somebody who who won't understand why a00:34:58.920 particular color might be offensive in a00:35:00.440 certain territory if they're trying to00:35:01.680 sell it or things like that and you just00:35:03.839 never know where the weak points are so00:35:05.280 our team wrap themselves around those00:35:07.960 entrepreneurs to kind of make them as as00:35:11.440 copper fastened as possible on the00:35:13.040 journey so we see that every single day00:35:15.800 but it's not about oh that's not going00:35:18.240 to work because you're not the right guy00:35:19.760 to see this through I mean we've00:35:21.800 recalibrated firms in the past where the00:35:25.280 CEO is clearly not going to be you know00:35:27.240 you you get start of two two people one00:35:29.160 of them is the CEO right and you're like00:35:30.680 soly they're like LinkedIn I'm a CEO and00:35:32.440 director and it goes straight to their00:35:34.079 head and you're just like okay well what00:35:36.200 what oh you know we we um we do social00:35:38.920 media posts for a living you know that's00:35:40.760 that's our business but you look at them00:35:42.480 see look Le let's be frank you're not a00:35:45.079 CEO material but you're a brilliant00:35:46.880 Chief Innovation officer or you're great00:35:48.560 you're an ideas man or I mean we took00:35:50.760 one firm uh a couple years ago and we we00:35:53.240 recalibrated an an eight-year startup00:35:56.599 that had a patent and had a CEO who was00:35:59.240 tired and and a little begrudging that00:36:01.640 it hadn't gone better for him and we00:36:03.839 recalibrated moved him00:36:05.920 from Ireland where he was trying to00:36:08.359 Target um he was trying to Target the UK00:36:11.560 so we moved him into the region he was00:36:13.160 trying to Target registered a fresh00:36:15.040 company moved the patent and then re00:36:18.119 repositioned him as a Dyson type00:36:20.240 character he was like this is a new00:36:21.800 green startup with a full-time inventor00:36:24.960 then the interest came and that was00:36:28.160 pretty much the price of registering a00:36:29.680 firm and a little bit of message but how00:36:32.480 it was perceived by the market was where00:36:34.720 the secret sauce starts coming in00:36:36.160 suddenly you've got you know the same00:36:38.240 story told differently but now there's00:36:40.560 an appetite for it and it it kind of00:36:42.800 comes down you know the they say with00:36:44.560 the startups you know whether whether00:36:46.319 it's um luck or perseverance or after 1000:36:50.200 years in overnight success or any of00:36:52.040 this but you often hear this thing of00:36:54.079 fake it till you make it I don't believe00:36:56.280 in that for a second00:36:58.200 because faking it till you make it seems00:37:00.720 like Chancery seems like you're you're00:37:02.720 pretending you're worthwhile and then00:37:04.240 suddenly it might happen for you I from00:37:06.880 you believe in Project it then grow into00:37:09.359 that projection then project again grow00:37:11.160 into that projection again because it's00:37:12.839 driving yourself it's putting a future00:37:15.240 path there it's assuming success and00:37:18.000 it's not apologetic there's no imposter00:37:19.960 syndrome there's not anything that like00:37:22.079 oh thank God we got that deal or thank00:37:23.839 God they believed in us enough to sign a00:37:26.000 contract you're just saying I'm headed00:37:27.839 there who's with me it's a much more00:37:30.000 powerful message and then that means00:37:32.480 that you in in a technology firm or in a00:37:35.480 logistics firm or a data firm you're00:37:37.599 still putting people first the00:37:39.079 connection with the customer and your00:37:41.040 connection with the staff and and00:37:42.400 marrying those two things and uh you I00:37:45.920 think that's where the secret sauce in00:37:47.400 any of these startups00:37:49.520 lies interesting00:37:53.520 okay first of I'm going to ask this00:37:55.560 question because I know there's going to00:37:56.640 be a really great answer to this but00:37:58.960 before I ask the question let's give00:38:00.200 some context here you're you're a big00:38:02.000 fan of iido yes how long have you been00:38:04.400 doing Aikido for I started Aikido00:38:06.960 shortly after starting Continuum so00:38:08.800 would have been about 2003 okay I had00:38:11.040 done different martial arts but I had00:38:12.400 also been injured so I I took a break00:38:14.960 and then I took it up full-time in 200300:38:18.200 what is00:38:20.000 iido uh what is aido so it's a Japanese00:38:22.760 martial arts form but it's it's um while00:38:26.599 it's full Conta00:38:27.960 it's designed to be a peaceful martial00:38:30.800 art so understanding the physics of the00:38:33.520 body the philosophy of movement the00:38:35.800 philosophy of solving Conflict by00:38:37.720 blending with conflict centrifugal kind00:38:40.480 of movements and so on it's it's really00:38:43.040 designed to be a living breathing00:38:45.000 martial art as opposed to clashing with00:38:46.800 something so what I'd have is you know00:38:50.200 um historically I did Ninjutsu I did00:38:52.920 Karate I did aido with Ninjutsu if00:38:55.839 someone tried to hit you over the head00:38:56.880 with an iron bar00:38:58.280 you they teach how to dislocate the arm00:39:00.280 right pretty violent pretty aggressive00:39:02.520 in Kempo they'd say here this is how you00:39:04.760 snap a block and you might hurt your arm00:39:06.960 but at least it's not your head in iido00:39:09.440 they say firstly as a guyy swinging down00:39:11.400 a bar at you don't be00:39:14.319 there and secondly see he's got he's00:39:16.680 gone to all this effort and all this00:39:18.319 energy to attack you why not manipulate00:39:21.160 that and redistribute it into the00:39:22.640 universe and get on with your life you00:39:24.520 know and when I say don't be there the B00:39:26.680 the best marshal is to not physically be00:39:28.800 there to recognize the signs that's00:39:31.040 Brewing over there so girlfriend let's00:39:33.440 go we walk out the door but if an attack00:39:36.480 comes to understand the physics of that00:39:38.920 motion and the little telltale signs you00:39:41.440 see in people to understand the00:39:43.640 aggression to understand the movement00:39:45.079 and then blend with it you know the best00:39:47.319 way to kill an enemy as sunu we were00:39:49.520 joking about sunsu earlier is to make00:39:51.480 them your friend it's the biggest way to00:39:52.920 evaporate an enemy so if you blend with00:39:55.079 an attack the attack disappears and00:39:57.560 that's kind of the philosophy behind the00:40:00.200 the physicality of iido and I think the00:40:03.280 this it was one of those things where as00:40:06.280 I got to know it and I got to practice00:40:08.200 it it just suited my mindset and it felt00:40:11.119 like it was kind of a a missing spine in00:40:13.760 the Journey of my life it kind of00:40:15.359 connected some significant points in my00:40:17.560 life and it just made sense it was about00:40:20.240 blending with things instead of classing00:40:21.920 with things it changed your tone of00:40:23.760 voice it changed how you if you took it00:40:25.760 in you know if it really meant something00:40:27.400 to you the kind of underlying concept of00:40:30.800 Bushido is life in every breath and how00:40:34.520 that translated for me into into life00:40:36.960 and then into business was be deliberate00:40:40.280 we're having a conversation I'm looking00:40:41.800 not looking at my phone we're having cup00:40:43.920 of tea we're enjoying the tea if we're00:40:45.560 doing Japanese archery look at the focus00:40:48.000 that they have in that it was just about00:40:49.880 being deliberate in the moment and being00:40:52.160 free to to really really appreciate that00:40:54.319 moment and it's something I've00:40:55.359 definitely applied to life it's00:40:56.520 something I've definitely applied to00:40:57.720 work and even the guys in continuous00:40:59.839 ventes would slag me that's you know I'm00:41:01.640 overusing the word deliberate but you00:41:04.040 know even the work is like is what we're00:41:05.760 doing on purpose can it be challenged00:41:08.160 can it be defended and these are00:41:09.800 questions the startups need to hear as00:41:11.240 well as well as being a human going00:41:13.640 through this process every single part00:41:16.240 of our business process has to be00:41:17.960 measured kpi defended qualified so then00:41:21.000 it moves through to different phases but00:41:23.160 certainly for my own life it made it00:41:26.920 made a lot of sense and probably solved00:41:29.560 things in me you know um that I was00:41:32.040 struggling with fear and and you know a00:41:34.640 history of being bullied and all these00:41:36.319 things that you can choose to set down00:41:38.880 over time if you if you address it00:41:41.880 correctly you know you you talk about00:41:44.280 being bullied but you're sitting here00:41:45.800 opposite me and we're worried about the00:41:47.839 legs being too tall on the chair because00:41:49.560 you're you're you're you're you're a00:41:51.000 giant of a man you're you know did that00:41:54.480 that kind of and and and I'm sure when00:41:56.160 you were younger you you were probably00:41:58.200 tall and skinny as opposed to being tall00:42:00.800 and Broad yeah I was I was a clumsy00:42:02.920 puppy big feet B hands so so how old00:42:07.319 were you when you started kind of like00:42:08.720 to fill out and start to become this the00:42:10.880 strapping kind of guy you are now well00:42:13.160 thank you for noticing00:42:14.800 uh I was is that a chat upline or00:42:17.400 something yeah did you get with that00:42:19.720 recorded um I was probably I was being00:42:23.160 extremely badly badly bullied um I had00:42:26.359 an older brother who was who was uh00:42:28.359 rather rather intense and wired wrong um00:42:31.760 so I was being bullied at at home when00:42:33.760 my parents were there my parents were00:42:35.520 amazing um both work fulltime to put us00:42:37.880 into private school so they were often00:42:39.640 not there H and uh my brother was was a00:42:42.880 tough not and in the spirit of healing00:42:44.680 through understanding I think he was00:42:45.960 bullied by his friends or certainly the00:42:47.680 weak one in his group so he used to take00:42:49.680 it out of me um but it just meant then00:42:52.480 that I was going to school feeling you00:42:54.839 know vulnerable and I used to have to go00:42:57.200 go through City Center in Dublin in a00:42:59.079 private school uniform through the the00:43:01.960 the kind of working class areas from the00:43:03.520 from the railway stations and so on with00:43:05.760 like a tin Whistler recorder sticking00:43:07.319 out of side and so it was fair game00:43:09.319 right to the neighborhood and then I get00:43:11.359 into class and you know you'd kind of00:43:13.240 put your cat and you go back to your00:43:14.559 desk and your bag is in the bin or00:43:16.400 there's chocolate over your it was just00:43:18.160 this00:43:19.319 ongoing you know mood I remember saying00:43:22.400 to my parents I really wanted to move00:43:23.680 school and when they drilled into it I00:43:25.599 couldn't admit I was being bullied I00:43:26.960 just just was trying to say because I00:43:29.559 just want to move schools I want to move00:43:30.800 schools I'm delighted I didn't and my00:43:32.200 parents were amazing about it I just00:43:34.559 never told them and then years later I00:43:37.920 was working on a book in Africa in 200800:43:41.319 I think and I gave them the first draft00:43:43.440 and it was the first time I told him00:43:44.359 about what I'd been through and so on00:43:46.960 and uh I remember my dad God West was00:43:49.960 was really shocked had no idea you know00:43:53.200 and uh but so it culminated I got00:43:55.760 attacked one day my brother started00:43:57.440 smoking and he arranged for a guy to00:43:58.920 Ambush me with a knife pinned me against00:44:00.680 the wall I was like 13 and I froze00:44:03.480 completely froze and uh it's funny I can00:44:06.800 still remember now but I remember it was00:44:09.079 the freezing worried me more than00:44:10.559 anything else uh if the guy punched me00:44:13.200 or something that would have been00:44:14.240 probably easier uh I was playing rugby00:44:16.839 for school and so on so I was I I was00:44:19.359 tall so I couldn't not do rugby but I00:44:21.760 was uh when when something comes out of00:44:23.559 the universe and attacks you you can't00:44:25.079 rationalize that and it sat would me00:44:26.640 very bad00:44:28.400 um and they long story short about six00:44:29.800 months later of of worrying about that I00:44:32.200 I I stopped at a martial arts center on00:44:33.839 a Saturday and it was just these mixed00:44:36.640 various martial arts who' obviously00:44:38.000 taken a lease together and I I went in00:44:39.720 and it was Ninjutsu which is a very00:44:41.640 impressive gymnastic martial arts they00:44:44.040 were black they look cool it was like00:44:45.520 something out of the movies but I was00:44:47.280 still this nervous kid you know clumsy00:44:50.559 and and and and timid but I spoke to the00:44:54.680 the trainer afterwards and I I just went00:44:56.319 up and said look I don't want to do this00:44:57.359 or anything but can I just tell you I00:44:59.440 told him about what happened and I said00:45:01.079 can I how do you not freeze was the00:45:03.880 question basically I was kind of00:45:05.319 struggling to to get out and he just00:45:07.520 said look this people talk about fight00:45:09.599 and flight but it's actually fight00:45:11.000 flight and freeze and he said the the00:45:13.200 challenge is you'll always have the00:45:14.440 reaction you'll always be a freezer but00:45:16.480 you can learn to be switched on by it00:45:18.280 rather than switched off so the moment00:45:19.720 it happens you go you you move rather00:45:22.200 than freeze doesn't mean you haven't00:45:23.680 Frozen but you recognize the symptoms00:45:25.200 and off you go and I I I then went down00:45:29.119 the route of you know Ninjutsu and and00:45:31.720 Kempo and literally tournaments fighting00:45:33.760 and all this kind of stuff so built a00:45:36.200 pair of shoulders built a pair of arms00:45:38.160 had to run with my brother one time it00:45:39.680 was the last time he ever had to run00:45:41.000 with00:45:41.960 me and uh kind of built it out from00:45:44.319 there but I got that out of my system00:45:46.359 but very interestingly I became the kind00:45:48.040 of the anti-bully then if I saw kids00:45:49.839 getting bullied I'd step forward and you00:45:54.160 know it and it really helped me with00:45:55.880 with with work over over the years00:45:58.440 because I then start to antagonize00:46:00.720 because if things got violent I was kind00:46:03.040 of comfortable with that you know you're00:46:04.160 16 you're cocky then you have a chest00:46:05.760 and you feel like you're bulletproof but00:46:08.240 um you'd antagonize and then you'd look00:46:10.480 for the little nonverbal signs or the00:46:12.640 reactions and things like that you know00:46:14.200 you you'd see a guy going hell would you00:46:16.640 but he'd look around three people around00:46:18.400 him looking to be egged on or something00:46:20.559 and I found that piece absolutely00:46:22.280 fascinating the non-verbal piece and00:46:25.400 that's been a huge influence in in my00:46:27.559 life I even like when I watch the news I00:46:29.400 turn this the sound off and I just watch00:46:32.040 the politicians because they usually you00:46:34.400 know in a in a pressurized live00:46:36.440 environment trying to you know peacock00:46:38.440 or whatever they're doing and I just00:46:40.319 kept on watching for non-verbal cues00:46:42.720 which helped with martial arts because I00:46:45.319 you know I burnt out of the feir wasn't00:46:47.440 afraid of anything anymore so I can00:46:48.960 stand on the stage of 10,000 people now00:46:50.720 and you know not say boo it it doesn't00:46:53.480 bother me at all I played music any of00:46:55.680 these things I just in my write this now00:46:58.720 and again it was in the moment that kind00:47:00.960 of mindfulness not bringing anything00:47:03.359 else into it except for what I needed00:47:05.720 there and then you know I used to think00:47:07.520 of it like you know Newton's cradles00:47:09.359 those balls that go I used to in my mind00:47:12.480 I used to imagine I could just decide00:47:14.240 and they they'd just stop and start00:47:16.040 swinging together instead of clacking00:47:17.559 against each other and and that was I I00:47:19.599 I learn learned a phrase much later on00:47:21.800 called equipoise and it was just about00:47:24.359 that kind of centeredness and Stillness00:47:26.319 and so on it sounds a bit cliche but00:47:28.880 when you just decide okay this now and00:47:31.800 nothing else it comes to you that that00:47:35.040 that confidence and that that calmness00:47:37.079 and uh aido and Bushido that kind of00:47:39.839 philosophy just just sat with that well00:47:42.000 you know so that's kept me to this00:47:46.760 day for me it's trying00:47:49.400 to to00:47:51.599 take somebody who's been through an00:47:54.160 experience is taking on a martial art00:47:56.599 that's toughened him up he's then moved00:47:59.000 to another00:48:00.720 form and and then that form which seems00:48:03.880 like a a more as you as you describe a00:48:07.040 calmer um more thoughtful more flow00:48:09.640 inducing form00:48:12.119 and I can see how taken on the martial00:48:14.920 art at the beginning there potentially00:48:17.000 solved a problem and it was like I the00:48:20.559 freezing thing that I want to go there00:48:22.359 if that man can help me not freeze then00:48:24.520 that's that's the problem I'm trying to00:48:25.839 solve when when you look at businesses00:48:28.240 that you've built and you sold and ones00:48:29.520 that you've been involved with as well00:48:31.319 when you take on akido and its00:48:33.559 principles you talk about as you just00:48:35.760 said earlier deliberate okay so that's00:48:37.520 clearly something that's ingrained in00:48:39.280 you within within that that that that uh00:48:42.000 process that you00:48:44.520 apply do you find yourself watching00:48:48.119 People's lack of because you're so00:48:51.760 strong in your knowledge around does it00:48:54.160 do you understand what I mean that I do00:48:56.079 I do because to me it's kind of like00:48:57.799 that it's it's who you are so that that00:49:01.559 would make it almost like you could00:49:03.000 notice it so apparently to you when00:49:05.160 people and does it make you go okay he00:49:07.160 doesn't know this kind of stuff or does00:49:08.319 it make you go for goodness sake you00:49:10.880 donut yeah there's a bit of there's a00:49:13.079 bit of is that there's a bit of that I00:49:15.200 mean uh we had planned I hope he's not00:49:17.160 been with me yeah no no no no you're00:49:20.200 you're you're safe enough we're in a00:49:21.559 safe place safe place we had planned a00:49:24.559 Trilogy of books when I was working with00:49:26.240 an old friend friend of mine who's who's00:49:27.359 very sick now we can't we can't proceed00:49:28.920 with it but but we had decided on on on00:49:31.799 writing three books and the first one00:49:33.960 was called the tribe of one and it was00:49:35.359 about looking at because we're not00:49:37.079 qualified it was only philos philosophy00:49:39.280 it wasn't we're not qualified to go any00:49:41.160 deeper on it but we were just we did00:49:42.920 some work in Africa together we did some00:49:44.240 work in London together and we're just00:49:45.599 looking at people and watching people00:49:47.319 and you know you you'd watch you know00:49:50.240 Canary Warf at quarter 8 in the morning00:49:53.400 and you just see people running up a00:49:55.440 moving escalator and you know on their00:49:58.200 phone earphones and you just kind of00:50:00.520 wondering about how people see their own00:50:02.920 life and how they navigate through a day00:50:04.720 right and and what they don't do and00:50:06.599 what they don't stop to take in and I00:50:08.640 don't mean you know stare at the trees00:50:10.400 and and Forest bath or any of this stuff00:50:12.359 which is all amazing stuff but actually00:50:14.559 just are they given themselves a moment00:50:17.280 I mean one of the things I've enjoyed00:50:19.839 particularly after an exit is you have00:50:21.760 time in your day to think about your day00:50:24.160 not to think about what you have to get00:50:25.440 done you know I'm not you're a great00:50:27.960 early riser I mean you're you written00:50:30.359 the book on it by the time I see your00:50:32.440 Instagram post five hours has passed I'm00:50:34.559 like oh he's he's back from the desert00:50:36.040 already but you know I I'm I'm00:50:38.799 not but there's moments in my day00:50:40.960 there's waves in my day like I would00:50:42.240 only do email twice a week um I would00:50:45.480 only you know there's certain things I00:50:46.880 don't allow say that again because I00:50:48.599 don't think people would have picked00:50:49.680 that up you do emails twice a week yeah00:50:51.799 so I would have typically about two two00:50:54.640 hour Windows a week to do email00:50:57.680 I and that is the only time you would00:50:59.280 respond and Zend00:51:01.119 y consciously consciously deliberately00:51:04.079 like you if you email me you'll get an00:51:05.880 out of office saying you00:51:08.720 know in small Windows of time I'll be00:51:10.920 able to answer you but if here's an00:51:12.280 escalation process if it's something00:51:13.760 bigger I have an amazing assistant00:51:15.760 Sunshine hello but um it's it's just00:51:20.160 that's if I'm sitting at a desk I'm not00:51:21.599 doing my job really not and so you don't00:51:26.079 get moment00:51:27.520 you don't build energy you don't build00:51:29.280 teams you don't build resonance between00:51:31.040 teams by sending emails and so on in00:51:33.839 fact emails are usually after the fact00:51:35.480 when you're trying to catch things or00:51:37.160 blame things you know um when I was00:51:39.640 interviewing for the the dni team and00:51:42.040 and my partner column in continuous I00:51:45.079 was looking for extreme talent because00:51:47.200 we knew we we wanted to build a00:51:48.520 worldclass team and we knew they were00:51:50.200 all very very experienced people to00:51:52.720 people that I hoped I'd I'd struggle to00:51:54.799 interview because they were so good00:51:57.119 and and that's what I wanted I wanted to00:51:59.160 be the dumbest guy in that room as I00:52:00.680 said but I wasn't just looking at them00:52:03.000 from their extreme skill set are their00:52:05.280 extreme experience or perspective on the00:52:07.400 world I was looking at them seeing how00:52:09.160 would they resonate with another extreme00:52:11.720 person in another part of what we call00:52:14.040 the different lenses how we look at all00:52:16.319 of our deal flow all of these lenses00:52:18.720 design creativity data science quants00:52:20.839 everything they all look at anything we00:52:22.200 bring to the table and and bring if we00:52:25.200 if we commit to investing we bring bring00:52:26.680 that entrepreneur on the journey so it's00:52:29.000 how these people resonate with00:52:30.920 others and yeah you can sort of go right00:52:34.640 you look around and think oh I've got an00:52:35.920 advantage of you I've got an advantage00:52:37.000 of you but that's only if you're letting00:52:38.920 your ego trigger like you see those00:52:41.640 those little videos on on YouTube where00:52:43.960 you where the shark swins and all the00:52:45.400 fish avoid it all the time that's the00:52:47.520 that effect you'll end up being alone00:52:49.160 right you'll be of the Walk but you00:52:50.839 end up being alone because you're making00:52:52.760 it about you when you remove that and00:52:55.359 you make it about other people00:52:57.520 then things start to change and to me00:53:00.359 the most successful entrepreneurs that I00:53:02.000 see both the ones that are billionaires00:53:04.319 and the ones that are just starting off00:53:07.079 they're cam they're able to be00:53:09.200 comfortable around anybody they00:53:11.040 literally have that ability to what I00:53:13.119 call a network chameleon they they can00:53:14.680 kind of adapt and helps when you're00:53:16.440 talking about pitching and so on if I'm00:53:19.040 telling you about me I'm kind of failing00:53:21.240 the message here MH and it's that all00:53:23.200 that just people hate being sold to but00:53:25.280 they love buying you love to go in and00:53:27.319 say right there's a brand new car it's00:53:28.520 mine but you don't want the Slick guy00:53:30.000 going oh you'd look right in this sir00:53:31.839 you know saying you're allergic to that00:53:33.119 you go go away from me and but the more00:53:36.480 you blend with people the more you can00:53:37.680 adapt people and this is your language00:53:39.240 your framework um you I know you've00:53:41.760 you've talked to Chris Voss before he's00:53:43.480 a master in talking about mirroring and00:53:45.760 and making the conversation turning00:53:47.319 their own sentence on them again and00:53:49.720 again all of these tips and tricks help00:53:52.079 how you relate to people and then I'd00:53:54.559 always say there's two types of people00:53:55.920 in the world there drains and there00:53:57.400 radiators people who are exuding energy00:54:00.079 and other people who are just the room00:54:01.680 is empty with them in it and I don't do00:54:03.920 very well around00:54:06.200 drains that's fantastic okay um you00:54:09.599 recently moved to Dubai yes you've been00:54:11.640 here I think a few months now 108 days00:54:14.640 and you you came across a island and and00:54:17.280 and and you told me when we had the00:54:18.760 dinner that evening that you had sold00:54:21.720 everything moved here and bought nothing00:54:24.640 yep which seemed a little bit weird now00:54:27.760 I would I would I would suggest bought00:54:29.920 nothing whilst you're deciding what to00:54:31.720 buy maybe there there's a there's a00:54:33.520 reason for not but the Liberation that00:54:36.720 seemed to be in your eyes when you were00:54:38.599 explaining this to me at the time so can00:54:40.520 you just share that with me again and00:54:42.160 why did you do that and how does that00:54:43.599 feel well it it feels fantastic I mean00:54:46.960 you know firstly it was a nice exercise00:54:50.040 in in detaching from things so you you00:54:52.760 you you know has his cars and so on uh00:54:56.160 it it's nice to just shake all that off00:54:58.839 not even just from an operational point00:55:00.319 of view you know um but just from a a00:55:04.160 detached of of of feelings00:55:07.839 the sharing things with people is very00:55:10.200 very important and going through things00:55:12.440 with people are very important but like00:55:14.359 the last time I went back to duin I00:55:16.760 visited my my house which is now sold as00:55:20.160 well and uh it didn't feel like a home00:55:23.200 anymore and it was a very clear thing00:55:25.319 and it just reminded me that that was00:55:26.839 just stuff I actually pride myself on00:55:29.160 the stuff that I don't need I don't even00:55:30.720 have a car here or anything and uh it's00:55:33.599 just about my family now that will00:55:35.960 change over time because you know Dubai00:55:38.559 is lovely and there's lovely places to00:55:40.079 live and and and uh my kids want things00:55:42.799 and so on but as it stands currently00:55:45.240 granted I own Investments and companies00:55:47.280 and so on but that's all you know in a00:55:49.400 portfolio somewhere other than that I'm00:55:51.599 completely free and it's great and it00:55:54.039 just it just resets you and it reminds00:55:55.720 you that00:55:57.319 the people that are traveling with you00:55:58.680 and the moments you're going through are00:56:00.319 so much more important than stuff and00:56:02.440 stuff depreciates but people and00:56:04.680 relationships hopefully appreciate and00:56:07.359 just drives that point home to you the00:56:09.119 guy that's the founder of telegram Pavo00:56:11.680 I for what his surname he F he famously00:56:14.000 said in an interview he said I own00:56:15.319 nothing he said why would you want to00:56:17.240 own stuff like that it gets in the way00:56:19.000 of your freedom to be yeah I mean you00:56:21.799 you you made me struggle Z tell me to00:56:23.520 wear not a black T-shirt I literally00:56:25.400 just wear a black T-shirt every day I'm00:56:28.079 like this morning like what will I00:56:30.880 wear that was my biggest challenge you00:56:33.160 know00:56:34.000 yeah you've won some awards yeah when00:56:37.599 you win awards for the work that you do00:56:39.240 and I'll just I'll just make sure that00:56:40.559 we share these here with with amazing00:56:42.640 talented people not just yeah with00:56:44.599 amazing talented people when we talk00:56:46.000 about the awards so we've got the award00:56:47.280 that you won the pr Global person award00:56:49.559 okay and on top of that you won an award00:56:53.640 um a continuing award for transformation00:56:57.160 that that award what was it called uh00:56:59.000 the the golden spider award the grand00:57:01.680 Grand Prix award golden spider so you00:57:03.440 win you win these award00:57:05.240 and how does it feel to win00:57:09.000 Awards uh I think it's because you went00:57:11.599 to Career recently yes I did yeah South00:57:13.839 Korea yeah three weeks ago that was we00:57:17.319 could do a whole podcast on that00:57:19.039 experience yeah and that was L you that00:57:21.319 was that was we we were in the National00:57:23.799 Assembly and was presented an award00:57:26.760 um for our kind of ethical Investments00:57:29.240 our ESG Investments for continuous00:57:30.960 investment continuous Ventures and uh so00:57:34.200 a lot of environmental stuff a lot of00:57:35.520 Medtech stuff Urban Tech things like00:57:37.160 that as well and we're moving very fast00:57:39.240 but that was very touching the welcome00:57:41.039 we got was very touching uh myself and00:57:43.039 the team were were all uh greatly00:57:45.599 received and um one of our client00:57:47.559 Investments was also won an award and00:57:49.839 Paul he was amazing um yeah it was funny00:57:54.240 I it was funny for me because I was so00:57:56.200 so far from Ireland and Ireland's a00:57:58.720 small place but it seems to get00:58:00.119 connected everywhere and we met with the00:58:01.720 ambassador to Ireland there and you know00:58:04.400 I wore a green tie on purpose and things00:58:06.440 like that you know my dad would have00:58:07.960 been proud and it was it was a nice it00:58:10.839 was a really nice uh occasion um when00:58:14.799 you when you win Awards I remember my00:58:17.319 first award was in 2003 I won best new00:58:19.839 internet ENT entrepreneur in Ireland H00:58:22.480 it was called the net Visionary award00:58:25.160 and uh on the night my parents were with00:58:28.039 me and I remember they said and the00:58:30.000 winter is I was sitting there my my00:58:31.880 probably rented tuxedo at the time and I00:58:34.559 remember my my my um fingers crossed00:58:37.240 like this and my head down and it was00:58:38.760 they were going through you know the00:58:39.880 finalists and a little profile of them00:58:42.400 and the winner is and I remember getting00:58:44.000 hit by this kind of wave of loneliness00:58:46.520 like nobody was going through this with00:58:48.000 me this wasn't significant for anyone00:58:49.640 else except for me and I remember00:58:52.680 carrying that feeling up on the side one00:58:54.319 and I I remember carrying that feeling00:58:55.480 up on the stage just going who that that00:58:57.440 actually feels really00:58:58.680 empty but those spider awards for00:59:01.599 example they I give credit to them00:59:04.160 completely to the staff that I worked00:59:05.880 with the teams that I worked with00:59:07.160 because I remember one of our clients we00:59:09.160 won a huge um spider award for them for00:59:12.599 best e-commerce00:59:14.680 in uh in England or the United Kingdom I00:59:17.319 think and it was a big deal and their00:59:19.280 marketing director was with us and she00:59:21.039 had a review the next day so I said here00:59:22.880 just walk in and plunk that on the desk00:59:25.160 so for them it was great stamps in their00:59:26.920 CV uh I think when you're when you're00:59:29.400 building00:59:31.000 companies you you only kind of you never00:59:33.680 really stop to to smell the roses you're00:59:35.760 always looking about you forget about00:59:37.440 what you've done well and you just focus00:59:38.799 on what of the next challenges and00:59:40.119 there's always more challenges right and00:59:41.680 there's always more things to do but00:59:43.680 those things they they force you to look00:59:46.480 around look look your teammates in the00:59:48.319 eye and toasted glass champ Pages we00:59:49.960 bloody dter and you know we have a ways00:59:52.319 to go yet but it's it's there's nice00:59:54.359 recognition um and some of the I I kept00:59:56.720 some of them just nostalgically um here00:59:59.520 as I say of nothing but I could a couple01:00:01.760 of those are in the office here in Dubai01:00:03.319 now as well is there something when you01:00:05.720 go back and and it doesn't matter which01:00:07.599 part of your life because it could be01:00:09.119 childhood as well but is there something01:00:11.920 that you weren't recognized for that01:00:14.960 still to this day sits in your mind and01:00:17.400 you wish you01:00:19.319 were uh I definitely being very honest01:00:24.200 and personal I definitely struggled for01:00:26.119 having an older brother really care for01:00:28.000 me and I definitely noticed that it01:00:30.079 meant that I responded to older people01:00:32.039 better which I think became a strength01:00:34.280 over time but but back then you just01:00:36.720 wanted your older brother to you know01:00:38.160 rub your hair and say he loved you and01:00:39.440 so on and we never had that relationship01:00:41.400 unfortunately um and even I remember01:00:44.079 seeing in school reports it would say I01:00:47.400 didn't really care about my peer01:00:50.000 feedback I was looking for the teachers01:00:52.000 feedback or you know U supervisors or01:00:54.359 things like that and uh you know in01:00:56.880 whatever way we get a we become a01:00:59.000 patchwork quilt as as I me our kind of01:01:01.920 construct over time that was certainly01:01:04.119 something I was I was more comfortable01:01:05.720 and more interested in older people01:01:08.359 generally um and I I think it it kind of01:01:11.079 worked like at 21 I was presenting in01:01:12.760 the boardrooms of IBM in Dublin and01:01:15.240 purely because I could create PowerPoint01:01:16.720 it wasn't because of my great great01:01:18.240 strategic thoughts I could just make it01:01:19.680 look Do01:01:20.680 It um and but I learned a lot about01:01:23.240 politics I learned a lot about you know01:01:25.359 middle Mar management you know silos of01:01:28.880 power and protection and all that kind01:01:30.160 of stuff and and I really really fought01:01:31.760 to make sure there was no politics or01:01:33.280  in any company I was involved01:01:35.200 with or anything that I built and even01:01:37.640 now if you looked at our our dni team01:01:40.440 we've we've got three teams in continus01:01:42.039 with have a partners team the the01:01:43.319 disruption intelligence team and then01:01:44.799 what we call client Partners who are the01:01:46.880 main principles of anything we invest in01:01:49.520 but when you look at the dni team which01:01:51.000 is our kind of Secret Sauce that's a01:01:53.079 circular team where they're all facing01:01:54.279 each other and the process goes through01:01:56.000 the middle of them their our lenses on01:01:57.720 the world and their job is to be a01:02:00.200 rising tide to anything they touch and01:02:02.799 we get to include them we get to bring01:02:05.839 them along on our journey we we we can01:02:07.839 focus on making them wealthy over time01:02:09.680 because we can make them shareholders of01:02:11.319 the things we invest in if they're01:02:13.599 subject matter experts in those areas we01:02:15.440 can we've our internal share a scheme so01:02:18.039 they their job is to be good for society01:02:21.200 is to bring the next generation of01:02:23.279 business of of an ethical investment01:02:25.920 it's not all ethical Essence we're not01:02:27.839 Saints either it's not our mandate it01:02:29.799 just happens to really suit how we see01:02:32.279 the01:02:33.000 world but they're a very motivated01:02:35.119 talented team that um it's a privilege01:02:38.400 when you get to handpick everyone you01:02:39.640 work with so you you can't take that01:02:41.880 privilege for granted you have to really01:02:43.680 really focus on that and make it about01:02:45.599 them not make it about you so even in my01:02:48.480 last uh in my last instance as as01:02:52.240 CEO um I did this um murf business01:02:56.359 school leadership training thing and to01:02:58.160 do this psychometric testing very very01:03:00.400 intense prism psychometric testing and I01:03:03.599 just gave I gave it to all the senior01:03:05.640 team and I said There You Go warts and01:03:07.440 all very vulnerable thing to do but01:03:09.359 again you know I said the better you01:03:12.160 understand this the better you can use01:03:13.160 me as a business tool so that's if you01:03:16.160 see my eyes rolling in the back of my01:03:17.640 head it's because of that weed Point not01:03:19.079 because it's me you know but to them01:03:21.640 they got the point is just like okay01:03:22.880 this is a very Frank relationship we're01:03:24.359 having here and it's the one thing I01:03:25.839 insist on with the guys we work with is01:03:28.200 be very direct be very Frank don't coat01:03:30.799 sugarcoat things because if you get this01:03:33.000 decision wrong for us we're in a lovely01:03:35.720 environment it's it's a a privileged air01:03:38.160 and and we get to work with amazing01:03:39.599 talent and so on but for the01:03:41.760 entrepreneurs coming through the the01:03:43.440 place quite often private equity and01:03:45.520 Venture Capital they go you oh you want01:03:47.160 our a couple of million Kiss the Ring01:03:48.640 here and so on but if you think of the01:03:52.319 emotional Journey a lot of entrepreneurs01:03:54.039 go through this could be their one Moon01:03:55.960 they could have given up the day job01:03:57.359 spent their savings and they arrive01:03:59.279 exhausted at our door so we say they're01:04:02.400 our customer and and treat them with01:04:04.559 emotional intelligence it is it's a it's01:04:06.640 a human game but you you have to treat01:04:10.400 them with emotional intelligence even if01:04:12.039 you know you're dealing with somebody01:04:13.359 who's brilliant and heavily on the01:04:15.319 Spectrum and you look at them and01:04:16.960 they're lightning in a jar and they just01:04:19.119 can't express themselves to you you01:04:20.760 still have to make it about you to01:04:22.520 connect with them and I think that's a01:04:24.599 very worthy challenge particularly when01:04:26.680 you have all these different lenses that01:04:28.440 mean we need to connect to that person01:04:30.079 in different ways to make them01:04:32.079 potentially successful investing is a01:04:34.200 very very Risky Business particularly01:04:35.760 with startups so what we're doing is01:04:37.559 trying to drisk that by creating fully01:04:40.119 evolved CEOs through that journey and if01:04:42.839 not we reserve the right typically in01:04:45.359 our structures to bring them on the01:04:47.279 journey but if we say look we need to01:04:48.559 put a CEO above you and you focus on01:04:51.440 your strength your power and this person01:04:53.119 will be a commercial person they'll01:04:54.520 worry about the day today you just focus01:04:57.799 on your Brilliance and let's bring that01:04:59.240 out of you you're still making it about01:05:01.079 them it's still a a learning experience01:05:03.680 for them and uh you know as I would say01:05:06.680 we're building a a wall Garden of trees01:05:09.839 okay and some of those trees will bear01:05:11.079 fruit some won't they'll die in the vine01:05:13.200 others will grow roots for five years01:05:14.760 and then suddenly spring up you just01:05:16.200 never know what the the mix of trees is01:05:19.359 going to be and they all need nurturing01:05:20.720 they all need care in different ways um01:05:23.039 and it once you put those entrepreneurs01:05:25.039 at the center that process I think01:05:27.200 you're you're kind of drisking the01:05:31.400 journey I get this01:05:34.680 sense that there's something you're01:05:36.640 trying to01:05:38.760 prove to some I don't know what and but01:05:44.200 your brother keeps coming up in my mind01:05:46.520 and I don't know why yeah well I mean01:05:48.799 you we've talked about him today I think01:05:52.400 um I think uh it's it's probably fresh01:05:56.240 cuz he passed away last year um it was01:05:58.640 he was quite unwell but he had an01:06:00.680 accident before he broke 18 bones fell01:06:02.599 out of a tree and so on so I was01:06:03.960 involved in helping him in in his life01:06:05.760 and sponsoring some part of his life01:06:07.760 even though we didn't really have a01:06:08.960 connection but it was just a in my head01:06:12.440 it's not this big emotional Gap now it's01:06:15.319 just a shame it's just a bloody shame01:06:16.960 let have gone for pin or more but the01:06:18.920 fact of the matter was he'd ring me01:06:20.039 whenever he needed money or we'd have01:06:22.640 the same conversation every time you01:06:24.640 know seemed like a nice guy his friends01:06:27.400 in where he lived in Florida loved him I01:06:30.680 even met one girl who who claimed that01:06:32.400 she saved his life when she was 12 he01:06:33.960 stopped her from drowning so I'm like he01:06:36.079 seemed to have a great life there he01:06:37.640 just didn't have it with us he left when01:06:39.240 he was 19 never came back to Ireland01:06:41.440 never left America again never did email01:06:44.359 never had a smartphone he was just01:06:45.760 really removed did gardening for a01:06:48.119 living and uh I just hop that he was01:06:50.400 very very happy in that he just didn't01:06:52.440 seem to need the connections with us you01:06:54.160 know and it's just a01:06:56.359 it's it's uh there's that kind of thing01:06:59.319 of healing through understanding you01:07:00.559 sort of go okay I know what it was more01:07:02.880 importantly I understand what it wasn't01:07:04.240 and possibly some of the reasons for01:07:05.599 that it's just a Pity I think we would01:07:07.599 have had some fun together and uh I01:07:09.520 think he would have enjoyed the journey01:07:11.400 uh a little bit more you know but I01:07:13.200 think the same about my dad my dad01:07:14.520 passed away three years ago and01:07:17.960 sometimes now like I kind of you know01:07:20.039 and like yeah Dad I'm on stage in the01:07:21.720 assembly in ker getting an award for01:07:23.319 being a global person I'm a big deal in01:07:25.520 South career now and my dad would would01:07:27.520 have reveled in that you know he really01:07:29.079 did and so would my mom so uh yeah it's01:07:32.160 just about you know you look back but01:07:34.160 you don't stare is is kind of how I look01:07:36.359 at it and you you um you bring the01:07:39.319 people that you care about along in this01:07:41.000 journey and you're hopefully open and01:07:43.279 sensitive to them the language you use01:07:45.279 should be uh blending with people not01:07:48.240 conflicting with them and uh you know01:07:50.359 every day is a a learning experience01:07:52.400 with different people and and the01:07:54.799 privilege of this job is I meet so many01:07:56.880 diverse kind of people I mean01:07:59.000 even on our dni team I think there's01:08:01.240 about 24 languages on the team and I01:08:03.680 think that's a great symbol of of of01:08:05.760 success and and and I don't mean01:08:07.559 diversity for diversity's sake this01:08:09.319 isn't like quota building in in a01:08:11.599 America or something it's just like it01:08:13.680 takes a certain kind of person to leave01:08:16.000 where they lived and and they're01:08:17.560 comfortable or it's safe and their01:08:19.040 family may be there to go somewhere else01:08:21.279 to work their ass off and you know you01:08:24.279 see that in the Middle East and01:08:25.960 particularly in Dubai in in in to such01:08:28.679 an extreme that I get so excited by the01:08:31.198 people I've met and the people have01:08:32.399 hired and even I've often found recently01:08:35.439 you know there there's been some jobs we01:08:37.158 filled and I'm like oh I wish we had01:08:39.679 three slots because I I find it very01:08:41.960 hard to to pick from those three people01:08:43.520 I hate to walk away from talent but we01:08:45.920 also have we're building out an agency01:08:47.439 one of our investments and we'll have01:08:48.960 200 people there by Christmas of next01:08:50.560 year I'm like oh let's genuinely keep in01:08:53.399 touch because I'll have a thing for you01:08:55.479 just not yet or just not for this team01:08:57.238 you know um and that's great that's you01:08:59.880 know so am I trying to prove01:09:02.799 anything no I think I think one of the01:09:05.359 reasons I moved here was for a big01:09:06.880 worthy challenge I wasn't about to go01:09:08.600 into business again life was pretty01:09:10.319 comfortable and I I didn't you know I01:09:13.479 wanted a big Market with a meaningful01:09:15.560 purpose and a real a big big audacious01:09:19.080 Challenge and my God we have we got01:09:22.560 us last question before I finish sir01:09:31.600 who do you care that you want to make01:09:34.759 proud of you who do I care oh my kids01:09:39.679 definitely um you want to be uh01:09:43.120 shoulders for them you know you want01:09:44.479 have you know you want to01:09:47.279 uh you want to have gone through your01:09:49.399 struggles in a way that when they look01:09:51.560 at what you went through um they can see01:09:54.920 that the journey and you know I I often01:09:58.600 say you know my wife to my wife and I01:10:01.239 say look we've done well but the kids01:10:05.159 are broke and we want them to learn to01:10:07.159 smell blood on their own because that01:10:09.440 kind of strength and resilience is a01:10:11.080 gift you give yourself you earn it over01:10:13.000 time and I'd really want that for them01:10:16.400 um I it there's very little else01:10:18.840 important to me you know some very close01:10:21.040 friends a an interesting and momentum of01:10:24.159 life and and you know My Little Secret01:10:27.520 Garden of Love and and and kids and so01:10:29.480 on and and that's kind of it you know01:10:31.320 it's it's you know you talk about01:10:33.520 detaching from stuff earlier yeah I've01:10:36.600 been I've been at occasions where you're01:10:38.679 trying to be all things to all people01:10:40.040 particularly when you're bootstrapping a01:10:41.840 an agency in an at in Ireland you know01:10:44.199 you kind of you're you're trying to be01:10:45.960 everybody's best friend and you you01:10:47.679 become very protective of your energy01:10:49.440 because you don't have the funds to to01:10:51.960 go and build a big amazing teams like we01:10:54.000 do now and01:10:55.760 you share your energy with people01:10:58.120 because you have to bring them along01:10:59.880 with you on the01:11:01.120 journey like you're giving Junior people01:11:03.480 big titles because you can't afford the01:11:04.800 big person you're trying to bring them01:11:06.080 along and I find excuse me that my01:11:10.080 energy um there's kind of two things01:11:12.679 that that frustrate me instantly I have01:11:14.520 a slow fuse when it comes to temper but01:11:16.880 two things frustrate one is crazy01:11:18.440 drivers so you know uh01:11:22.560 Dubai pick the wrong place for that oh01:11:24.960 yeah I I sit in the back and I work and01:11:27.000 I just say let's go that way which suits01:11:29.040 me too it's it's you know but um and01:11:31.880 then simple things having to repeat01:11:34.080 myself uh like simple things that have01:11:36.560 one function they can't do it like if a01:11:38.120 toaster doesn't work you know clock the01:11:40.159 thing bread doesn't go down clock it01:11:41.600 again right goes o"
