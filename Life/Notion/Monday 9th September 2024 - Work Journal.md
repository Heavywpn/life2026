# Daily Summary

## Daily Summary

Today, I focused on managing tasks and addressing client emails. The outstanding balance with Himalay Consulting needs attention, and a strategy for addressing this in our next meeting is crucial. Ann's issue with the Teams notification suggests a possible technical glitch with IMR, which may require further investigation.

On the staff attendance side, Dean and Harry are both out sick, which has impacted our team's capacity. It's important to check in and ensure they have the support they need. Ethan is also not working today, so workload distribution may need adjusting. Kristyn's professionalism, as always, is appreciated, and her presence helps maintain morale.

## Staff notes

- Dean has called in sick. Him and Harry have a bug. Dean sent a message to Kristyn not me.
- Ethan is not working today
- Krisytn is very nicley dressed as normal
