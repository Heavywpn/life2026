Dr Michael Israetel  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/OTrTqs9FLq0](https://www.youtube.com/watch/OTrTqs9FLq0)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.160 doing this at home will give you  <br>00:00:01.880 phenomenal overall results with not so  <br>00:00:04.359 much time investment and it's not so  <br>00:00:06.080 difficult we're talking about a su total  <br>00:00:08.320 of really yeah yeah doing that per week  <br>00:00:11.360 will radically transform your body Dr  <br>00:00:13.519 Michael Israel is a leading Sports  <br>00:00:15.360 scientist who provides noons  <br>00:00:17.320 science-based strategies on muscle  <br>00:00:18.920 building fat loss and helping people  <br>00:00:21.160 maximize their Fitness potential my  <br>00:00:23.039 mission is to get everyone in as good of  <br>00:00:26.039 shape as possible with minimum time  <br>00:00:28.439 investment so where do we start so it's  <br>00:00:30.800 the consistency that matters doesn't  <br>00:00:32.598 matter if it's 2 hours a week or if it's  <br>00:00:34.200 18 hours a week if you're consistent you  <br>00:00:36.280 can get amazing benefits and then  <br>00:00:37.600 there's specificity which is the most  <br>00:00:39.320 important principle in all of exercise  <br>00:00:41.280 science that's telling yourself okay I  <br>00:00:42.640 want bigger biceps and then focus on  <br>00:00:44.680 that and also every real working set  <br>00:00:46.840 should be challenging is there a perfect  <br>00:00:48.879 amount of repetitions to do there is  <br>00:00:50.559 it's a trade secret but it's how long  <br>00:00:53.120 will it take me to lose the muscles that  <br>00:00:54.640 I've gained if I don't go back to the  <br>00:00:55.879 gym after about 2 weeks of not lifting  <br>00:00:57.800 we start to lose muscle but most people  <br>00:00:59.399 think oh my God another 8 months just to  <br>00:01:01.640 get back to where I started but when you  <br>00:01:03.359 gain an initial amount of muscle it  <br>00:01:04.959 never goes back to the same size as when  <br>00:01:06.640 you started it's just always going to be  <br>00:01:08.360 bigger and then got a couple of hours a  <br>00:01:10.119 week I just want to get a bit leaner and  <br>00:01:11.439 I want to gain some muscle okay the  <br>00:01:12.720 first thing we do is Dr Michael are  <br>00:01:15.520 there any supplements you suggest I take  <br>00:01:17.479 whey protein casum protein what about  <br>00:01:19.360 steroids Jesus Christ I'm really going  <br>00:01:21.600 to say this he's recently on like a  <br>00:01:23.960 boatload of steroids there are a few  <br>00:01:25.960 downsides what are the downsides that no  <br>00:01:27.439 one's talking about they're unspeakable  <br>00:01:29.520 you really want want  <br>00:01:33.320 know this is a sentence I

<br>00:02:22.000 heart let's get to the  <br>00:02:23.920 [Music]  <br>00:02:26.480 conversation Dr  <br>00:02:28.440 Michael what is the mission that you  <br>00:02:31.280 find yourself on in this phase of your  <br>00:02:34.319 life for those who would  <br>00:02:36.760 like to get everyone who would like in  <br>00:02:40.680 as good of shape as possible with as  <br>00:02:44.720 minimum of a Time investment injury  <br>00:02:48.239 probability and inconvenience in in  <br>00:02:52.239 general as possible and the highest  <br>00:02:54.000 likelihood of best results while trying  <br>00:02:56.480 to completely excise doing anything that  <br>00:02:59.440 is pointless and also I say this  <br>00:03:03.200 politely telling people things that  <br>00:03:06.280 aren't true we're trying to get as many  <br>00:03:08.680 people fit leaner more muscular more  <br>00:03:11.280 flexible healthier Etc as humanly  <br>00:03:14.560 possible to the extent that they are  <br>00:03:16.640 interested in that sort of thing because  <br>00:03:17.840 not everyone's into fitness and I  <br>00:03:19.159 understand that I mean I think I look  <br>00:03:20.799 kind of you know freaky and it scares  <br>00:03:22.519 certain people so I have a lot of time  <br>00:03:24.080 for that but if you want to get fit uh  <br>00:03:26.319 we're trying our best what are the the  <br>00:03:29.080 big myths that end up standing in the  <br>00:03:30.840 way of most people when they when they  <br>00:03:32.760 hear this conversation now what are the  <br>00:03:36.120 most frequent rebuttal that you'll get  <br>00:03:38.439 when you say that someone can get in  <br>00:03:39.879 shape and be be lean with limited time  <br>00:03:44.040 two super common ones  <br>00:03:46.360 are I don't have the time to work out  <br>00:03:50.319 and into that time to work out is  <br>00:03:52.599 included I don't have regular gym access  <br>00:03:55.040 or I technically do but I'd have to  <br>00:03:57.200 drive to the gym I just don't have the  <br>00:03:58.840 time of the bandwidth where I don't have  <br>00:04:00.280 the scheduling positioning in in my life  <br>00:04:02.400 to do this sort of thing and baked into  <br>00:04:05.519 that is the assumption that getting much  <br>00:04:08.000 healthier and much leaner and much more  <br>00:04:09.720 muscular takes like an inordinate amount  <br>00:04:11.720 of time one of the most common questions  <br>00:04:13.519 I get out in the real world when people  <br>00:04:15.599 happen to look in my general direction  <br>00:04:17.079 because usually people just kind of go  <br>00:04:18.358 like what the hell is wrong that guy's  <br>00:04:19.639 head but uh one of the most common  <br>00:04:22.120 questions I get is how many uh hours a  <br>00:04:25.120 day do you work out or how many days a  <br>00:04:26.800 week do you work out and every single  <br>00:04:28.560 person is expecting an answer that is  <br>00:04:31.160 kind of like asking the tallest  <br>00:04:33.080 basketball player you've ever met how  <br>00:04:34.520 tall they are you want an answer that's  <br>00:04:36.080 like 2 and a half meters you want  <br>00:04:38.080 something meaty and if they tell you  <br>00:04:39.600 like well I'm a meter 90 you're kind of  <br>00:04:41.479 like is that that cool and every time I  <br>00:04:44.120 tell them how much I work out which is  <br>00:04:45.680 really like it at my real like trying to  <br>00:04:49.160 be as good as bodybuilding as possible  <br>00:04:51.039 is really eight hours a week and this is  <br>00:04:53.919 to do this insane thing for people just  <br>00:04:57.400 trying to be fit and healthy Etc where  <br>00:04:59.880 talking about a sum total of 1 hour per  <br>00:05:02.800 week split into two or three 20ish  <br>00:05:06.280 minute sessions something we'll be  <br>00:05:07.520 trying later on is such a huge stimulus  <br>00:05:12.280 and can radically transform your body  <br>00:05:14.360 especially if you have attention to  <br>00:05:15.960 nutrition and that's the second thing  <br>00:05:17.800 that's a big Dogma big myth is people  <br>00:05:20.800 have ideas about what comes into  <br>00:05:24.720 nutrition and nutrition for being more  <br>00:05:27.639 lean more muscular and healthier they  <br>00:05:30.000 have all these kind of a constellation  <br>00:05:31.759 of ideas um uh Economist and philosopher  <br>00:05:34.840 Thomas soell calls them Notions so if  <br>00:05:36.759 you have a hierarchy of understanding  <br>00:05:38.919 you have Theory at the top which is like  <br>00:05:41.160 gravitation Evolution things super super  <br>00:05:43.199 confirmed just beneath that you have  <br>00:05:44.880 model like uh the standard model in  <br>00:05:46.840 physics is not quite good enough quite  <br>00:05:48.560 good enough support be a theory but it's  <br>00:05:50.120 very well understood space with a few  <br>00:05:51.680 Mysteries under that you have a  <br>00:05:53.880 hypothesis which is you know you have a  <br>00:05:56.160 real good idea formally phrased and  <br>00:05:58.479 underneath that you have a notion and an  <br>00:06:00.240 oce's just things people say and people  <br>00:06:02.400 are like uhhuh and no one even asks or  <br>00:06:04.800 answers about is this really true and so  <br>00:06:06.960 when you talk to people about nutrition  <br>00:06:08.240 or they talk to you about why they're  <br>00:06:10.160 not in such great shape another thing I  <br>00:06:12.000 get is when you're pretty jacked and  <br>00:06:13.560 lean and you sit next to someone on a  <br>00:06:15.000 plane they treat you almost like a  <br>00:06:16.759 religious figure like a priest or an  <br>00:06:18.120 imom and they're like apologize they're  <br>00:06:20.400 like Co you look like you're in good  <br>00:06:21.759 shape I just haven't been to the gym and  <br>00:06:23.000 I'm like I love you as a human being no  <br>00:06:25.039 matter all the time really all the time  <br>00:06:27.039 they apologize for the state they're in  <br>00:06:28.479 more or less yeah or they see me eat a  <br>00:06:29.960 protein bar and they're getting like the  <br>00:06:31.160 food on the plane and they're like this  <br>00:06:32.639 is bad for me huh and I'm like no it's  <br>00:06:34.080 actually quite fine and I always a  <br>00:06:35.319 little bit confused so all these ideas  <br>00:06:38.280 people have about nutrition organic  <br>00:06:41.280 artificial sweeteners are bad  <br>00:06:43.720 glutenfree GMOs um you have to have very  <br>00:06:47.520 meticulously well-prepared meals there  <br>00:06:49.840 is a ton of food that's huge laundr list  <br>00:06:52.240 of food that's unhealthy and bad for you  <br>00:06:53.800 makes you fat there are other foods that  <br>00:06:55.560 are a little bit more nuanced and  <br>00:06:56.840 difficult to find that are super Health  <br>00:06:58.120 Foods and'll radically transform you I  <br>00:06:59.879 can go on for hours about these myths  <br>00:07:01.759 but people come in with these myths as  <br>00:07:03.840 Notions as things they believe that  <br>00:07:05.479 they're like this is how it is right and  <br>00:07:07.400 when you tell them like actually that's  <br>00:07:09.000 not true a lot of them are  <br>00:07:11.240 like no way because maybe that's the  <br>00:07:13.639 first time they've heard about it so you  <br>00:07:14.960 tell people working out doesn't have to  <br>00:07:17.440 last forever if you do it intelligently  <br>00:07:19.840 which is what we specialize at RP about  <br>00:07:21.400 teaching people how to do and  <br>00:07:22.440 demonstrating digital  <br>00:07:24.000 products you can get into really really  <br>00:07:26.199 good shape with not so much time  <br>00:07:27.960 investment and it's not so difficult  <br>00:07:29.800 it's difficult in the moment as far as  <br>00:07:31.080 you got to try hard but you know an hour  <br>00:07:33.400 of trying hard a week is not the end of  <br>00:07:34.879 the world and then a nutritional front  <br>00:07:36.759 they come in and they think it takes all  <br>00:07:39.039 these crazy special things like people  <br>00:07:41.560 will watch me eat regular food and  <br>00:07:43.160 they'll be like you eat that I'm like  <br>00:07:45.400 yes like but I thought that you know but  <br>00:07:48.039 you need the super special food I like  <br>00:07:49.639 that's never been true but um people  <br>00:07:53.199 come in with their stack of ideas and  <br>00:07:57.319 these there's just dozens and dozens and  <br>00:07:59.520 myths on both ends we'll go through all  <br>00:08:01.400 of those myths but but my last question  <br>00:08:04.080 before we get into it is why does it  <br>00:08:06.520 matter to be in good shape and this is I  <br>00:08:09.639 I'm asking you here to really draw on  <br>00:08:11.280 some of the case studies that you've  <br>00:08:13.039 probably been exposed to where people  <br>00:08:15.000 have turned their lives around what is  <br>00:08:16.879 the net benefit of someone who's  <br>00:08:18.159 listening right now who's maybe heard  <br>00:08:19.479 about Fitness stuff before and has heard  <br>00:08:21.560 from personal trainers and bodybuilders  <br>00:08:23.400 and whoever else but for whatever reason  <br>00:08:25.199 they just haven't been able to get up  <br>00:08:26.680 off the sofa and get into action it's  <br>00:08:28.400 difficult you know what is why should  <br>00:08:30.520 they why should they C I love that  <br>00:08:32.519 question the first thing I'll say is um  <br>00:08:37.240 is maybe not a surprise to many of the  <br>00:08:39.240 people that know me politically I'm like  <br>00:08:41.799 super pro freedom freedom of all kinds  <br>00:08:44.279 inclusion and that means to me also that  <br>00:08:47.279 if someone doesn't want to pursue  <br>00:08:48.880 Fitness as a human being you have the  <br>00:08:51.160 same love and respect at least for me  <br>00:08:53.120 that anyone who's fit would have and so  <br>00:08:55.800 as far as like it'll just make you a  <br>00:08:57.640 better person and you you got to get fit  <br>00:08:59.640 people will see uh people that are obese  <br>00:09:02.120 and they're like look lazy and uh how do  <br>00:09:04.120 they live with themselves I don't ever  <br>00:09:06.160 think things like that not because I'm a  <br>00:09:08.079 good person I'm not a good person at all  <br>00:09:09.959 but what Fitness won't give you is it  <br>00:09:12.760 won't elevate your status as a better  <br>00:09:15.160 person in some way however the other  <br>00:09:19.839 benefits of Fitness we could have a  <br>00:09:22.720 10-hour podcast where I just go through  <br>00:09:24.640 them one one at a time and we would  <br>00:09:26.120 never get through all of them I'll give  <br>00:09:27.320 you a couple of samplings of kind of the  <br>00:09:28.680 big hitters  <br>00:09:30.600 one is Health straight up so if you  <br>00:09:34.320 reduce your body fat substantially and  <br>00:09:36.160 you increase your muscularity  <br>00:09:37.360 substantially and you adopt a lifestyle  <br>00:09:39.600 of moderate to moderately High physical  <br>00:09:43.000 activity quite  <br>00:09:45.120 regularly this is about as close in real  <br>00:09:47.240 life as we have so far to a Panacea a  <br>00:09:49.120 cure all it isn't cure all but the  <br>00:09:51.760 degree of  <br>00:09:54.000 preventative uh you won't get really  <br>00:09:56.240 sick very soon effect that has is just  <br>00:10:00.440 radical I uh just coming off of them but  <br>00:10:04.360 if it's okay to say it was recently on  <br>00:10:06.279 like a boatload of steroids like the  <br>00:10:08.920 worst ones got blood work right in the  <br>00:10:11.760 middle of that because I was very lean  <br>00:10:14.200 and very physically active and muscular  <br>00:10:16.120 my blood Works Stellar just being leaner  <br>00:10:18.880 and more muscular and more active just  <br>00:10:21.240 cleans your blood work up like  <br>00:10:23.560 crazyy and makes your longterm it  <br>00:10:27.040 increases your longevity considerably  <br>00:10:29.320 but it does something I think is pretty  <br>00:10:30.920 close to equally important it  <br>00:10:33.200 increases the kind of time you're having  <br>00:10:35.480 in your life while you're alive uh it  <br>00:10:38.680 makes it way better it reduces the  <br>00:10:40.680 morbidity and so because you can be  <br>00:10:42.600 around a long time living in an assisted  <br>00:10:44.720 care facility and like on machines to  <br>00:10:46.800 keep you that's you're alive sure but  <br>00:10:49.120 there something missing there but if you  <br>00:10:51.079 have more muscle less fat and more  <br>00:10:53.079 physical activity you ever see like an  <br>00:10:55.079 80-year-old that's like cardio walking  <br>00:10:56.680 down the street and you're like my man  <br>00:10:58.880 it'll you that so that's a big deal so  <br>00:11:01.440 Health it'll give you usually people  <br>00:11:04.279 experience a perception of Wellness  <br>00:11:06.160 that's psychological they just feel  <br>00:11:08.760 better they feel cleaner they feel more  <br>00:11:11.880 energy the cognitive benefits of health  <br>00:11:14.399 and fitness are now being addressed  <br>00:11:16.000 seriously in the literature and they  <br>00:11:17.240 have been for a little while but it's  <br>00:11:18.360 kind of  <br>00:11:19.519 swelling uh is unequivocally true now to  <br>00:11:22.360 say that regularly engaging in Fitness  <br>00:11:24.959 makes you literally smarter just  <br>00:11:27.480 straight up and it conserves your  <br>00:11:31.000 brain's cognitive health for decades  <br>00:11:34.600 into the future as you do it  <br>00:11:36.279 consistently it's just win all the way  <br>00:11:38.480 across what is your background in terms  <br>00:11:42.519 of your academic qualifications and  <br>00:11:45.279 experiences that you've had that feed  <br>00:11:47.360 into everything that you know this is  <br>00:11:49.360 sounds so pretentious I can't believe  <br>00:11:50.880 I'm using this nomenclature but I did my  <br>00:11:53.120 undergraduate work at the University of  <br>00:11:56.040 Michigan where I met uh my fellow  <br>00:11:58.800 co-founder of RP Nick Shaw and um that  <br>00:12:03.040 was in kinesiology uh specifically a  <br>00:12:05.639 subset of something called movement  <br>00:12:07.079 science I then went on to do a master's  <br>00:12:10.279 in technically strength and conditioning  <br>00:12:12.120 but exercise science at appalachin State  <br>00:12:14.560 University then I went for one year to  <br>00:12:17.079 go work in New York City with Nick as a  <br>00:12:19.160 personal trainer at the end of that  <br>00:12:21.519 process I realized that for my own  <br>00:12:23.600 personal like Vibe I just didn't know  <br>00:12:25.680 enough and I wanted to know more and so  <br>00:12:28.880 I got accepted to a PhD program at East  <br>00:12:30.800 Tennessee State University under the  <br>00:12:32.160 great Mike Stone who is probably one of  <br>00:12:34.880 the most well-published sports  <br>00:12:35.959 scientists of all time maybe definitely  <br>00:12:38.399 the conversation for the greatest  <br>00:12:39.519 American Sports scientist of all time  <br>00:12:42.079 and I went to that PhD program and that  <br>00:12:44.760 was in sport physiology and the best way  <br>00:12:46.600 we had of summarizing what it is we were  <br>00:12:48.399 learning is the thing we're learning  <br>00:12:50.240 best here is how to take good athletes  <br>00:12:52.040 and make them better and so I did three  <br>00:12:54.240 years of that it sounds like a it's like  <br>00:12:55.639 a prison time I did three years in  <br>00:12:57.600 ETSU and uh that was the conclusion I  <br>00:13:01.279 was a terminal degree I got a PhD in  <br>00:13:02.839 sport physiology and then I spent oh gez  <br>00:13:05.720 10 years in various uh professorships uh  <br>00:13:08.720 teaching and doing some research and all  <br>00:13:10.959 this other stuff I'm no longer a college  <br>00:13:13.040 professor mostly because like there's  <br>00:13:15.760 only so many things you can do at the  <br>00:13:17.240 same time well and it was kind of like  <br>00:13:19.440 this is this YouTube thing is getting  <br>00:13:20.880 kind of insane so time to Pivot to that  <br>00:13:23.320 but uh I'm still actively involved in  <br>00:13:25.360 research our company funds research I  <br>00:13:26.959 still look at manuscripts I still  <br>00:13:28.199 co-author so I'm still involved in that  <br>00:13:29.800 capacity as well so I want to start with  <br>00:13:31.519 a start if someone's listening to this  <br>00:13:33.720 right now and they have walked into your  <br>00:13:36.440 this is your uh this is your practice  <br>00:13:38.839 this is your hypertrophy practice let's  <br>00:13:40.440 say this table and they sit there and  <br>00:13:42.720 they say I would like to gain more lean  <br>00:13:45.800 muscle mass and I'd like to lose some  <br>00:13:48.519 weight um I live A busy life where do we  <br>00:13:52.120 start what step one and you know like  <br>00:13:54.839 I'm actually going to Hazard a guess at  <br>00:13:56.040 step one to see if I'm correct but for  <br>00:13:58.480 me step one is quite psychological  <br>00:14:00.920 because it's all well and good me having  <br>00:14:02.199 the tactics and strategies and the  <br>00:14:03.800 information but if I don't have the  <br>00:14:05.639 motivation none of it's going to matter  <br>00:14:08.079 anyway so is step one psychological in  <br>00:14:11.560 some way absolutely my God you should  <br>00:14:14.079 just be taking my job with this point no  <br>00:14:15.519 but okay I thought so I thought that was  <br>00:14:17.160 so what what would you do for me to get  <br>00:14:19.079 me in the right psychological  <br>00:14:21.480 mindset I would even take a step back  <br>00:14:23.600 before that okay the first thing we do  <br>00:14:26.920 is called the needs analysis and formal  <br>00:14:29.399 Sport Science a needs analysis is what  <br>00:14:33.519 do you  <br>00:14:34.600 want specifically do you want bigger  <br>00:14:37.720 arms how much muscle are you trying to  <br>00:14:40.079 gain it's a very different conversation  <br>00:14:41.560 of someone weighs 150 pounds and they're  <br>00:14:44.040 like I want to be 155 but leaner versus  <br>00:14:47.040 I weigh 150 pounds and I want to be 200  <br>00:14:49.920 ripped different timelines different  <br>00:14:52.000 approaches different trade-offs okay  <br>00:14:53.440 give me the  <br>00:14:54.399 typical answer to that question most  <br>00:14:57.360 people just open-ended to be completely  <br>00:14:58.839 honest honest you're like I just want to  <br>00:15:00.279 get much leaner and some of them will  <br>00:15:02.320 say I also want to put on a lot of  <br>00:15:03.720 muscle the muscle thing is a lot of  <br>00:15:06.040 times with females they just want the  <br>00:15:07.519 leaner part but they understand in many  <br>00:15:10.000 cases that if they just jettison their  <br>00:15:12.600 muscle entirely they end up looking more  <br>00:15:14.399 sick than healthy uh but a lot of the  <br>00:15:16.800 males leaner is important but also  <br>00:15:18.920 getting super jacked is important but  <br>00:15:20.920 how jacked and how lean that's the  <br>00:15:23.120 conversation is if they come in with  <br>00:15:24.880 totally open-ended concerns it's kind of  <br>00:15:26.399 like walking into a car dealership and  <br>00:15:27.600 being like I want a car like you going  <br>00:15:28.720 to have to be a little I we'll sell you  <br>00:15:30.120 whatever you're going to have to tell me  <br>00:15:31.680 a little bit more about what your use  <br>00:15:32.959 cases are about what your budget is so  <br>00:15:35.240 that's another big thing in a need  <br>00:15:36.399 analysis is how much time can you give  <br>00:15:40.000 to this because if someone says I want  <br>00:15:43.040 to eventually be a professional  <br>00:15:45.120 bodybuilder and I've got nothing but  <br>00:15:47.480 time in my week to do the thing think  <br>00:15:49.880 getting a very different plan than  <br>00:15:51.199 someone that's like I just want to be  <br>00:15:53.839 able to see my man down there again and  <br>00:15:57.959 like just not die soon and I have two  <br>00:16:02.120 hours a week to give you very different  <br>00:16:04.880 plan so I've got let's say I've got a  <br>00:16:07.319 couple of hours a week so you know two  <br>00:16:09.319 three hours a week that I could probably  <br>00:16:11.519 spare maybe four and I just want to get  <br>00:16:14.040 a bit leaner and I want to gain some  <br>00:16:15.360 muscle yeah I also ask what have you  <br>00:16:19.240 been doing so far tell me about your  <br>00:16:21.680 approach to Fitness and the answer could  <br>00:16:23.160 be I don't have one I've never tried to  <br>00:16:25.680 do anything once we get a lot of that  <br>00:16:27.920 information I don't want to say the plan  <br>00:16:29.839 writes itself but sort of almost now we  <br>00:16:33.120 really really really have all the  <br>00:16:35.560 details to fill in the blanks and then  <br>00:16:38.279 from there once you've done that sort of  <br>00:16:39.360 needs analysis and you've understood the  <br>00:16:40.759 investment that they're willing to make  <br>00:16:42.199 you understand what their goals are you  <br>00:16:44.240 understand their current approach to  <br>00:16:45.440 Fitness what becomes step two so if  <br>00:16:48.680 again I'm trying to embody the viewer  <br>00:16:50.000 here who's trying to change their life  <br>00:16:51.600 yeah yeah get going for step two often  <br>00:16:53.600 times uh just to keep it SCH we can I we  <br>00:16:56.079 definitely do nutrition uh if you'd like  <br>00:16:57.800 so please C me in for that but I'll just  <br>00:16:59.360 use um training as a quick example here  <br>00:17:02.480 uh a big one is do you go to a gym can  <br>00:17:07.400 you make it to a gym or are you going to  <br>00:17:09.160 be training at home because training at  <br>00:17:11.880 home is a bit of a different world you  <br>00:17:13.559 can get amazing results at home but we  <br>00:17:15.599 need to make sure you have the right  <br>00:17:16.760 equipment and it's super minimal two 20  <br>00:17:19.839 lb dumbbells I like that you're looking  <br>00:17:21.760 over at the dumbbells like are those 20  <br>00:17:23.919 kg dumbbells they're 20 pound dumbbells  <br>00:17:26.280 is that what I need at home for many  <br>00:17:28.240 people 20 like adult males white spry  <br>00:17:31.039 like yourself 20 pound dumbbells at home  <br>00:17:33.440 will give you phenomenal overall result  <br>00:17:37.039 yeah what is that nine kgs or something  <br>00:17:40.120 oh here we go your assistance are quite  <br>00:17:42.919 strong by the way thank do you fight  <br>00:17:44.760 crime in your spare  <br>00:17:47.480 time okay so these are 20 pound  <br>00:17:50.840 dumbbells You're just showing off now  <br>00:17:52.840 but but these are what I need at home to  <br>00:17:54.799 to do a workout uh yeah somewhere  <br>00:17:56.799 between 10 and 20 pounds 10 for small  <br>00:17:58.840 smaller lighter females 20 for larger  <br>00:18:01.799 more strong males somewhere between that  <br>00:18:04.480 two of those dumbbells at home and a  <br>00:18:06.799 little bit of floor space can be the  <br>00:18:08.480 beginning of an absolutely revolutionary  <br>00:18:10.400 workout program really yeah oh yeah how  <br>00:18:13.960 so give me the starting position and the  <br>00:18:16.960 end position that I could get to just  <br>00:18:19.559 with these dumbbells at home if you  <br>00:18:22.600 properly control your diet and you  <br>00:18:24.880 haven't really lifted weights before and  <br>00:18:27.039 you're let's say 30 40 50 years old in a  <br>00:18:30.440 6month time span we can reliably get you  <br>00:18:34.000 to gain 5 to 10 lounds of muscle which  <br>00:18:37.400 if you go to the store what is that like  <br>00:18:39.600 five let's say the two to five kilos of  <br>00:18:42.559 muscle you ever buy two to five kilos of  <br>00:18:44.880 meat at the store that's a lot of meat  <br>00:18:47.240 that's going on your body and we can  <br>00:18:49.720 reliably get you to lose oh gee five to  <br>00:18:54.799 7 and 1 12 kilos of fat in a six-month  <br>00:18:57.400 time frame just by being intelligent  <br>00:18:59.720 about your diet and doing two workouts  <br>00:19:03.120 per week at home with your dumbbells and  <br>00:19:05.840 the workouts each take roughly 20  <br>00:19:08.760 minutes so that's 40 minutes a week oh  <br>00:19:12.440 yeah now that's if you're unaccustomed  <br>00:19:14.039 and unadjusted if you have already and  <br>00:19:16.159 that's why those intake questions are  <br>00:19:17.400 important because if you're like look I  <br>00:19:18.720 go to the gym six times a week I spend  <br>00:19:20.120 two hours at the gym like them dumbbells  <br>00:19:22.320 can keep you in pretty good shape but  <br>00:19:24.480 they're not going to elevate your shape  <br>00:19:25.679 very likely at very least it'll be  <br>00:19:27.640 highly inefficient and incredibly  <br>00:19:29.200 discomforting for what you'd have to do  <br>00:19:30.679 with such  <br>00:19:31.760 dumbbells so what is step three then so  <br>00:19:34.080 if we've got the equipment part figured  <br>00:19:35.640 out and I guess the complicated element  <br>00:19:37.520 of that is some people have anxiety as  <br>00:19:40.240 it relates to going to the gym I've got  <br>00:19:41.480 a lot of friends that because they're so  <br>00:19:44.039 inexperienced with weightlifting or the  <br>00:19:45.799 machines they feel embarrassed to go to  <br>00:19:48.240 the gym so that well at least that's  <br>00:19:50.720 what they tell me now I don't know  <br>00:19:51.880 whether they're Beering themselves but  <br>00:19:53.679 they tell me that they have gym anxiety  <br>00:19:56.000 you know you walk and I no actually I  <br>00:19:57.320 can relate you walk into a gym  <br>00:19:58.679 especially if I go to like a uh like a  <br>00:20:00.320 bodybuilding gym and I do look around I  <br>00:20:02.480 go okay everyone here knows what they're  <br>00:20:03.640 doing more than I do o that's already  <br>00:20:05.720 wrong but we'll get to that a bit and  <br>00:20:07.240 are they looking at me are they do they  <br>00:20:08.919 know that I I don't know how this  <br>00:20:10.280 machine works and if I don't know how a  <br>00:20:11.919 machine works and there's nothing you  <br>00:20:13.720 know No Label to tell me sometimes I  <br>00:20:15.360 just avoid the machine if I'm in in like  <br>00:20:16.919 a bodybuilding gym because I [ __ ]  <br>00:20:18.600 hell I don't know how to do my wrist  <br>00:20:20.880 muscles yeah I just look like a doofus  <br>00:20:23.480 and everyone's making fun of me in their  <br>00:20:24.720 head what I think sometimes if I go to  <br>00:20:26.080 like a really Elite Gym so yeah so first  <br>00:20:28.880 of all I think people's gym anxiety is  <br>00:20:30.799 absolutely real thing I can speak to  <br>00:20:32.240 that at at length The Next Step would be  <br>00:20:35.799 to say Hey listen based on all the  <br>00:20:38.559 information we've collected on your  <br>00:20:39.880 limitations desires abilities we've  <br>00:20:43.120 cultivated a plan for you be diet plan  <br>00:20:45.559 and just just stick into the muscle  <br>00:20:47.080 growth  <br>00:20:48.200 stuff here's your plan for your  <br>00:20:52.760 training and we actually have an app for  <br>00:20:55.640 this sort of thing where we would say  <br>00:20:57.840 okay here's how you you type in all your  <br>00:20:59.320 stuff in the app the app will create a  <br>00:21:01.120 plan for you and it'll tell you here's  <br>00:21:03.919 what to do for warming up here's you  <br>00:21:05.960 know you pick a weight it tells you how  <br>00:21:07.159 to pick your weights and then it  <br>00:21:08.440 programs the rest of your two months of  <br>00:21:10.880 training for you you fill in the how do  <br>00:21:12.799 we how do I feel how am I recovering  <br>00:21:14.279 it'll take care of everything else and  <br>00:21:16.720 if you ever get confused you click on  <br>00:21:18.600 the exercise and it opens up a video  <br>00:21:20.840 with an audio demonstration of how to do  <br>00:21:23.880 it and of someone a professional  <br>00:21:25.960 bodybuilder doing the thing you go oh  <br>00:21:28.120 that's that's what bicep curls was okay  <br>00:21:29.880 got it so now you have all the answers  <br>00:21:31.880 and you don't have to have our app we  <br>00:21:34.039 think it's nice you don't have to have  <br>00:21:35.320 it just whatever kind of plan you have  <br>00:21:38.200 that's your little map of the Caribbean  <br>00:21:40.080 Sea with the AIS and the pirate ships  <br>00:21:42.240 and you know exactly where to go and  <br>00:21:44.240 it's you your app or your map of how to  <br>00:21:47.320 train your program and everyone else  <br>00:21:50.440 like in The Avengers movie it's just  <br>00:21:53.279 just floats away there's no one else  <br>00:21:54.960 there's not even any other machines it's  <br>00:21:56.559 you and the bicep curl machine  <br>00:21:59.159 and the hypertrophy app says first set  <br>00:22:01.440 is 12 reps at 50 pounds I take the  <br>00:22:03.360 select Dr stack I go to 50 and I'm nice  <br>00:22:05.559 and warmed up and I do 12 reps and  <br>00:22:07.799 that's as far as you have to think about  <br>00:22:09.120 it comparisons whatever everyone else  <br>00:22:10.679 thinks without a plan oh boy are you  <br>00:22:13.120 second guessing yourself with a plan you  <br>00:22:15.320 don't have to second guess anything most  <br>00:22:16.520 those people don't have a plan they're  <br>00:22:17.440 just in there on Vibes I feel like my  <br>00:22:19.000 delts are going to grow today if I do  <br>00:22:20.320 this like thanks thanks for that  <br>00:22:22.039 intellectual opinion you said there's  <br>00:22:24.000 two types of effective training one of  <br>00:22:27.039 them's H H can't say this but one of  <br>00:22:29.240 them is hypertrophy very good and the  <br>00:22:31.600 other one is  <br>00:22:33.760 periodization uh so periodization is the  <br>00:22:37.480 scientifically based organization of any  <br>00:22:39.880 kind of training that you want okay  <br>00:22:41.919 hypertrophy training is a type of  <br>00:22:43.679 training it's just muscle growth  <br>00:22:44.880 training it's like a fancy [ __ ]  <br>00:22:46.880 science word for just getting more  <br>00:22:49.440 jacked putting on muscle that's the  <br>00:22:51.919 technical definition of hypertrophy and  <br>00:22:54.360 when you train for hypertrophy you can  <br>00:22:56.080 do it kind of like by feel and more or  <br>00:22:57.880 less at random and you'll get pretty  <br>00:22:59.120 good results in most cases but to get  <br>00:23:00.960 your best results you want that training  <br>00:23:02.320 to be periodized periodization is the  <br>00:23:05.760 scientific approach to how to organize  <br>00:23:07.559 your training to get sort of roughly  <br>00:23:09.640 three things some of these are a bit  <br>00:23:11.240 more for athletes and not regular people  <br>00:23:13.919 get the best results that you can Peak  <br>00:23:16.679 at an appropriate time abs for summer  <br>00:23:19.520 and minimize injury risk and taking all  <br>00:23:22.400 the science that we know that plan that  <br>00:23:24.559 you've made because you did in an  <br>00:23:26.559 evidence-based fashion that is now what  <br>00:23:28.760 is considered a periodized plan so  <br>00:23:31.039 that's how those two concepts relate to  <br>00:23:32.960 each other what do I need to know about  <br>00:23:35.000 hypertrophy in order to be able to  <br>00:23:36.960 achieve it is there anything really  <br>00:23:38.440 foundational because I think everyone  <br>00:23:40.840 wants a bit of muscle growth and I spend  <br>00:23:42.880 I think I spend too long in the gym I  <br>00:23:44.159 think I could be much more efficient um  <br>00:23:46.360 when I'm training what would you  <br>00:23:48.480 recommend that I start thinking about as  <br>00:23:50.720 F foundational principles when it comes  <br>00:23:52.799 to hypertrophy muscle growth one is  <br>00:23:56.320 specificity it's the most important  <br>00:23:58.440 principle in all of sport painting and  <br>00:24:00.440 exercise science is uh what am I here  <br>00:24:03.919 for what do I want because you can do a  <br>00:24:06.919 bunch of exercises in the gym and you're  <br>00:24:09.159 like that was great and someone's like  <br>00:24:10.720 are you getting the results you like  <br>00:24:11.679 you're like well I what I want is a  <br>00:24:13.120 bigger bicep like how many bicep  <br>00:24:14.720 exercises do you do like I think upright  <br>00:24:16.720 rows maybe so I want a bigger bicep  <br>00:24:18.840 bicep if we just focus on me give  <br>00:24:20.440 getting Steven B a bigger left bicep so  <br>00:24:24.760 specificity is telling yourself okay I  <br>00:24:26.279 want bigger biceps and whatever XYZ  <br>00:24:28.399 other  <br>00:24:29.200 muscles then we move in to the principle  <br>00:24:32.399 of overload which means you have to  <br>00:24:35.120 challenge  <br>00:24:36.440 yourself if most of your  <br>00:24:39.559 sets someone else watching them can't  <br>00:24:42.080 tell if you're warming up or doing  <br>00:24:43.600 what's called a working set like a real  <br>00:24:45.159 set you have a problem so towards the  <br>00:24:48.039 end of all of your sets either the  <br>00:24:50.360 weights are slowing down or even if it's  <br>00:24:53.720 the same speed to you they feel  <br>00:24:55.480 perceptively harder you know you do this  <br>00:24:57.960 this this and in a couple reps you're  <br>00:25:00.720 like that's what you want every real  <br>00:25:03.600 working set should be challenging you  <br>00:25:05.720 should be work approaching every real  <br>00:25:07.320 set with just a teeny teeny dose of  <br>00:25:09.600 trepidation like oh boy here we go I'm  <br>00:25:13.000 GNA have to  <br>00:25:14.279 try once you have that and a set is a a  <br>00:25:18.080 group of repetitions correct so if I do  <br>00:25:20.720 10 repetitions that's one set one set  <br>00:25:22.799 yeah and so your sets have to be  <br>00:25:25.399 sufficiently heavy uh anything between  <br>00:25:28.320 between roughly five reps per set and 30  <br>00:25:31.200 reps per set where the last few reps are  <br>00:25:33.440 getting close to you not being able to  <br>00:25:34.919 use good technique and lift the weights  <br>00:25:37.279 check plus so there's not a set a  <br>00:25:39.640 perfect amount of repetitions to do  <br>00:25:41.840 there is it's a trade secret and I'd  <br>00:25:43.279 have to say it off camera to you like ND  <br>00:25:45.600 assign okay we're off camera all right  <br>00:25:47.080 great so it's  <br>00:25:48.480 17 um there is so there's just tons of  <br>00:25:51.880 tons of contextual Nuance kind of stuff  <br>00:25:54.720 some people some of their muscles will  <br>00:25:56.600 seem respond better to sets a five to 10  <br>00:25:59.279 other folks even the same person could  <br>00:26:01.159 have muscles in their body that really  <br>00:26:02.360 respond better to sets of 20 to 30 and  <br>00:26:04.840 everything in between but generally you  <br>00:26:06.039 get in in the exercise science data  <br>00:26:09.039 you'll have a group of people training  <br>00:26:10.919 for sets of roughly five reps and  <br>00:26:13.360 another group training for sets of  <br>00:26:14.760 roughly 30 reps and their change in  <br>00:26:17.039 muscle growth over 8 12 16 weeks is  <br>00:26:19.480 statistically undifferenced  <br>00:26:28.600 that's so crazy using the same weight  <br>00:26:30.760 I'm guessing different weight a weight  <br>00:26:32.840 that is challenging for five reps is  <br>00:26:34.279 much heavier than a weight that is  <br>00:26:35.320 challenging for 30 okay so I do Wonder  <br>00:26:37.200 this all the time when I go to the gym I  <br>00:26:38.279 wonder if I should be doing I don't know  <br>00:26:40.320 30 reps of 10 kg on my bicep or I should  <br>00:26:42.960 be doing 10 reps of 20 kg they're both  <br>00:26:46.360 right answers no wrong answers there and  <br>00:26:48.120 they both have the same chance of  <br>00:26:50.559 growing my muscles as long as the strain  <br>00:26:53.120 that I experience subjectively is  <br>00:26:55.799 difficult at the end of those set  <br>00:26:57.080 correct okay interesting which is really  <br>00:26:59.120 good news because that's like another  <br>00:27:00.360 thing you don't have to worry about  <br>00:27:01.760 which means at home I can get any range  <br>00:27:03.159 of Weights versus having to get really  <br>00:27:05.559 really big ones to gr as long as they're  <br>00:27:07.039 not so tiny that you're on rep number 45  <br>00:27:09.120 and you're like I could just do this for  <br>00:27:10.240 forever or they're not so enormous that  <br>00:27:12.240 you're like I can't really even do two  <br>00:27:13.679 reps of this anything between roughly  <br>00:27:15.399 five and roughly 30 reps challenging is  <br>00:27:18.159 really really good how many sets and how  <br>00:27:21.240 often do I have to visit the gym to get  <br>00:27:24.279 this bicep to grow that answer depends  <br>00:27:26.640 on how much you've been doing before  <br>00:27:28.640 okay but if you're new to the gym two  <br>00:27:31.559 sessions a week with two to three sets  <br>00:27:35.440 per session for your biceps is something  <br>00:27:38.640 that's going to cause months and months  <br>00:27:40.200 and months of consistent progress can  <br>00:27:42.559 you do more yes do you have to do as a  <br>00:27:45.760 beginner no eventually as a more  <br>00:27:48.000 advanced person do you need to do more  <br>00:27:50.039 sets and perhaps more sessions to get  <br>00:27:51.679 consistently better results yes but for  <br>00:27:53.919 beginners who haven't been in the gym  <br>00:27:55.200 very much or at all the minimal  <br>00:27:57.320 effective dose is profoundly small which  <br>00:28:00.640 is why I can say things like if you work  <br>00:28:02.039 out for 20 minutes twice a week you're  <br>00:28:03.360 going to get great gains what if I go to  <br>00:28:05.480 the gym and I do six sets on my biceps  <br>00:28:09.120 and I just go to the gym once a week  <br>00:28:10.960 does the distance between the workouts  <br>00:28:13.519 in a muscle group have an impact yes  <br>00:28:16.919 once a week training gives you good  <br>00:28:18.880 results but twice a week training for  <br>00:28:21.240 the same muscle gives you notably better  <br>00:28:24.799 results training three times a week  <br>00:28:27.559 versus twice tce training four times a  <br>00:28:29.840 week versus three times training five  <br>00:28:31.799 times a week versus four times is uh an  <br>00:28:35.279 an exponentially de-escalating amount of  <br>00:28:37.919 impressive differences so one time a  <br>00:28:40.320 week Works it'll get you results two  <br>00:28:43.320 times a week gets you like one and a  <br>00:28:45.120 half times the results like way better  <br>00:28:47.919 better three times a week is like  <br>00:28:50.399 another little bit more results still  <br>00:28:52.320 notable four times a week is like you  <br>00:28:54.519 got to be training for a while to notice  <br>00:28:56.120 the difference between three and four  <br>00:28:58.080 four and five is contextual and nuanced  <br>00:29:00.000 and I can't actually tell you that  <br>00:29:01.320 categorically 5 days a week is better  <br>00:29:03.080 than four there are some things I would  <br>00:29:04.720 have to know about your plan and  <br>00:29:05.799 everything else to make that conclusion  <br>00:29:07.159 so really I want to be aiming at twice a  <br>00:29:08.559 week per muscle group twice is our  <br>00:29:10.279 minimum two to four times a week is what  <br>00:29:11.880 I say is kind of the best overall  <br>00:29:13.480 recommendation per muscle group and if  <br>00:29:15.799 you train all of your muscles together  <br>00:29:17.519 at the same time a whole body workout  <br>00:29:19.039 which most people in the realm of just  <br>00:29:20.880 I'm busy and I can't train a lot it  <br>00:29:22.640 would be all of the major muscles of  <br>00:29:24.519 your body in the same session twice or  <br>00:29:28.440 three times or four times a week and  <br>00:29:30.039 that is an awesome beginner fitness plan  <br>00:29:32.840 what's going on in my muscles that's  <br>00:29:35.519 encouraging them and making them grow  <br>00:29:37.480 and when are they growing is it when I  <br>00:29:38.720 go to bed at night is it when I do they  <br>00:29:40.559 grow the minute that I curl the the  <br>00:29:42.799 dumbbell what's actually going on  <br>00:29:44.640 because sometimes understanding what's  <br>00:29:45.960 actually going on inside helps me to  <br>00:29:47.519 think through and change my behavior  <br>00:29:50.000 yeah so uh the primary stimulus for  <br>00:29:53.600 muscle growth is there are molecular  <br>00:29:56.320 machines in your muscles in your muscle  <br>00:29:58.919 cells and they are designed to detect  <br>00:30:01.960 the presence of  <br>00:30:04.360 tension and when your muscles generate  <br>00:30:06.559 tension the molecular detector machines  <br>00:30:08.559 go o we got tension here and they start  <br>00:30:11.320 uh saying to other parts of the cells  <br>00:30:13.039 like hey uh let's get this muscle growth  <br>00:30:14.679 thing started started not happening  <br>00:30:16.679 started it's a stimulus of muscle growth  <br>00:30:19.080 there are a couple of other mechanisms  <br>00:30:20.600 which might SL probably have an effect  <br>00:30:24.840 and that a couple of them are metabolite  <br>00:30:26.960 sequestration which is a very fancy way  <br>00:30:28.880 of saying the burn you know at the end  <br>00:30:30.559 of a set you're like ah the metabolites  <br>00:30:33.799 the um byproducts of training if they  <br>00:30:36.480 accumulate to high levels it's been  <br>00:30:37.880 shown in tons of animal studies and a  <br>00:30:40.000 few human studies that like  <br>00:30:41.640 mechanistically they might also tell the  <br>00:30:43.399 molecular Machinery that grows muscle  <br>00:30:45.000 for you again later to uh hey get the  <br>00:30:48.240 muscle growth process another one is the  <br>00:30:49.760 pump so you know you do a couple sets of  <br>00:30:51.399 biceps you're oh my God what's going on  <br>00:30:53.320 here baby flash it at some girl she runs  <br>00:30:55.399 away as usual and the actual cell  <br>00:30:58.440 swelling itself might play a causal  <br>00:31:01.399 mechanistic role in generating more  <br>00:31:03.159 muscle growth but but we know it's  <br>00:31:04.960 probably at least at Le least 80% of the  <br>00:31:07.720 muscle growth anyone will see is because  <br>00:31:09.840 of those receptors for tension muscle  <br>00:31:13.320 growth as soon as you leave the gym is a  <br>00:31:16.200 negative because the gym is catabolic  <br>00:31:18.440 it's a breaks down your muscle actually  <br>00:31:21.120 training breaks down more muscle than it  <br>00:31:23.559 builds however as you go home and you  <br>00:31:26.919 start eating food protein carbs fats and  <br>00:31:30.039 you have several meals per day and  <br>00:31:32.399 you're resting when the food's coming in  <br>00:31:35.120 several hours after training begins if  <br>00:31:37.360 you measure muscle growth consistently  <br>00:31:39.000 which is really difficult to do they  <br>00:31:40.320 don't do it super often you have to keep  <br>00:31:41.960 people in a laboratory you have to do  <br>00:31:43.240 radioactive tracers and measure all this  <br>00:31:45.200 weird  <br>00:31:46.200 stuff every couple of hours they measure  <br>00:31:48.720 the amount of muscle growth that's going  <br>00:31:50.399 on in the biceps goes up and up and up  <br>00:31:52.200 and up and it usually Peaks  <br>00:31:53.840 about half a day to a day and a half  <br>00:31:56.880 after you lift depend depending on how  <br>00:31:58.360 hard you went if it's a pretty easy  <br>00:31:59.679 workout it Peaks a little sooner and  <br>00:32:02.440 Dives and drops off about a day or two  <br>00:32:04.480 later if you train really crazy hard  <br>00:32:07.159 it'll Peak like a day day and a half  <br>00:32:08.679 later and then half a week later it'll  <br>00:32:10.399 drop off back to Baseline levels but  <br>00:32:12.559 it's this really smooth curve and you're  <br>00:32:15.880 growing muscle at every single point  <br>00:32:17.559 under that curve So when you say is it  <br>00:32:19.600 while I'm sleeping is it while I'm  <br>00:32:20.679 eating is it while I'm resting the aners  <br>00:32:22.320 all of those except it's not at the gym  <br>00:32:25.200 you don't grow muscle at the gym you  <br>00:32:26.919 give yourself a signal to grow muscle at  <br>00:32:28.480 the gym and then what you do outside of  <br>00:32:30.039 the gym matters so some people train  <br>00:32:31.320 really hard they don't eat right they  <br>00:32:33.159 don't need enough protein their sleep is  <br>00:32:35.080 total insert bad word here and their  <br>00:32:37.799 stress levels are just totally psychotic  <br>00:32:40.320 they train hard and then week after week  <br>00:32:42.440 after week they're like not seeing any  <br>00:32:44.720 results well the results are actually  <br>00:32:46.440 created when you're resting when you're  <br>00:32:48.480 sleeping when you're eating nutritious  <br>00:32:49.960 food they're stimulated in the workout  <br>00:32:52.880 but that's just phase one phase two the  <br>00:32:54.840 actual growth occurs outside the gym and  <br>00:32:56.720 it occurs not in any any specific time  <br>00:32:58.639 Point like a Magic Window of two hours  <br>00:33:01.279 after the gym like that's when all the  <br>00:33:02.480 growth occurs that's actually when it  <br>00:33:03.840 just starts to go up it's four days  <br>00:33:06.480 afterwards so if you train twice a week  <br>00:33:08.559 you train on Monday you're going a lot  <br>00:33:10.039 of muscle on Monday night Tuesday and  <br>00:33:12.080 Wednesday back uh towards the end of  <br>00:33:14.000 Wednesday you're just not really growing  <br>00:33:15.279 much more muscle you go back to the gym  <br>00:33:17.320 Thursday you hit it hard again you hit  <br>00:33:19.320 that curve up by Sunday you're totally  <br>00:33:21.519 relaxed during Sunday you're not growing  <br>00:33:24.159 any muscle your body's really recovering  <br>00:33:26.039 a lot of that fatigue and then by Monday  <br>00:33:28.159 you're fresh as a pickle and you're  <br>00:33:29.360 ready to go at it again how long will it  <br>00:33:31.600 take me to lose the muscles that I've  <br>00:33:33.320 gained if I don't go back to the gym so  <br>00:33:35.200 again focusing on this bicep I train it  <br>00:33:37.600 I do two times a week I get it nice and  <br>00:33:39.559 big how long before it  <br>00:33:42.559 vanishes great question two-part  <br>00:33:45.919 answer part one  <br>00:33:49.159 is within about two weeks of not  <br>00:33:52.039 training  <br>00:33:53.120 it the first reduction in muscle that is  <br>00:33:57.240 detected by Modern Machinery occurs so  <br>00:34:00.679 if you don't lift for 2 weeks and we put  <br>00:34:03.679 you in an MRI scanner or a dexa scanner  <br>00:34:06.279 let's say a week and a half you don't  <br>00:34:07.440 lift I can't tell you're not really  <br>00:34:10.119 losing any muscle yet you're just going  <br>00:34:11.879 insane and so me personally I'm like  <br>00:34:13.839 addicted to lifting so if I don't lift  <br>00:34:15.159 for a week I'm like oh my God oh my God  <br>00:34:16.599 all my muscle's gone there is some kind  <br>00:34:18.760 of intuitive truth to that because when  <br>00:34:21.040 you don't stress your muscles they when  <br>00:34:23.440 you do stress your muscles they get a  <br>00:34:25.280 little bit inflamed and they bulge up a  <br>00:34:27.399 little bit B so when you're not training  <br>00:34:29.440 for half a week to a week your muscles  <br>00:34:32.560 look smaller like they've lost weight  <br>00:34:34.280 but it's really just all water that they  <br>00:34:35.560 lost you do one gym session thinking  <br>00:34:38.399 like oh my God my biceps are gone a week  <br>00:34:40.000 and a half later you do one session at  <br>00:34:42.079 the end of that you flex and you're like  <br>00:34:43.320 oh my God I'm the biggest I've ever been  <br>00:34:45.159 I was just delusional that whole time CU  <br>00:34:47.079 that stuff comes back super quick after  <br>00:34:49.560 about two weeks of not lifting you start  <br>00:34:51.760 to lose muscle but it happens really  <br>00:34:53.839 really slowly and takes weeks and weeks  <br>00:34:55.918 and weeks and weeks after for several  <br>00:34:58.200 months of not lifting you're going to  <br>00:34:59.920 look considerably smaller in your biceps  <br>00:35:02.839 but probably not as small as when you  <br>00:35:04.960 started lifting because your muscles  <br>00:35:06.960 have a certain memory if we can call it  <br>00:35:08.920 that is that true that thing oh yeah and  <br>00:35:12.200 so a lot of times when you gain an  <br>00:35:13.760 initial amount of muscle especially if  <br>00:35:15.280 you've been at it for years it just  <br>00:35:17.359 never goes back to the same size as when  <br>00:35:19.079 you started it's just always going to be  <br>00:35:20.920 bigger until you reach your 80s or  <br>00:35:22.960 something like that that being said yes  <br>00:35:26.599 you will notice reductions size so two  <br>00:35:28.440 weeks is the direct answer there and  <br>00:35:30.599 it's going to take weeks and weeks and  <br>00:35:31.960 months and months to recede however  <br>00:35:33.520 here's part two and this is awesome news  <br>00:35:36.480 because of that muscle memory  <br>00:35:38.720 situation however long it took you to  <br>00:35:41.079 gain the muscles  <br>00:35:42.839 initially it's going to take you an  <br>00:35:45.839 order of magnitude a factor of 10ish or  <br>00:35:48.760 so less time to get it back if you've  <br>00:35:51.960 been more jacked before if you've had  <br>00:35:53.880 bigger muscles they come back to their  <br>00:35:56.680 old size  <br>00:35:58.160 if it took if you you you lifted for  <br>00:36:00.240 eight months you got a bigger bicep and  <br>00:36:03.119 you stopped Lifting for three months and  <br>00:36:04.520 it looks about the same as when you  <br>00:36:06.000 started if you're really careful like  <br>00:36:07.200 okay it's a little bit bigger but really  <br>00:36:08.440 it's just back to square one most people  <br>00:36:10.560 think oh my God another eight months  <br>00:36:13.480 just to get back to where I started like  <br>00:36:15.079 forget the gym the truth is after  <br>00:36:18.000 roughly about a month maybe as little as  <br>00:36:20.599 3 weeks you're going to have the same  <br>00:36:22.240 size biceps that you did in your Peak  <br>00:36:24.400 because the degree to which your tissue  <br>00:36:26.920 grows if it's been a certain size before  <br>00:36:29.079 especially if it was notably bigger than  <br>00:36:31.760 normal and you held that around for a  <br>00:36:33.720 few months and a few years it comes back  <br>00:36:37.160 in a way that is so fast If you  <br>00:36:39.680 experience If you experience it yourself  <br>00:36:42.160 it's it's like you don't believe that  <br>00:36:44.000 it's happening to you you they been able  <br>00:36:46.240 to like scientifically test this oh yeah  <br>00:36:48.319 all the time yeah retraining studies  <br>00:36:49.839 detraining retraining oh yeah they've  <br>00:36:51.680 they've done studies where they  <br>00:36:52.800 purposefully like lift for a while and  <br>00:36:54.560 they stop Lifting for a long time and  <br>00:36:55.920 they see how long it takes to get back  <br>00:36:57.319 and  <br>00:36:58.160 um there's one study I'm familiar with  <br>00:37:00.440 offand that there's a group of people  <br>00:37:02.640 that trained consistently for multiple  <br>00:37:05.119 weeks and there's another group of  <br>00:37:07.400 people that trained consistently for a  <br>00:37:09.319 few weeks and then took two weeks  <br>00:37:11.200 completely off in the middle and then  <br>00:37:12.880 just started retraining again for a few  <br>00:37:14.359 weeks later both groups had identically  <br>00:37:17.680 sized differences in muscle at the end  <br>00:37:19.680 of the study and so we were like okay so  <br>00:37:21.680 so that group that trained consistently  <br>00:37:23.280 never took two weeks off could we say  <br>00:37:25.839 that they purposefully like dunked two  <br>00:37:28.359 weeks of their time away for nothing  <br>00:37:30.599 uhhuh yeah your body goes right back  <br>00:37:33.839 into regaining old lost muscle so  <br>00:37:36.880 rapidly that this is such great news  <br>00:37:39.960 because look let's say you lifted  <br>00:37:41.839 consistently most of the Year holiday  <br>00:37:43.880 season comes up Winter  <br>00:37:45.520 holidays you're not going to the gym as  <br>00:37:47.920 much maybe not at all three weeks later  <br>00:37:50.240 of no gym you look at yourself you look  <br>00:37:52.040 a little small or kind of deflated and  <br>00:37:53.560 you're like oh my God I'm going to have  <br>00:37:55.760 to restart all this from scrap  <br>00:37:58.079 nope two weeks later you're in the best  <br>00:38:00.640 shape of your life again if you left the  <br>00:38:02.720 gym for 6 months one or two months later  <br>00:38:05.680 you're in the best shape of your life  <br>00:38:06.920 again that's how rapidly it comes back  <br>00:38:08.720 so it's really good news for anyone who  <br>00:38:09.960 hasn't been in the gym and is feeling  <br>00:38:11.119 guilty about it go back get consistent  <br>00:38:13.280 again you're just going to Skyrocket  <br>00:38:15.839 that is very exciting because yeah we  <br>00:38:17.880 always have sometimes it's the trough  <br>00:38:19.960 the the couple of weeks off that makes  <br>00:38:21.480 us demotivated cuz that's crossed my  <br>00:38:23.400 mind before Oh my God that took me three  <br>00:38:24.839 months to get there and it's going to  <br>00:38:26.599 take me another 3 months to get back but  <br>00:38:28.920 what about so if I'm training that bicep  <br>00:38:31.240 how have I got to think about stretching  <br>00:38:33.560 and warming up before I start before I  <br>00:38:36.040 get going with my training there are  <br>00:38:38.079 many ways to do it but uh there's some  <br>00:38:41.040 research on this recently  <br>00:38:43.000 actually you don't need much one of the  <br>00:38:46.560 simplest ways to warm up that we  <br>00:38:48.520 recommended RP and our app has it in the  <br>00:38:50.760 in the  <br>00:38:52.280 instructions you want let's say you have  <br>00:38:54.480 your final weight already picked out  <br>00:38:56.640 like last week did 20 lb dumbbells for  <br>00:38:59.680 sets of 15 this week it's sets of 16  <br>00:39:02.240 with the 20 lb dumbbells what you want  <br>00:39:04.359 to do is you want to do very lightweight  <br>00:39:08.680 maybe the 5B dumbbells for a set of 12  <br>00:39:12.079 just to get everything moving and  <br>00:39:13.160 grooving good technique same technique  <br>00:39:14.599 you're going to  <br>00:39:15.640 use 30 seconds of rest a minute of rest  <br>00:39:19.359 you pick up  <br>00:39:21.880 the 10 or 15 PB dumbbells you do a set  <br>00:39:25.000 of eight reps there a little bit more  <br>00:39:26.640 challenging your feel your grooove a  <br>00:39:28.040 little bit but your body is already more  <br>00:39:29.240 warm your nervous system is more active  <br>00:39:30.800 your muscles are more  <br>00:39:32.319 pliable you rest a minute after that and  <br>00:39:36.119 then you'll pick up the weight you're  <br>00:39:37.400 actually using the 20 Pounders and  <br>00:39:39.800 you'll do a set of two to four reps with  <br>00:39:41.599 them just to get the feel of that heavy  <br>00:39:43.520 weight that you're going to be doing to  <br>00:39:44.880 climatize not just your muscles and your  <br>00:39:46.839 nervous system but your psychology to  <br>00:39:48.359 like okay this is this is the business  <br>00:39:49.640 weight that I'm going to be using so 12  <br>00:39:52.560 84 rest another 30 seconds first working  <br>00:39:56.040 set of whatever 6 reps you're up when  <br>00:40:00.079 you have multiple exercises for the same  <br>00:40:01.800 muscle group you just need to do one set  <br>00:40:04.560 of like four to eight reps in that  <br>00:40:07.240 middle weight range between zero and  <br>00:40:09.200 whatever you're going to do just to get  <br>00:40:10.800 the feel of the exercise because you're  <br>00:40:12.079 already generally warm in that area one  <br>00:40:14.520 little warmup set rest uh you know 30  <br>00:40:16.720 seconds to a minute and then hit your  <br>00:40:18.000 first set if you're switching which  <br>00:40:20.319 muscles you're using like you were  <br>00:40:21.520 training chest but then in the same  <br>00:40:22.839 session you started training back that  <br>00:40:24.880 first back exercise 1284 the weight goes  <br>00:40:28.079 up up up the Reps go down down down just  <br>00:40:30.200 a little bit of time between and then  <br>00:40:31.800 you hit your first work set you're good  <br>00:40:32.960 to go you don't have to do cardio before  <br>00:40:35.280 you don't have to get on the treadmill  <br>00:40:36.319 you can if you like it you don't have to  <br>00:40:38.079 do some kind of cardio warm-up you don't  <br>00:40:40.000 have to do any kind of stretching or  <br>00:40:41.280 anything like that you don't have to do  <br>00:40:42.560 any kind of weird bosu ball band around  <br>00:40:44.440 your neck crazy potentiation exercises  <br>00:40:47.119 just that little ramp up is basically  <br>00:40:50.119 98% of all cases exactly and only what  <br>00:40:52.760 you need to do what is a warm-up what is  <br>00:40:55.119 going on physiologically inside my  <br>00:40:56.640 muscle cuz we we all just warm up and I  <br>00:40:58.640 don't think anybody actually knows what  <br>00:41:00.000 what's going on yeah so your muscle  <br>00:41:04.079 tissues um they have uh they have  <br>00:41:08.440 physical qualities that can be measured  <br>00:41:10.200 almost in like a fluid dynamics terms  <br>00:41:12.119 like viscosity and hysteresis and all  <br>00:41:14.560 that stuff and so when you're very cold  <br>00:41:19.920 a lot of times the uh there's kind of a  <br>00:41:23.200 Frailty implied there as you're warming  <br>00:41:26.359 up you're sending blood to around the  <br>00:41:28.920 muscle the muscle itself is literally  <br>00:41:30.920 becoming warmer and a lot of those kind  <br>00:41:34.200 of tight structures that are uh they  <br>00:41:36.800 proteins that are made of kind of a  <br>00:41:38.040 stretchy material they loosen up a  <br>00:41:39.680 little bit and that allows you to go  <br>00:41:43.880 through that full range of motion and  <br>00:41:45.079 training and not actually get hurt and  <br>00:41:48.520 that's from the muscle perspective you  <br>00:41:50.720 also get some kind of chemical stuff  <br>00:41:52.280 that happens and certain structures fill  <br>00:41:53.839 up with chemicals certain structures  <br>00:41:55.480 chemicals go down and that gets you  <br>00:41:56.880 ready to perform super hard work but  <br>00:41:59.960 that's part of the story the other part  <br>00:42:01.160 is the nervous system because your  <br>00:42:03.440 nervous system is also getting warmed up  <br>00:42:05.200 and in technical terms it's called  <br>00:42:07.280 potentiation when you just show up to  <br>00:42:10.359 the gym and you let's say we said look  <br>00:42:13.359 okay we re-engineered your tendons when  <br>00:42:15.000 you were asleep you're not going to get  <br>00:42:16.720 hurt it's impossible for you to get hurt  <br>00:42:18.079 like a car would have to hit you for you  <br>00:42:19.280 to rip your bicep off you can just go  <br>00:42:21.520 and just hit the curls right away you  <br>00:42:23.680 wouldn't get hurt but it would feel  <br>00:42:25.480 really strange and you wouldn't get four  <br>00:42:27.680 or five reps close to where you're  <br>00:42:29.440 supposed to be from last week because  <br>00:42:31.319 your nervous system was like what hell  <br>00:42:33.559 is going on I'm supposed to be doing  <br>00:42:35.359 something so you need warm up the  <br>00:42:36.319 nervous system a part of that is  <br>00:42:38.119 literally like the actual nervous system  <br>00:42:39.800 itself down to the C Level is Flushing  <br>00:42:42.280 all kinds of metabolites through the  <br>00:42:43.680 connections are getting stronger you're  <br>00:42:45.920 uh sort of doing a little bit of kind of  <br>00:42:47.319 mini rewiring of primary motor cortex to  <br>00:42:50.200 say go oh we're doing curls this is how  <br>00:42:52.599 you execute this pattern another part is  <br>00:42:55.119 technical like oh this is the technique  <br>00:42:57.480 I'm going to do because if you just get  <br>00:42:58.960 in the muscle and just do stuff like  <br>00:43:00.920 imagine if I told you like hey here's a  <br>00:43:02.280 ball just like go go shoot some hoops  <br>00:43:04.040 just hit that you know three-pointer  <br>00:43:05.640 shot you're  <br>00:43:06.720 like I need a couple shots to remind my  <br>00:43:09.880 body of what it's like to shoot the  <br>00:43:11.720 basketball same idea for lifting you to  <br>00:43:13.880 remind your body of what a curl motion  <br>00:43:15.640 is and if you remind it a couple sets in  <br>00:43:17.520 a row by the time you hit that real  <br>00:43:19.400 working set that fourth set your body's  <br>00:43:21.559 like I know exactly what I'm going to do  <br>00:43:24.160 which parts of the muscle I'm going to  <br>00:43:26.119 activate to contract which other parts  <br>00:43:28.079 of other muscles am going to activate to  <br>00:43:29.680 relax and co-contract to make this whole  <br>00:43:31.680 thing happen what are the the other sort  <br>00:43:33.800 of common mistakes people make when they  <br>00:43:35.920 they go to the gym or they start  <br>00:43:36.960 training or they start exercising so  <br>00:43:38.839 there I've I've kind of ticked off not  <br>00:43:41.240 stretching and taking on a heavy load  <br>00:43:43.960 too quickly um but also ramping up  <br>00:43:46.920 volumes and loads too fast so that sort  <br>00:43:49.200 of over strained before my body is ready  <br>00:43:50.920 for it are there any really other sort  <br>00:43:52.960 of common obvious mistakes people make  <br>00:43:55.200 that inhibit their progress  <br>00:43:58.240 one of them is a failure to pay  <br>00:44:00.839 attention to good technique okay there  <br>00:44:04.040 are sort of some Universal principles of  <br>00:44:05.880 what is good technique in the gym for  <br>00:44:07.359 muscle  <br>00:44:08.280 growth one of them is are you moving in  <br>00:44:11.720 a way that properly activates stimulates  <br>00:44:14.880 that muscle to actually get it to grow  <br>00:44:17.800 because if you do a curl that arcs up it  <br>00:44:22.040 does a lot of bicep if you do a curl  <br>00:44:24.280 that arcs back this way because the  <br>00:44:26.440 bicep is being pulled one way and pulled  <br>00:44:28.839 the other way at the shoulder and the  <br>00:44:30.720 elbow it ends up doing more of um  <br>00:44:33.480 stabilizing contraction than actually  <br>00:44:35.760 being the prime mover for the movement  <br>00:44:37.960 so when you see people curling at the  <br>00:44:39.240 gym and they're just kind of doing this  <br>00:44:40.400 you're like yes that is training your  <br>00:44:43.119 biceps but if you just moved a little  <br>00:44:45.839 bit differently it would be so so much  <br>00:44:47.400 better here's another example squatting  <br>00:44:49.319 right for your legs if you squat really  <br>00:44:52.760 far back and not so far down like you're  <br>00:44:57.040 your glutes get hit okay your lower back  <br>00:44:59.280 and upper and midback is going to get  <br>00:45:00.920 hit a lot but because there's not a huge  <br>00:45:03.559 change in your knee angle you're not  <br>00:45:06.119 getting a ton of quad stimulus if you  <br>00:45:08.160 stay more upright and your heels and  <br>00:45:10.880 toes are on the ground and you allow  <br>00:45:13.240 your knees to go Way Forward beyond your  <br>00:45:15.880 toes as you stay upright and sink down  <br>00:45:18.520 really low so that your knee goes into  <br>00:45:19.960 one of these oh my God it's all quads  <br>00:45:23.000 all day long so you want technique that  <br>00:45:25.520 is targeting the muscle it's very  <br>00:45:27.720 similar rep to rep to rep and it puts  <br>00:45:30.400 the muscle consistently through a range  <br>00:45:32.720 of motion that is in that deep painful  <br>00:45:35.640 uh length and stretch position if you  <br>00:45:37.760 just have all those three everything  <br>00:45:39.480 else we can say about your Technique is  <br>00:45:41.079 just nuances and finer points those are  <br>00:45:43.079 really the big ones we talked about  <br>00:45:45.000 nutrition earlier as well so if I want  <br>00:45:46.920 to make my bicep grow and also drop off  <br>00:45:50.720 the weight around the bicep so you can  <br>00:45:52.520 see see it even more what should I be  <br>00:45:54.440 putting into my  <br>00:45:55.599 mouth the number one requisite for  <br>00:45:58.160 muscle growth is  <br>00:46:00.160 protein foods with lots of protein in  <br>00:46:04.079 them ideally should be consumed three to  <br>00:46:07.400 five times per day at roughly  <br>00:46:09.640 equidistant intervals breakfast lunch  <br>00:46:12.319 dinner totally fine even better  <br>00:46:14.440 breakfast lunch dinner evening  <br>00:46:17.000 snack the average person  <br>00:46:20.240 needs a little bit less than let's say a  <br>00:46:24.359 gram per pound of body weight per day of  <br>00:46:26.480 protein actually considerably less  <br>00:46:28.559 that's kind of the top limit and a cool  <br>00:46:30.559 aspirational thing to shoot for so if  <br>00:46:33.720 you weigh let's say 200 lb you should be  <br>00:46:37.200 consuming something like 150 to 200  <br>00:46:39.599 grams of protein per day and 150 for  <br>00:46:41.640 almost everyone's totally enough but if  <br>00:46:43.520 you're real serious and hardcore and  <br>00:46:45.119 just want that insurance policy 200  <br>00:46:46.680 grams of protein per day so then if  <br>00:46:48.680 you're eating four times a day that's oh  <br>00:46:51.160 yeah 30 40 let's say 40 to 50 grams of  <br>00:46:55.200 protein per meal can I eat too much  <br>00:46:57.800 protein and and then it becomes fat or  <br>00:47:00.359 something uh that's uh so protein by  <br>00:47:03.319 itself no if your protein is so high  <br>00:47:06.040 that your carbs and fats are the same  <br>00:47:08.160 and you jack up your protein super high  <br>00:47:09.720 but your carbs and fats stay where they  <br>00:47:11.440 are your calories become excessive that  <br>00:47:14.040 will cause fing over time but if you're  <br>00:47:16.119 doing a diet where you take a ton of  <br>00:47:17.640 protein but you dropped your carbs and  <br>00:47:19.119 fats and your calories are at  <br>00:47:20.559 maintenance levels you're not going to  <br>00:47:21.880 gain any fat it's not bad for your  <br>00:47:23.839 kidneys it's not bad for any other part  <br>00:47:25.520 of your body excessive protein as a  <br>00:47:28.559 health malady has been a myth the entire  <br>00:47:31.000 time and that's one of those um Notions  <br>00:47:33.280 that people carry with them that too  <br>00:47:35.000 much protein is bad right like yes if  <br>00:47:36.559 you've had kidney surgery absolutely  <br>00:47:38.359 short of that you're probably good to go  <br>00:47:40.640 you'll fart a lot and people will hate  <br>00:47:42.119 you but you know you mentioned three to  <br>00:47:44.800 five meals a  <br>00:47:46.040 day a lot of people are now in this Camp  <br>00:47:48.760 of of fasting an intermittent fasting  <br>00:47:51.720 and not eating often is it possible to  <br>00:47:53.839 fast but also to gain muscle mass in the  <br>00:47:56.200 way that you've described yeah totally  <br>00:47:58.000 it just won't happen at as an impressive  <br>00:47:59.920 rate so you have to make a trade-off for  <br>00:48:01.599 yourself if you want you know most  <br>00:48:03.839 jacked Steven that you can be three to  <br>00:48:05.720 five meals a day consistently spread in  <br>00:48:07.880 almost to an  <br>00:48:09.839 individual competitive bodybuilders eat  <br>00:48:13.720 that frequently and eat high protein how  <br>00:48:16.160 often did you eat uh I eat five five  <br>00:48:18.599 times a day four or five times a day  <br>00:48:20.079 usually and do you eat before or after  <br>00:48:22.040 you train both okay so before you train  <br>00:48:24.720 and after you train do you different  <br>00:48:26.160 things a times I'll train early in the  <br>00:48:27.920 morning and so I won't train at I won't  <br>00:48:29.640 eat at all I'll wake up and I'll have  <br>00:48:31.559 like a protein and carb mix shake with  <br>00:48:33.400 my training totally optional super extra  <br>00:48:36.079 credit may not do anything at all if you  <br>00:48:38.200 look at the literature but I find it a  <br>00:48:40.000 little bit compelling to do a little bit  <br>00:48:41.240 of that and then afterwards I have my  <br>00:48:43.200 first post-workout meal second meal  <br>00:48:45.119 third meal fourth meal bedtime wake up  <br>00:48:47.040 do it again what you take to get you  <br>00:48:49.280 going do you do pre-workout no why no uh  <br>00:48:51.920 I don't do any stimulants of any kind  <br>00:48:54.040 why uh I'm just kind of coked up all the  <br>00:48:56.960 time naturally so like if you give me  <br>00:48:59.280 stimulants it's just going to go into  <br>00:49:01.040 the not so pleasant side of side effects  <br>00:49:03.319 like I'm just going to be like this and  <br>00:49:04.960 way too amped up super high anxiety and  <br>00:49:07.640 my thoughts get to be like I have less  <br>00:49:09.440 fluidity of thinking and stuff so I just  <br>00:49:11.799 it just a lot of me I guess and so when  <br>00:49:14.079 I wake up in the morning I don't need  <br>00:49:15.520 anything to get me going I just go and a  <br>00:49:17.680 couple warm-up sets later I have all the  <br>00:49:19.319 energy I need that's not everyone and so  <br>00:49:22.559 some green tea some black coffee or some  <br>00:49:24.920 pre-workout 30 minutes before the the  <br>00:49:26.880 gym is great advice for a ton of people  <br>00:49:28.839 I feel like pre-workout can't be healthy  <br>00:49:30.799 if you're doing it five six seven times  <br>00:49:32.799 a week because some of that stuff is so  <br>00:49:34.799 unbelievably strong like I've had it  <br>00:49:36.720 before I've got literally like heart  <br>00:49:37.839 palpitations when I've had a pre-workout  <br>00:49:39.400 and you know you talk about anxiety that  <br>00:49:41.200 anxious feeling it can't be it can't be  <br>00:49:43.640 help healthy for people to be doing that  <br>00:49:46.200 frequently it seems to be quite fine it  <br>00:49:49.079 seems to be quite fine now at the  <br>00:49:50.839 extremes and in for some individuals  <br>00:49:53.440 it's not ideal but um the upper limit  <br>00:49:57.400 dose of caffeine in milligrams per day  <br>00:50:01.520 at which we can confidently say most  <br>00:50:03.400 people will experience the beginnings of  <br>00:50:06.000 Health  <br>00:50:07.000 maladies is a th000  <br>00:50:09.760 milligrams and a cup of coffee has  <br>00:50:12.440 depending on which cup 50 to 100 now  <br>00:50:15.440 some pre-workouts have 250 gr milligrams  <br>00:50:18.799 of caffeine some have  <br>00:50:21.160 500 uh last I checked Ronnie Coleman's  <br>00:50:24.280 pre-workout has 550 migs of caffeine per  <br>00:50:27.720 scoop or per serving and so that's kind  <br>00:50:30.119 of a lot uh I if I took 550 migs of  <br>00:50:33.640 caffeine you don't take me to the gym  <br>00:50:35.720 just take me right to the hospital put  <br>00:50:37.400 me in the psychiatric word 36 hours  <br>00:50:39.440 later I'll be okay but for some people  <br>00:50:41.799 to get so accustomed to high doses of  <br>00:50:43.440 caffeine that is supposed not unhealthy  <br>00:50:45.240 for them to consume and also uh they  <br>00:50:47.760 feel quite fine so I would say start  <br>00:50:49.599 with as little as you need to get you  <br>00:50:51.160 going and if you need to tight trate and  <br>00:50:52.640 work up from there that's a good thing  <br>00:50:54.760 the other thing I would say is I would  <br>00:50:57.200 have a compelling case for pre-workout  <br>00:50:59.559 or stimulant if I ask you like hey how  <br>00:51:02.400 much energy do you typically have at the  <br>00:51:03.640 gym you're like well that's super great  <br>00:51:05.599 and they're like should I take  <br>00:51:06.520 pre-workout I'd be like no there's no  <br>00:51:08.240 compelling case for that at all if  <br>00:51:09.920 you're like look I wake up in the  <br>00:51:10.839 morning some days I just don't get a ton  <br>00:51:12.599 of sleep and I need something to get me  <br>00:51:14.920 going not every day but sometimes I'll  <br>00:51:16.799 be like hey look consider green tea  <br>00:51:19.680 black coffee some diet soda or all the  <br>00:51:22.920 way up to pre-workout if you need it but  <br>00:51:25.440 some people take it kind of a like um a  <br>00:51:28.319 like a religious thing as a habit uh as  <br>00:51:31.160 a ritual and it's like dude you're  <br>00:51:33.240 training your forms and biceps for 20  <br>00:51:36.000 minutes total at 900 p.m. you do not  <br>00:51:38.599 need three scoops of pre-workout for  <br>00:51:40.440 that I don't even know where it's going  <br>00:51:42.000 at that point so some people get a  <br>00:51:43.280 little crazy with the pre-workouts at  <br>00:51:44.839 the end of the world it's at at best  <br>00:51:48.839 needless what's your stance on the whole  <br>00:51:50.960 idea of calories in calories out a lot  <br>00:51:53.359 of people just focus on that as their  <br>00:51:55.520 their sort of their script to lose body  <br>00:51:59.359 weight lose body fat and gain muscle is  <br>00:52:02.640 is that a useful frame to to use and why  <br>00:52:05.839 do so many people fail at it if if it is  <br>00:52:08.319 a useful frame most people fail at it  <br>00:52:11.240 because they don't consider both the  <br>00:52:13.440 calories in and calories outside of the  <br>00:52:16.559 equation and a lot of people fail  <br>00:52:18.920 because they're very bad at estimating  <br>00:52:20.680 food amounts and calories they someone  <br>00:52:23.359 will say like a tablespoon of peanut  <br>00:52:25.000 butter Stephen if you ever actually seen  <br>00:52:27.119 a tablespoon measuring cup it does not  <br>00:52:30.200 look like Mom's tablespoon where she  <br>00:52:32.119 takes the peanut butter and goes that's  <br>00:52:34.640 like four tablespoons and so like but  <br>00:52:36.720 I'm eating the calories blah blah blah  <br>00:52:39.599 every time you take people into what's  <br>00:52:41.319 called a metabolic Ward which is a study  <br>00:52:44.040 center where you're not allowed to have  <br>00:52:45.880 visitors that bring you food the workers  <br>00:52:48.240 only give you the food that you need and  <br>00:52:49.760 all of your exercise and your output is  <br>00:52:51.720 controlled and monitored and so is your  <br>00:52:53.359 intake no one has ever violated laws of  <br>00:52:55.960 thermodynamic we give you a certain  <br>00:52:57.440 number of calories and we expect you to  <br>00:52:58.760 lose a certain number of weight there's  <br>00:52:59.799 a variance about that but it you're  <br>00:53:02.720 going to lose the weight that roughly we  <br>00:53:04.520 predict if we account for all variables  <br>00:53:05.880 you're going to lose almost exactly the  <br>00:53:07.040 weight that we predict so calories in  <br>00:53:08.240 calories out is incontrovertible in  <br>00:53:10.599 among 90s something per 98% of people  <br>00:53:15.000 who do research in the field and are  <br>00:53:16.359 scientifically literate and educated  <br>00:53:18.160 calories in calories out is not  <br>00:53:19.640 controversial it never has been there  <br>00:53:21.559 are some people who say well calorie  <br>00:53:24.400 counting didn't work for me that's  <br>00:53:26.920 probably because you did it wrong or you  <br>00:53:29.000 weren't even concerned about how much  <br>00:53:30.400 protein you're taking in or how many  <br>00:53:31.640 carbs or how many fats there are other  <br>00:53:33.040 details that matter like if you say I  <br>00:53:36.880 need a V8 engine in a car that's all  <br>00:53:38.760 that matters like okay well there's no  <br>00:53:40.240 steering wheel there's no pedals cool  <br>00:53:42.160 well okay I need those things too so  <br>00:53:44.200 calories and calories out is the very  <br>00:53:45.839 core because without an engine you're  <br>00:53:46.920 not going anywhere but what types of  <br>00:53:50.119 foods you're eating matters a little bit  <br>00:53:52.200 are you getting enough protein carbs  <br>00:53:53.480 fats that matters a bit too so people  <br>00:53:55.319 like to just bash calorie balance and  <br>00:53:58.040 calories in calories out is well it's  <br>00:53:59.559 it's totally myth it doesn't work no no  <br>00:54:01.000 it works great it's just not always  <br>00:54:03.400 enough to get you in the best shape you  <br>00:54:04.760 can but if you do it right as far as net  <br>00:54:07.400 balance weight gain or weight loss  <br>00:54:09.720 calories in calories out is actually the  <br>00:54:11.520 only thing that matters tissue wise is  <br>00:54:14.760 that gain mostly muscle or mostly fat is  <br>00:54:17.160 the loss mostly muscle or mostly fat  <br>00:54:19.079 that has not so much to do with calories  <br>00:54:20.760 it has much more to do with proteins  <br>00:54:22.799 carbs fats the quality of food you're  <br>00:54:24.680 eating nutrient timing and all the rest  <br>00:54:26.440 of it so calories and calories out is  <br>00:54:27.680 amazing super explanatory critical but  <br>00:54:30.359 it's just not the whole picture and  <br>00:54:32.319 that's really it I guess because so many  <br>00:54:33.680 people say they've heard about calories  <br>00:54:35.319 and calories out but they fail at  <br>00:54:38.480 maintaining it now that's really about  <br>00:54:40.599 motivation and the psychology of doing  <br>00:54:42.200 such a thing um some people have said to  <br>00:54:44.079 me that our bodies want to defend our  <br>00:54:45.559 weight so if we start eating less we'll  <br>00:54:47.720 become a little bit more hungry if we go  <br>00:54:49.040 for a run after the run or after  <br>00:54:51.119 physical exertion our body will try and  <br>00:54:52.760 make up for it because it's programmed  <br>00:54:54.079 to try and defend its weight because its  <br>00:54:55.960 weight cor relates to our ability to  <br>00:54:58.520 survive  <br>00:55:00.119 um why do people fail at it one of the  <br>00:55:02.680 reasons you said is because you know  <br>00:55:04.160 that they're not actually measuring the  <br>00:55:05.440 calories correctly but the psychological  <br>00:55:07.480 reasons that it isn't hasn't worked for  <br>00:55:10.000 some people can you think of many  <br>00:55:12.359 because when I when people talk about  <br>00:55:13.440 calories in calories out if you look at  <br>00:55:15.000 the comment sections on those videos  <br>00:55:16.240 people say I've tried this and it didn't  <br>00:55:17.319 work okay so first of all I typically  <br>00:55:20.160 don't look at comment sections of videos  <br>00:55:21.760 because comment section is not  <br>00:55:23.520 representative of the population it's  <br>00:55:25.720 not represent reprentative of the people  <br>00:55:27.480 that watch your videos it's not  <br>00:55:28.799 representative of the hardcore  <br>00:55:30.000 demographic that watches your videos so  <br>00:55:32.640 just as a statistical artifact every  <br>00:55:35.000 single Claim by people against calorie  <br>00:55:37.520 balance in that comment section could be  <br>00:55:40.000 true for them but they represent 1% of  <br>00:55:42.599 the population so 99% of people at works  <br>00:55:44.920 just fine for 1% they get into some kind  <br>00:55:47.119 of trouble usually that trouble is they  <br>00:55:49.440 didn't count calories properly they  <br>00:55:51.480 didn't account for macronutrient profile  <br>00:55:53.280 proteins carbs fats they didn't account  <br>00:55:54.680 for nutrient timing or the kinds of food  <br>00:55:56.480 that they're they're doing and so on and  <br>00:55:57.680 so forth and another one is like you  <br>00:56:00.559 said  <br>00:56:01.799 sustainability how long do I have to  <br>00:56:04.200 count calories for in my life for me to  <br>00:56:06.920 get the body that I want and keep it is  <br>00:56:08.799 sure [ __ ] not going to be forever so  <br>00:56:10.520 what I'll do is I'll count calories for  <br>00:56:11.880 a few months I'll lose a lot of weight  <br>00:56:13.400 then I'll go back to eating on Vibes and  <br>00:56:14.960 the weight comes right back absolutely  <br>00:56:17.039 so better than just counting calories  <br>00:56:19.559 what we want to do is instill people  <br>00:56:21.200 with good eating habits if you learn how  <br>00:56:23.400 to construct meals made of lean proteins  <br>00:56:25.760 veggies fruits whole grains healthy fats  <br>00:56:28.200 you know roughly how to see how much  <br>00:56:30.000 food you need and how much food looks at  <br>00:56:32.039 least like it's what you eat per day if  <br>00:56:33.839 you're checking your body weight  <br>00:56:35.000 relatively often and when your body  <br>00:56:37.039 weight starts to get a little higher you  <br>00:56:38.319 kind of clean up your diet a little bit  <br>00:56:40.039 uh and when your body weight's nice and  <br>00:56:41.240 low you couple cheat meals couple kebabs  <br>00:56:43.680 you know burgers and stuff that's all  <br>00:56:45.359 good if you do that and you have those  <br>00:56:46.640 healthy habits whatever weight you lost  <br>00:56:48.400 on calorie restriction you can maintain  <br>00:56:50.920 with very very little work not counting  <br>00:56:53.839 a damn thing just on good habits but but  <br>00:56:56.799 if you counted calories you do some  <br>00:56:58.559 weird diet where you only eat like too  <br>00:57:00.200 with orange slices and protein shakes or  <br>00:57:02.280 something yeah the calorie counting will  <br>00:57:04.319 get you wherever you need to go but then  <br>00:57:06.160 afterwards like the diet's over and  <br>00:57:07.480 you're like now what do I do like uh  <br>00:57:10.200 good luck going out in the world and  <br>00:57:11.799 feating the same diet that got you fat  <br>00:57:13.559 in the first place that's the big kicker  <br>00:57:15.880 people might say it takes too much time  <br>00:57:17.880 to count calories it leads to a an  <br>00:57:20.599 unhealthy relationship with food I think  <br>00:57:22.640 there's a big movement at the moment to  <br>00:57:23.799 trying to get calories off menus because  <br>00:57:25.839 it's said to increase the amount of  <br>00:57:27.799 people that have eating disorders and  <br>00:57:28.920 things like  <br>00:57:30.799 that is that a a conversation worth  <br>00:57:34.799 entertaining in this in this regard sure  <br>00:57:36.839 sure very few people will develop Eating  <br>00:57:40.880 Disorders based on increases in  <br>00:57:43.079 information they are presented I would  <br>00:57:45.559 actually call that eating order instead  <br>00:57:47.039 of eating  <br>00:57:48.400 disorder most people who get Eating  <br>00:57:50.440 Disorders are highly at risk genetically  <br>00:57:53.119 and with a few other social  <br>00:57:55.000 circumstances  <br>00:57:57.280 Eating Disorders are uh for example the  <br>00:58:00.799 most uh deleterious Eating Disorders  <br>00:58:04.039 anorexia  <br>00:58:05.640 nervosa seen not exclusively but almost  <br>00:58:09.559 exclusively in females of reproductive  <br>00:58:12.000 age they ain't calories on a menu doing  <br>00:58:14.839 that that's something you bring into the  <br>00:58:17.359 table usually because you have the  <br>00:58:19.440 genetic proclivity for it and  <br>00:58:21.880 additionally because you've been in a  <br>00:58:24.119 social and cultural circumstance where  <br>00:58:27.079 not only were you the wrong person to  <br>00:58:28.920 get ridiculed for your weight but also a  <br>00:58:31.839 lot of people ridiculed you for your  <br>00:58:33.319 weight and then you go all careening off  <br>00:58:35.839 on this path where no one can even tell  <br>00:58:37.520 you're super skinny anymore because you  <br>00:58:38.760 don't believe it so the idea that uh  <br>00:58:42.200 you're going to see much higher  <br>00:58:43.200 prevalence globally in Eating Disorders  <br>00:58:44.839 from putting menu calorie labels on  <br>00:58:46.680 things is true by this much at the  <br>00:58:49.400 margins and it's just largely not the  <br>00:58:51.839 case adjacent to that is this idea of  <br>00:58:54.160 muscle dysmorphia which affects  <br>00:58:56.599 a lot of people but specifically men  <br>00:58:58.839 roughly 87% of men that are between 15  <br>00:59:01.960 to 32 years old that experience muscle  <br>00:59:05.200 dysmorphia which is what so muscle  <br>00:59:08.920 dysmorphia generally is for whatever  <br>00:59:11.799 level of jacked that you are you think  <br>00:59:14.520 you are considerably less jacked both in  <br>00:59:17.720 reference to yourself and your own  <br>00:59:19.359 desires and in reference to an ethereal  <br>00:59:21.920 make belief comparator population in  <br>00:59:23.920 your head so if you were to ask like hey  <br>00:59:26.920 Mike do you feel jacked and I'm like  <br>00:59:29.559 nope you're like oo not good not a good  <br>00:59:31.720 sign clearly he's jacked and then you  <br>00:59:33.640 can ask me Mike compared to other  <br>00:59:35.440 40-year-old ashkanazi Jewish men how  <br>00:59:38.400 Jacked are you and if I'm like I'm  <br>00:59:40.160 probably like bottom 50% for sure  <br>00:59:42.520 probably bottom 25 to' be like okay he's  <br>00:59:44.480 mentally ill take him away that is high  <br>00:59:46.760 level muscle dysmorphia a disassociation  <br>00:59:49.760 from any objective reality about how  <br>00:59:52.520 much muscle you actually have do people  <br>00:59:55.680 over estimate or underestimate their  <br>00:59:57.599 appearance as it relates to their  <br>00:59:59.039 muscles uh dysmorphia is almost always  <br>01:00:01.920 cataloged as an underestimation but but  <br>01:00:04.760 from your experience working with people  <br>01:00:06.119 do people think they're more jacked than  <br>01:00:07.480 they actually are it really depends on  <br>01:00:09.760 the individual most people that are in  <br>01:00:12.160 gym culture that are very invested if  <br>01:00:15.200 you catch them on their not so great  <br>01:00:16.799 days they think they're substantially  <br>01:00:19.440 less jacked than they really are and if  <br>01:00:21.720 you tease it apart via conversation  <br>01:00:23.880 they'll end up being like yeah no no I  <br>01:00:25.160 know I'm jacked but I'm just saying like  <br>01:00:26.880 and then it's aspirational like for my  <br>01:00:28.920 goals I'm not as jacked as I would like  <br>01:00:31.079 to be it's interesting because we  <br>01:00:32.799 typically think of women I think  <br>01:00:35.319 stereotypically in society as caring  <br>01:00:38.160 more about their body image but I've  <br>01:00:41.880 I've read a lot of stats lately that  <br>01:00:43.079 suggest men care equally about their  <br>01:00:44.920 body image but just in slightly  <br>01:00:46.280 different ways and the about the  <br>01:00:47.839 correlation between their perception of  <br>01:00:49.440 their body image and their own mental  <br>01:00:50.720 health and the link between the two sure  <br>01:00:53.640 sure do you see a lot of that do you see  <br>01:00:55.240 this link between Health in male body  <br>01:00:57.160 image yes huge proportion of  <br>01:01:00.799 psychological proclivities are genetic  <br>01:01:03.200 the others are very individually  <br>01:01:05.720 acquired they change through time it's  <br>01:01:07.920 not as easy as saying upbringing or  <br>01:01:09.680 family environment so the one consistent  <br>01:01:12.160 thing about how you relate to the world  <br>01:01:13.760 in your own thoughts is genetics and a  <br>01:01:16.400 lot of the traits tend to aggregate  <br>01:01:18.400 together so it is true to say on a  <br>01:01:21.839 spectrum very nuanced that some people  <br>01:01:25.240 aggregate a lot of negative  <br>01:01:26.799 psychological traits and some people  <br>01:01:28.920 aggregate a lot of positives and there  <br>01:01:30.520 absolutely people everyone's a mixed bag  <br>01:01:32.039 somewhere in between but there's a  <br>01:01:33.119 little bit of this kind of I don't want  <br>01:01:34.960 to use a a term for another mental a  <br>01:01:37.240 bipolarity to the distribution right and  <br>01:01:39.839 so a lot of people that are generally  <br>01:01:42.359 neurotic they feel consistently uh  <br>01:01:45.160 unsafe and unsure of themselves are  <br>01:01:47.440 going to be also the type of people that  <br>01:01:49.160 when they get more jacked through  <br>01:01:50.359 lifting they're still not going to  <br>01:01:51.920 believe that they're as jacked and  <br>01:01:53.400 accomplished and awesome and alpha male  <br>01:01:55.279 as they really are because they're  <br>01:01:56.839 always like you know to use the old  <br>01:01:58.640 Jewish joke stereotype  <br>01:02:00.319 like I'm never going to be big and it's  <br>01:02:02.960 like you're already big like oh I don't  <br>01:02:04.599 know it could get it could get worse  <br>01:02:06.039 tomorrow and a lot of people just bring  <br>01:02:08.680 that to the table and so when you get  <br>01:02:10.799 neurotic people jacked they don't think  <br>01:02:12.520 they're that jacked they're always like  <br>01:02:13.760 oh my God it's always going to end but  <br>01:02:15.440 if you take not neurotic people and make  <br>01:02:17.839 them jacked one week of lifting into  <br>01:02:20.799 those people and they're like dude I'm  <br>01:02:22.079 like do you think I should turn pro in  <br>01:02:23.640 bodybuilding like get out of here you're  <br>01:02:25.119 just overon  <br>01:02:26.480 so it really depends on who's doing the  <br>01:02:28.319 thing now cultural stuff social who's in  <br>01:02:30.920 your circle I'll give you a good example  <br>01:02:33.520 I have a lot of my closest friends have  <br>01:02:36.520 no relation to Fitness whatsoever a  <br>01:02:38.279 bunch of them are actually  <br>01:02:38.920 neuroscientists just randomly people I  <br>01:02:40.880 knew in college that ended up being my  <br>01:02:42.319 friends for life and so when they assess  <br>01:02:45.079 their muscularity relative to myself and  <br>01:02:47.520 my bodybuilder friends they're like I'm  <br>01:02:50.079 in terrible shape and I'm not remotely  <br>01:02:51.599 jacked and they have such a weird  <br>01:02:53.440 comparator population that I always  <br>01:02:55.039 remind them like dude dude not everyone  <br>01:02:56.599 looks like this they go to the store  <br>01:02:57.760 they go to school they go to the bank  <br>01:02:58.720 and they're like oh crap you're right  <br>01:03:00.359 I'm actually the most jacked person at  <br>01:03:01.720 the bank it's just not like Gold's Gym  <br>01:03:03.480 where everyone's enormous so if you  <br>01:03:05.319 happen to be in an environment let's say  <br>01:03:07.400 you're a university student and you go  <br>01:03:08.920 to the University gym and there's lots  <br>01:03:10.559 of jacked people there and you're there  <br>01:03:11.839 all the time trying to do your best you  <br>01:03:13.960 may if you're neurotic to begin with  <br>01:03:15.720 more neurotic start to develop a sense  <br>01:03:17.839 that you're just not nearly as jacked as  <br>01:03:20.400 you should be or could be or whatever  <br>01:03:22.200 but if you like hang out at an old  <br>01:03:23.480 people home with your grandma and  <br>01:03:24.599 grandpa all the time you're going to  <br>01:03:25.799 feel like Superman all the time because  <br>01:03:27.480 holy [ __ ] you're like you can do real  <br>01:03:28.960 things and move furniture around and and  <br>01:03:31.400 so then go back to that point about  <br>01:03:32.440 weight loss if I'm trying to lose weight  <br>01:03:34.200 what are the biggest biggest myths  <br>01:03:36.200 around weight loss that hold people back  <br>01:03:38.440 and inhibit them one is you have to be  <br>01:03:40.839 perfect if I'm on my diet I'm good if  <br>01:03:43.880 I'm off my diet not only am I bad but as  <br>01:03:46.599 soon as I'm off my diet I have sinned  <br>01:03:48.880 and there is no Solace for me um I a lot  <br>01:03:53.279 of people have that falling off the  <br>01:03:54.520 bandwagon thing where eat clean food  <br>01:03:57.400 whatever that means diet food for weeks  <br>01:03:59.880 and weeks and weeks they have one Kebab  <br>01:04:01.799 they have one cheeseburger and they're  <br>01:04:03.039 like do it that's it man I'm done  <br>01:04:06.880 dieting I'm not a good person anymore  <br>01:04:08.599 it's like that whole dichotomizing and  <br>01:04:11.119 kind of a religious approach that hurts  <br>01:04:13.440 a lot of people because in reality if  <br>01:04:15.760 you just Eat A Cheeseburger your body's  <br>01:04:17.559 like oh sweet like I got a little bit  <br>01:04:18.960 more carbohydrates stored in the muscle  <br>01:04:20.960 I recovered a little bit more my diet  <br>01:04:22.720 fatigue is actually a little lower  <br>01:04:23.839 because you fed me some food tomorrow  <br>01:04:26.160 I'm back on the diet I'm making even  <br>01:04:27.559 better gains than if I didn't have that  <br>01:04:28.839 cheeseburger I was so exhausted and so a  <br>01:04:31.680 lot of people have that approach  <br>01:04:33.240 completely backwards and they're like  <br>01:04:34.480 I'm either good or I'm bad and and  <br>01:04:36.559 that's really tough another one is  <br>01:04:38.960 people think that the approach to lose  <br>01:04:41.160 weight is the same as the approach to  <br>01:04:43.039 maintain it um this is really really  <br>01:04:45.680 really nasty because so my wife is a uh  <br>01:04:48.839 board-certified uh Family Med Sports Med  <br>01:04:51.400 doctor and she does a lot of work  <br>01:04:53.720 international Olympic teams all that  <br>01:04:55.200 stuff  <br>01:04:56.279 and she is looking at these formal  <br>01:04:59.079 recommendations from the medical  <br>01:05:00.520 literature and it's like here's the kind  <br>01:05:02.599 of diet you need to get to lose weight  <br>01:05:05.480 and then she was like she followed up  <br>01:05:07.079 with some of the professionals and she's  <br>01:05:08.240 like and so what about maintenance and  <br>01:05:09.640 they're like uh yep what do you mean yep  <br>01:05:13.559 what are you talking about that's not  <br>01:05:15.400 the conversation so people think okay  <br>01:05:17.480 I'm going to clean up my diet no more  <br>01:05:19.039 ice cream no more no more crisps no more  <br>01:05:21.000 Cheetos I'm gonna eat super healthy and  <br>01:05:23.960 then when I get to the weight that I  <br>01:05:25.279 want  <br>01:05:26.480 I eat continuously super Health never  <br>01:05:29.799 have ice cream again what kind of  <br>01:05:31.520 bizarre world is it and so they'll flop  <br>01:05:33.359 back to the other one well they'll try  <br>01:05:35.000 for a few months after they've gotten to  <br>01:05:36.359 the weight they like to just eat  <br>01:05:37.760 completely super healthy clean  <br>01:05:39.200 everything like that they lose a little  <br>01:05:40.400 bit more weight they're exhausted  <br>01:05:41.760 they're tired they're food focus is  <br>01:05:43.200 driving them nuts they'll eat some ice  <br>01:05:45.319 cream and they'll go I'm a sinner and  <br>01:05:47.720 then ice cream ice cream cheeseburgers  <br>01:05:49.440 cheeseburgers up they go and then they  <br>01:05:51.200 regain all the weight so a huge myth is  <br>01:05:53.640 the fact that yeah when you're you're  <br>01:05:55.760 losing weight you got to pay a little  <br>01:05:57.079 bit more attention to what you eat but  <br>01:05:58.960 once you've gotten to that weight you  <br>01:06:01.079 both need some time roughly every 3  <br>01:06:04.079 months that you diet hard to lose weight  <br>01:06:06.520 you should be taking about at least two  <br>01:06:08.000 months at maintenance just maintaining  <br>01:06:09.720 it so if you weigh 100 kilos iron down  <br>01:06:11.799 to 90 after 3 months for about two or 3  <br>01:06:14.559 months just stay at 90 eat mostly the  <br>01:06:17.240 healthy stuff that you were but throw a  <br>01:06:18.760 little junk in there maintenance again  <br>01:06:20.799 is much easier than losing when  <br>01:06:23.760 physiologically and psychologically your  <br>01:06:26.240 diet fatigue comes down after those two  <br>01:06:28.160 or three months you're able if you'd  <br>01:06:30.319 like to start dieting really hard again  <br>01:06:32.839 to get to that next goal that you have  <br>01:06:34.599 or you just live in balance for the rest  <br>01:06:36.680 but if we tell you like here's your diet  <br>01:06:38.400 to make you lean and healthy and you're  <br>01:06:39.520 like okay how long do I have to do this  <br>01:06:40.640 and the doctor's like  <br>01:06:42.279 forever what what am I supposed to do  <br>01:06:44.359 I'm never I'm never allowed to have  <br>01:06:45.480 teramis Su after dinner ever again I'm  <br>01:06:47.240 like well probably not to that's  <br>01:06:49.279 terrible advice and not only do medical  <br>01:06:50.920 people too often say that most people  <br>01:06:53.039 have that in their heads and it's it's a  <br>01:06:54.520 very very untenable sitation one of the  <br>01:06:56.599 big sort of narratives that I was  <br>01:06:59.079 exposed to for most of my life about  <br>01:07:00.720 weight loss is that 80% of its  <br>01:07:03.799 diet what do you think about those  <br>01:07:05.680 ratios how much of weight loss is  <br>01:07:07.240 determined by diet versus exercise  <br>01:07:10.480 yeah diet has a bigger effect than  <br>01:07:14.000 exercise as a heuristic I'm very  <br>01:07:16.240 comfortable with 8020 there are a couple  <br>01:07:18.480 reasons for that one  <br>01:07:21.200 is there's a constrained energy  <br>01:07:24.200 hypothesis  <br>01:07:25.920 it's also called ponor Paradox based on  <br>01:07:28.119 Herman ponor work and physical  <br>01:07:29.960 anthropology and  <br>01:07:31.960 so basically they realize that the  <br>01:07:34.720 amount of physical activity that humans  <br>01:07:36.559 can do has a range but if you try to get  <br>01:07:40.520 people to like double their physical  <br>01:07:42.559 activity you say I'm not going to change  <br>01:07:44.240 my diet I'm GNA work out twice as much  <br>01:07:46.559 as the next guy your body becomes so  <br>01:07:49.760 fatigued so rapidly and your metabolism  <br>01:07:52.799 adjusts itself your physical activity  <br>01:07:54.799 that's not planned exercise like how  <br>01:07:56.799 much do you get up when someone calls  <br>01:07:58.640 you are you still on the couch talking  <br>01:08:00.039 to them or how much do you get up and  <br>01:08:01.400 walk around your kitchen a bunch your  <br>01:08:03.559 body makes all these adjustments so if  <br>01:08:05.680 you try to really outwork a bad diet it  <br>01:08:08.880 doesn't work and usually you just come  <br>01:08:10.839 back to the same physical activity  <br>01:08:12.240 because you're too exhausted to continue  <br>01:08:13.680 and then you failed whereas with diet  <br>01:08:16.600 you can make some dietary changes  <br>01:08:18.520 principle based like stop eating junk  <br>01:08:21.279 food every day and just eat two pieces  <br>01:08:23.839 of junk food on Friday and two pieces of  <br>01:08:26.158 junk food on Saturday just that alone is  <br>01:08:29.080 sustainable your body as long as these  <br>01:08:31.120 are filling Foods a lot of veggies  <br>01:08:33.479 fruits whole grains lean meats you're  <br>01:08:35.279 not hungry you're just like damn it I  <br>01:08:37.679 want a bag of chips that's not a reason  <br>01:08:40.279 that is mostly psychological it's not  <br>01:08:42.080 physiological and thus dieting is just  <br>01:08:44.839 able to take bigger chunks out of your  <br>01:08:46.920 calorie balance equation without  <br>01:08:49.000 completely destroying it that has limits  <br>01:08:50.640 as well you can't D it forever so you  <br>01:08:52.759 have to take it in chunks another thing  <br>01:08:54.759 is this in order  <br>01:08:56.839 to burn a lot of calories to lose a lot  <br>01:09:00.600 of weight you got to do some serious  <br>01:09:03.560 work the average person will burn  <br>01:09:05.679 something like 100 to 150 calories per  <br>01:09:09.799 mile  <br>01:09:11.040 run oh my God you start thinking about  <br>01:09:13.560 it like a doughnut has 300 calories how  <br>01:09:17.000 fast Stephen can you eat a doughnut if I  <br>01:09:18.799 time  <br>01:09:19.719 you 5 Seconds five no problem boom you  <br>01:09:23.600 going to run three miles after each  <br>01:09:25.040 donut it's insane so taking your diet  <br>01:09:28.799 cleaning it up reducing the junk  <br>01:09:30.040 reducing the calories is not that hard  <br>01:09:32.759 but if you try to fight off the nasty  <br>01:09:34.920 extra junk food calories you're taking  <br>01:09:36.359 in with exercise it's kind of like a  <br>01:09:38.679 three to one fight you you eat two  <br>01:09:41.560 Donuts at your work function after work  <br>01:09:43.920 you got six miles to run that day nobody  <br>01:09:45.920 doing that and that's why diet is such a  <br>01:09:49.359 huge factor it's so easy to do quote  <br>01:09:51.439 unquote damage with it and it's much  <br>01:09:53.359 easier to take control of it versus  <br>01:09:55.520 exercise the boundary layers are just  <br>01:09:57.480 smaller and what you would have to do to  <br>01:09:59.320 fight the bad diet is just grotesquely  <br>01:10:01.440 large and outside of those boundary  <br>01:10:02.840 layers I think this a lot because I  <br>01:10:04.120 think people typically assume that the  <br>01:10:05.719 way to lose weight is to go do a run  <br>01:10:08.000 yeah that's typically you know you'll  <br>01:10:09.679 see people in the gym and if you ask  <br>01:10:11.199 someone why they're on the running  <br>01:10:12.360 machine they'll probably say I'm trying  <br>01:10:13.440 to lose some weight  <br>01:10:15.199 yeah it helps a little  <br>01:10:17.440 bit but if you run and you burn 200  <br>01:10:21.320 calories extra per day 3 days per week  <br>01:10:24.239 then is 600 extra calories you're  <br>01:10:25.920 burning through the week that's good  <br>01:10:28.159 stuff you can lose some decent weight  <br>01:10:30.360 like that are you just going to be more  <br>01:10:31.719 hungry though afterwards uh typically  <br>01:10:34.120 exercise does not dependably increase  <br>01:10:36.159 your hunger in most people so uh uh  <br>01:10:39.360 depending on the context in the  <br>01:10:40.640 individual it's not a Dependable thing  <br>01:10:42.360 to say that doing more exercise  <br>01:10:43.920 necessarily makes you more hungry which  <br>01:10:45.560 is kind of cool because usually you're  <br>01:10:46.880 not really any more hungry and if you  <br>01:10:48.520 stick consistently exercise but you  <br>01:10:50.440 control your diet you're good to go  <br>01:10:52.920 however is there a psychological  <br>01:10:54.000 component to that where because done the  <br>01:10:55.800 run I now feel like I deserve it oh yeah  <br>01:10:59.000 that's huge and some people do have a  <br>01:11:00.679 hunger response but what you put|### SUMMARY  <br>Dr. Michael Israetel discusses effective muscle building strategies, emphasizing minimal time investment and dispelling workout myths.  <br>  <br>### IDEAS:  <br>- Consistency is more important than the total workout hours for muscle building success.  <br>- Specificity in exercise routines leads to better results in targeted muscle growth.  <br>- Even minimal workout duration can yield significant body transformation with proper strategies.  <br>- Muscle gain is retained even after a period of inactivity, thanks to muscle memory.  <br>- Nutrition plays a crucial role in achieving fitness goals, alongside exercise.  <br>- Individuals often overestimate the time required for fitness transformations; efficiency is key.  <br>- Many common fitness myths hinder progress, including the need for extensive gym hours.  <br>- Recovery and nutrition are just as important as the workout itself for muscle growth.  <br>- Psychological factors significantly impact motivation and adherence to fitness routines.  <br>- Gym anxiety is a real concern that affects many newcomers to fitness.  <br>- Effective plans for muscle gain can be tailored to individual goals and lifestyle constraints.  <br>- Two to three sets of targeted exercises can lead to substantial muscle growth.  <br>- The right warm-up can enhance performance and prevent injuries during workouts.  <br>- Meal timing and nutrient quality can influence overall health and muscle growth.  <br>- Sustainable habits are crucial for long-term weight maintenance after reaching fitness goals.  <br>- Caloric intake and expenditure are fundamental in managing body weight effectively.  <br>- Muscle growth is primarily stimulated by tension, not solely dependent on the workout environment.  <br>- Resistance training can be highly effective even with minimal equipment at home.  <br>- Many people underestimate the role of good technique in maximizing workout effectiveness.  <br>- Body image perceptions can influence workout motivation and self-esteem in fitness enthusiasts.  <br>- Eating disorders are complex and not solely caused by calorie awareness or food labeling.  <br>  <br>### INSIGHTS:  <br>- Achieving fitness goals requires a balance of consistent exercise and proper nutrition strategies.  <br>- Many individuals mistakenly think extensive workout hours are necessary for noticeable results.  <br>- Muscle memory allows individuals to regain strength faster after periods of inactivity.  <br>- Effective muscle training relies on both physical and psychological readiness before workouts.  <br>- Regularly revisiting and adjusting fitness goals can enhance motivation and prevent burnout.  <br>- Sustainable dietary habits are crucial for maintaining weight loss and overall health.  <br>- The quality and timing of meals can significantly affect physical performance and recovery.  <br>- Strength training can be accomplished effectively with minimal equipment at home.  <br>- Psychological barriers often impede progress in fitness; addressing these can improve outcomes.  <br>- Understanding the science behind muscle growth can motivate individuals to stick with their routines.  <br>  <br>### QUOTES:  <br>- "Doing this at home will give you phenomenal overall results with not so much time investment."  <br>- "The consistency that matters doesn't matter if it's 2 hours a week or 18 hours a week."  <br>- "Every real working set should be challenging."  <br>- "You can get amazing benefits with minimal time investment."  <br>- "Nutrition for being more lean, more muscular, and healthier... has all these kinds of ideas."  <br>- "Muscle growth occurs when your body is resting, not during the gym session."  <br>- "If you don’t lift for 2 weeks, you start to lose muscle."  <br>- "The average person will burn something like 100 to 150 calories per mile run."  <br>- "Diet has a bigger effect than exercise; it’s easier to control dietary intake."  <br>- "Sustainable habits lead to long-term success in maintaining weight loss."  <br>- "Fitness won't elevate your status as a better person in some way."  <br>- "Training at home is a bit of a different world but can yield amazing results."  <br>- "You can get into really good shape with not so much time investment."  <br>- "You don’t grow muscle at the gym; you give yourself a signal to grow muscle."  <br>- "Calories in, calories out is incontrovertible for the vast majority of people."  <br>- "Muscle dysmorphia often leads individuals to underestimate their actual muscle mass."  <br>- "You can eat regular foods and still achieve great fitness results."  <br>- "The muscle memory effect allows you to regain size faster after a break."  <br>- "Eating disorders are influenced more by genetic and social factors than by calorie awareness."  <br>- "You should be training for hypertrophy with a focus on good technique."  <br>- "Diet fatigue can lead to the perception of needing to be perfect in weight loss."  <br>  <br>### HABITS:  <br>- Consistently assess and adjust fitness goals to stay motivated and aligned with personal desires.  <br>- Incorporate strength training sessions two to three times a week for optimal muscle growth.  <br>- Utilize a balanced diet that includes protein, vegetables, and healthy fats for muscle recovery.  <br>- Prioritize sleep and rest to enhance overall fitness and recovery processes.  <br>- Warm up properly before workouts to improve performance and prevent injuries.  <br>- Track nutritional intake to maintain awareness of caloric and macronutrient consumption.  <br>- Use minimal equipment at home to create effective workout routines.  <br>- Avoid comparing yourself to others in fitness settings to maintain a positive mindset.  <br>- Take regular breaks from intense dieting to maintain motivation and prevent burnout.  <br>- Focus on the quality of movements during weight training for better muscle activation.  <br>  <br>### FACTS:  <br>- Muscle growth primarily occurs when the body is in a state of rest and recovery.  <br>- The average person burns approximately 100 to 150 calories while running a mile.  <br>- Effective muscle training can be achieved with only a couple of hours per week.  <br>- Inactivity leads to muscle loss, starting around two weeks after the last workout.  <br>- Muscle memory significantly aids in regaining strength after periods of inactivity.  <br>- The majority of people find calorie counting unsustainable for long-term weight management.  <br>- Proper nutrition is critical in supporting muscle growth and overall fitness goals.  <br>- Resistance training can be effectively done at home with minimal equipment.  <br>- Emotional and psychological factors play a significant role in fitness adherence.  <br>- Muscle dysmorphia is prevalent among men, leading to distorted self-perceptions of fitness.  <br>  <br>### REFERENCES:  <br>- Dr. Michael Israetel's YouTube channel, which has over 7 million subscribers.  <br>- Discussion on various fitness myths and strategies for effective muscle building.  <br>- Mention of scientific studies related to muscle memory and retraining effects.  <br>- Insights on the role of nutrition and exercise in achieving fitness goals.  <br>- Reference to training techniques and methodologies for muscle hypertrophy.  <br>  <br>### ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY  <br>Effective muscle building requires consistency, proper nutrition, and understanding the science behind fitness routines.  <br>  <br>### RECOMMENDATIONS:  <br>- Focus on consistent training rather than excessive workout hours for effective results.  <br>- Tailor workout plans to individual goals for optimal muscle growth and efficiency.  <br>- Incorporate a variety of exercises

Revolution much of which  <br>00:02:38.879 has been led by you your books have sold  <br>00:02:40.720 millions and millions and millions of  <br>00:02:41.920 copies around the world your  <br>00:02:43.560 conversations online have millions and  <br>00:02:44.920 millions and millions and millions of  <br>00:02:45.920 views more than I could possibly  <br>00:02:47.879 count what's going on with glucose the  <br>00:02:51.360 thing is glucose has always been  <br>00:02:53.599 incredibly important to our health but  <br>00:02:56.200 it's been going on behind the scenes but  <br>00:02:59.599 now now but with the technology that we  <br>00:03:01.080 have glucose monitors new science we're  <br>00:03:03.440 actually able to get a real good handle  <br>00:03:05.040 on it and understand our diet through  <br>00:03:07.599 that lens so most of us Stephen have  <br>00:03:11.920 unhealthy glucose levels to give you an  <br>00:03:14.000 example one billion people in the world  <br>00:03:15.959 have either type two diabetes or  <br>00:03:17.959 pre-diabetes one billion and that number  <br>00:03:20.680 is increasing every single day and then  <br>00:03:22.840 in people who don't have any health  <br>00:03:24.400 issues up to 80% of the population still  <br>00:03:27.360 has glucose spikes every single day and  <br>00:03:30.319 this leads to lots of symptoms from  <br>00:03:31.959 mental health problems to fertility to  <br>00:03:33.760 acne to faster aging glucose is really  <br>00:03:36.400 important and I'm really happy that  <br>00:03:37.599 we're talking about it more what have  <br>00:03:39.319 you have you been surprised by how much  <br>00:03:41.239 people have woken up to glucose sugar  <br>00:03:44.120 yeah definitely I think even the word  <br>00:03:46.159 glucose people used to know blood sugar  <br>00:03:47.879 but now the fact that people know what  <br>00:03:49.080 glucose is makes me quite happy that's  <br>00:03:51.159 the scientific way to refer to blood  <br>00:03:53.640 sugar it's surprising but the thing is  <br>00:03:55.799 like I'm on the inside I'm working every  <br>00:03:57.599 single day to make sure people know what  <br>00:03:58.959 glucose is so it's like you know when  <br>00:04:01.079 you put the frog in the water and then  <br>00:04:02.560 you slowly boil the water you know that  <br>00:04:04.120 image and the Frog doesn't notice the  <br>00:04:05.560 water is boiling that's how I feel  <br>00:04:07.120 because I've been doing this for five  <br>00:04:08.720 years now so I can tell now if I compare  <br>00:04:11.720 today to five years ago there's been a  <br>00:04:13.200 huge shift but I've been looking at it  <br>00:04:15.319 every single day day by day and the  <br>00:04:17.798 increase has been very gradual how do  <br>00:04:20.600 you define yourself there's this sort of  <br>00:04:23.840 name you go under the glucose goddess  <br>00:04:26.080 but professionally if someone says what  <br>00:04:28.840 you do H how do you define that I say  <br>00:04:31.039 I'm a biochemist I'm a biochemist  <br>00:04:34.039 passionate about sharing science in a  <br>00:04:36.320 fun accessible sexy way that's what I  <br>00:04:38.080 like to do these cgms continuous glucose  <br>00:04:41.400 monitors that everybody seems to be  <br>00:04:43.240 wearing these days they're much of the  <br>00:04:46.720 the reason people I guess know you  <br>00:04:51.759 because you post these incredible graphs  <br>00:04:53.520 on your Instagram showing the impact  <br>00:04:55.479 that of the things we on our glucose  <br>00:04:58.479 levels yeah I want to start there when I  <br>00:05:01.520 eat something sweet and full of sugar  <br>00:05:04.199 there's a spike in my CGM so my  <br>00:05:06.880 continuous glucose monitor does does the  <br>00:05:09.520 spike mean that something bad is going  <br>00:05:12.360 on in my body kind of yeah so I'll go  <br>00:05:16.919 just one step back there's lots of  <br>00:05:19.319 different categories of foods but there  <br>00:05:20.960 are two that impact our blood sugar  <br>00:05:23.039 levels it's starches so that's bread  <br>00:05:26.479 rice pasta potatoes oats and sugars so  <br>00:05:30.479 anything sweet from an apple pie turn  <br>00:05:32.960 orange juice these two categories of  <br>00:05:35.120 foods they're literally made up of  <br>00:05:36.919 glucose molecules so when you eat them  <br>00:05:39.280 they break down into individual glucose  <br>00:05:41.039 molecules and the glucose molecules  <br>00:05:42.639 arrive into your blood if you eat a lot  <br>00:05:44.840 of starches and sugars at once a lot of  <br>00:05:46.919 glucose molecules are arriving into your  <br>00:05:48.600 blood and that's what you see that's the  <br>00:05:50.680 spike you see on your glucose monitor  <br>00:05:53.800 now these Spikes have a few different  <br>00:05:56.880 consequences you know having a few  <br>00:05:58.800 spikes here and there is not not a big  <br>00:06:00.000 deal but if you have really big spikes  <br>00:06:01.919 which I think most of us are discovering  <br>00:06:03.319 we have even if we don't have diabetes  <br>00:06:05.360 that's when problems start happening  <br>00:06:06.919 there's basically three processes that  <br>00:06:08.440 take place in your body when you spike  <br>00:06:10.639 it's chronic fatigue of your  <br>00:06:12.520 mitochondria aging glycation and then  <br>00:06:15.720 insulin release and I can go into detail  <br>00:06:18.000 into these but these are what underpin  <br>00:06:20.319 all the negative consequences of glucose  <br>00:06:22.400 spikes so start with that first one okay  <br>00:06:24.599 the mitochondria so there's these little  <br>00:06:26.800 factories in your cells that are in  <br>00:06:28.280 charge of making energy you must have  <br>00:06:29.800 learned this at school you know the  <br>00:06:30.919 mitochondria is the factory of the cell  <br>00:06:34.000 these little mitochondria are constantly  <br>00:06:36.160 trying to make energy for your body and  <br>00:06:38.919 they turn glucose into energy so you  <br>00:06:41.680 give them glucose through food they turn  <br>00:06:43.199 it into energy and then your brain uses  <br>00:06:45.479 the energy your heart to pump your ears  <br>00:06:47.680 to listen your eyes to see your whole  <br>00:06:50.080 body uses this energy and so you might  <br>00:06:52.440 think okay I want lots of energy so I  <br>00:06:54.479 should give my mitochondria lots of  <br>00:06:55.800 glucose That's The Logical conclusion  <br>00:06:57.960 you might come to but that where it  <br>00:06:59.919 completely collapses see biology is a  <br>00:07:01.639 bit weird take the example of a plant do  <br>00:07:04.319 you have any plants at home I do yeah  <br>00:07:05.919 okay are you able to keep them alive um  <br>00:07:08.319 my cleaning does a great job of keeping  <br>00:07:09.639 all them alive I have a super hard time  <br>00:07:12.560 but the reason I'm bringing up plants is  <br>00:07:14.440 because you know that plants need some  <br>00:07:15.919 water to live but if you give them too  <br>00:07:18.360 much water they drown and they die the  <br>00:07:21.240 human body is kind of the same some  <br>00:07:23.520 glucose amazing steady energy too much  <br>00:07:26.520 glucose and your little mitochondria  <br>00:07:28.680 start freaking out out they get  <br>00:07:30.960 overwhelmed by too much glucose Reviving  <br>00:07:33.240 their way they kind of go on strike and  <br>00:07:35.319 I'm French so I know but they sort of go  <br>00:07:37.560 on strike and they get overwhelmed and  <br>00:07:39.280 stressed out and they're not able to  <br>00:07:40.800 make energy effectively anymore because  <br>00:07:42.599 we're overloading them with too much  <br>00:07:44.960 glucose to process and as a human what  <br>00:07:47.960 do you feel you feel chronic fatigue you  <br>00:07:50.879 wake up you're exhausted thinking of  <br>00:07:52.599 going to the grocery store or picking up  <br>00:07:54.039 your kids is super tiring there's this  <br>00:07:57.720 Energy System in your body is just kind  <br>00:07:59.360 of of broken but you keep eating carbs  <br>00:08:01.639 you know croissant some bread something  <br>00:08:03.960 sweet but you keep being more and more  <br>00:08:05.919 tired that's your mitochondria  <br>00:08:08.080 dysfunctioning so that's the first thing  <br>00:08:09.960 that happens when you spike you get  <br>00:08:11.960 tired your mitochondria gets stressed  <br>00:08:16.199 out and one thing that's interesting is  <br>00:08:19.120 that sometimes when we eat something  <br>00:08:20.520 sweet especially in the morning like an  <br>00:08:21.879 orange juice we kind of feel a sense of  <br>00:08:25.520 like a like a rush of energy you know  <br>00:08:27.120 you have a big glass of orange juice and  <br>00:08:28.639 you sort of perk up for a sec most  <br>00:08:30.639 people think that that is energy what's  <br>00:08:33.159 actually going on is that Sugar releases  <br>00:08:35.640 dopamine in the brain and it's the  <br>00:08:37.679 pleasure molecule it's the same molecule  <br>00:08:39.440 that gets released when you have sex  <br>00:08:41.159 when you play video games when you do  <br>00:08:43.159 illegal drugs sugar releases dopamine  <br>00:08:46.080 it's pleasure it makes you kind of feel  <br>00:08:48.279 awake just briefly but actually that's  <br>00:08:50.800 not energy because on the inside your  <br>00:08:52.519 mitochondria are being damaged so we're  <br>00:08:54.640 being tricked by sugary foods and when  <br>00:08:56.399 we're tired we often reach for something  <br>00:08:58.600 sugary to per us up but it doesn't work  <br>00:09:00.720 on the inside so that's the first thing  <br>00:09:03.040 your mitochondria gets stressed out and  <br>00:09:05.600 as your mitochondria gets stressed out  <br>00:09:07.040 they also release what's called free  <br>00:09:08.480 radicals which is something that  <br>00:09:10.040 increases inflammation in the body and  <br>00:09:11.680 inflammation is really nasty thing we'll  <br>00:09:14.120 get to it in a sec the second thing that  <br>00:09:16.160 happens when you spike has to do with a  <br>00:09:18.440 chicken cooking in the oven so if you  <br>00:09:21.079 put you're looking at me weird but let  <br>00:09:22.399 me explain if you put a chicken in the  <br>00:09:25.000 oven it goes from pink to brown right  <br>00:09:28.600 you've seen this it books this process  <br>00:09:31.120 of cooking is called glycation it's the  <br>00:09:34.399 process of Browning or of cooking same  <br>00:09:37.040 thing when you toast a piece of toast  <br>00:09:38.399 for  <br>00:09:39.200 example the interesting thing is a human  <br>00:09:42.360 being from the moment we're born we're  <br>00:09:44.720 slowly cooking in that same way on the  <br>00:09:48.240 inside we're slowly glycating we're  <br>00:09:50.920 slowly Browning and then when we're  <br>00:09:53.720 fully glycated when we're fully cooked  <br>00:09:57.079 we die that's why when you look at the  <br>00:09:59.800 cartilage of babies it's white and if  <br>00:10:02.040 you look at the cartilage of somebody  <br>00:10:03.320 who's 90 years old it's brown they've  <br>00:10:05.600 cooked on the inside and every glucose  <br>00:10:08.279 Spike increases you're looking at your  <br>00:10:10.160 skin yeah from the outside we'd have to  <br>00:10:13.600 like open you up and look at your  <br>00:10:14.800 cartilage color got about 10 minutes  <br>00:10:18.839 left and every glucose Spike increases  <br>00:10:21.320 his process of glycation so much so that  <br>00:10:23.600 glucose and glycation they kind of sound  <br>00:10:26.120 like a similar word glucose glyc a it's  <br>00:10:30.440 because it's glucose doing the glycating  <br>00:10:33.920 so every glucose Spike increases  <br>00:10:36.519 glycation increases cooking accelerates  <br>00:10:39.519 aging and this shows on your skin you  <br>00:10:42.639 get wrinkles faster if you glycate more  <br>00:10:44.880 and also on the inside your organs  <br>00:10:47.079 slowly get damaged so glucose spikes  <br>00:10:50.200 mitochondria get tired you age  <br>00:10:53.320 faster in response to this your body  <br>00:10:56.480 knows Stephen that a big glucose spike  <br>00:10:58.880 is not good for you your body knows that  <br>00:11:01.279 it has to do something to try to get  <br>00:11:03.000 that glucose level down so what it does  <br>00:11:05.880 it calls up your pancreas and it's like  <br>00:11:08.000 yo pancreas we got a glucose bike going  <br>00:11:09.880 on we need to get this glucose down in  <br>00:11:12.839 response your pancreas sends a hormone  <br>00:11:14.880 called insulin out in your body you've  <br>00:11:17.079 heard of insulin before right and  <br>00:11:19.320 insulin's job and we love her her job is  <br>00:11:21.680 to grab all these excess glucose  <br>00:11:24.079 molecules and to store them away so they  <br>00:11:27.480 don't damage your body anymore and  <br>00:11:29.760 Insulin stores glucose away into your  <br>00:11:32.560 liver into your muscles and then when  <br>00:11:35.600 those are full insulin stores glucose  <br>00:11:38.000 away into your fat cells and that's one  <br>00:11:41.120 of the ways that you gain fat on your  <br>00:11:43.680 body it's in response to the spikes and  <br>00:11:46.000 your body trying to protect you from the  <br>00:11:48.079 spikes the problem is insulin itself has  <br>00:11:51.680 consequences and is the driver of type  <br>00:11:54.160 two diabetes and insulin resistance so  <br>00:11:56.600 to answer your question yes when you see  <br>00:11:58.480 a big spike on your glucose monitor  <br>00:12:00.600 there's some of that going on and the  <br>00:12:02.320 more spikes you have the harder it is  <br>00:12:04.120 going to be for your body to manage your  <br>00:12:05.680 spikes so it kind of becomes a vicious  <br>00:12:07.600 cycle if you keep eating the same way  <br>00:12:09.519 your spice will get bigger and bigger  <br>00:12:11.120 and bigger and bigger over time with  <br>00:12:12.760 more and more damage on that last point  <br>00:12:14.880 about where insulin stores the excess  <br>00:12:17.720 glucose does that mean that if I have  <br>00:12:19.279 more muscle mass I'm better at eating  <br>00:12:23.680 sugary products yep and that's why if  <br>00:12:26.480 you really love cookies the best time to  <br>00:12:28.399 eat them is right after you work out  <br>00:12:30.199 right before you work out because your  <br>00:12:32.120 muscles are really hungry for glucose  <br>00:12:33.880 all the time and the bigger your muscles  <br>00:12:35.440 are the more you use them the more  <br>00:12:37.440 they're going to capture some of that  <br>00:12:38.880 glucose for energy okay so me and my  <br>00:12:41.639 partner we both go to the gym she is  <br>00:12:43.440 significantly smaller than me in every  <br>00:12:44.639 way she's she's short she's you know  <br>00:12:47.279 she's lean um I'm bigger than her I have  <br>00:12:50.399 I have more muscle mass that means that  <br>00:12:52.480 if I have one cookie and she has the  <br>00:12:54.199 exact same cookie then her glucose  <br>00:12:56.680 response is going to be potentially  <br>00:12:58.000 significantly different to mine  <br>00:12:59.959 yes potentially so if you just look at  <br>00:13:02.000 muscle mass since you have more muscle  <br>00:13:03.639 mass you'll be able to handle that  <br>00:13:04.920 cookie better but there's so many things  <br>00:13:07.079 that influence glucose response for  <br>00:13:08.800 example your level of hydration how  <br>00:13:11.240 stressed you are your microbiome your  <br>00:13:13.279 genetics what time of the month you're  <br>00:13:14.920 in when you're female how well you've  <br>00:13:17.240 slept last night I mean there's a few  <br>00:13:19.560 factors so if you were just to compare  <br>00:13:21.360 your Spike to hers you couldn't really  <br>00:13:23.399 draw any conclusions because there's so  <br>00:13:25.720 many confounding variables there's  <br>00:13:28.000 confounding variables give me a window  <br>00:13:29.839 into some of them and why they matter  <br>00:13:31.360 and how they have an impact on my  <br>00:13:32.440 glucose  <br>00:13:33.440 response so I think muscles is a really  <br>00:13:35.839 good example right if two people eat the  <br>00:13:37.680 same exact cookie the person with more  <br>00:13:39.680 muscle mass is going to potentially see  <br>00:13:41.680 a smaller glucose Spike because their  <br>00:13:43.800 muscles are going to absorb more of that  <br>00:13:45.480 glucose and faster if you look at  <br>00:13:48.120 genetics some people are better at  <br>00:13:50.560 growing their fat cells and at growing  <br>00:13:52.680 the number and the size of their fat  <br>00:13:54.440 cells so they have a bigger Reservoir to  <br>00:13:57.160 put glucose in people of South Asian  <br>00:13:59.399 descent for example they tend to have a  <br>00:14:01.399 harder time putting on fat cells and as  <br>00:14:04.240 a result their glucose spikes tend to be  <br>00:14:06.360 bigger because they don't have that  <br>00:14:07.839 storage unit that they can access and  <br>00:14:10.320 increase the size of does that make  <br>00:14:11.880 sense yeah yeah yeah are there any foods  <br>00:14:15.399 that you have been surprised at when  <br>00:14:17.920 you've tested them because this is one  <br>00:14:19.680 of the really shocking things that I  <br>00:14:22.240 discovered when I wore a continuous  <br>00:14:23.360 glucose monitor is I would eat some  <br>00:14:25.759 things that I've been eating for a long  <br>00:14:27.839 long time and they would cause a spike  <br>00:14:29.839 and I like what I thought that was  <br>00:14:31.199 healthy yeah um but what are those  <br>00:14:33.600 things I guess for the suris the  <br>00:14:35.240 surprising ones not just for you but for  <br>00:14:36.880 people that message you and go oh my God  <br>00:14:38.639 Jesse I've been lied to about my tomato  <br>00:14:40.839 ketchup or okay I think the biggest ones  <br>00:14:42.959 are honey and grapes okay so grapes  <br>00:14:46.680 first you think it's a fruit it's  <br>00:14:49.399 healthy it's natural it's good for me  <br>00:14:51.120 right well actually all the fruit that  <br>00:14:53.519 we find today in supermarkets is not  <br>00:14:55.440 natural it is the product of human  <br>00:14:58.320 breeding for thousands and thousands of  <br>00:15:00.160 years to make them extra sweet extra  <br>00:15:02.519 juicy in the same way that humans have  <br>00:15:04.600 been breeding dogs from the time of the  <br>00:15:06.720 gray wolves into Chihuahua and Golden  <br>00:15:09.199 Retrievers these are not natural types  <br>00:15:11.880 of dogs we've bred wolves into these  <br>00:15:14.240 dogs fruit is the same thing we've bred  <br>00:15:17.360 pces of fruit to make these beautiful  <br>00:15:19.759 grapes without any seeds and just this  <br>00:15:22.199 little pocket of sugar and so a grape  <br>00:15:24.199 when you look at it actually it's just a  <br>00:15:26.199 big dose of sugar it's in the fruit  <br>00:15:29.199 format so people think it's good for  <br>00:15:30.480 them but actually when it comes to your  <br>00:15:31.680 glucose levels it's just big glucose  <br>00:15:34.360 Spike so those are really surprising all  <br>00:15:37.399 fruits it varies right so for example  <br>00:15:40.639 berries are lower in Sugar so create a  <br>00:15:43.120 smaller Spike but any tropical fruit  <br>00:15:45.600 like bananas mangoes papayas and then  <br>00:15:48.440 grapes also those are really high in  <br>00:15:50.279 sugar yeah but the thing is you know  <br>00:15:51.880 piece of whole fruit is okay because it  <br>00:15:54.079 has fiber in it the real problem comes  <br>00:15:56.759 when you denature that piece of fruit  <br>00:15:58.360 and you turn it into a juice for example  <br>00:16:00.639 cuz then you're removing that protective  <br>00:16:02.279 fiber just extracting the water and the  <br>00:16:04.480 sugar yeah I've not drank a glass of  <br>00:16:06.440 juice since starting this podcast  <br>00:16:07.959 because so many people have spoken to  <br>00:16:09.240 have told me that it's just like  <br>00:16:10.199 drinking sugar water yeah it's just like  <br>00:16:11.959 drinking a can of Coke but people think  <br>00:16:13.360 well it comes from a piece of fruit so  <br>00:16:15.240 it's natural orange juice comes from  <br>00:16:16.959 oranges therefore it's good for you  <br>00:16:18.920 because it's natural what they don't  <br>00:16:20.319 realize is that the sugar in a can of  <br>00:16:22.600 soda is also natural it comes from sugar  <br>00:16:25.639 beets or canes so if you're you're  <br>00:16:29.079 really looking at the source of the  <br>00:16:30.279 sugar you realize it doesn't matter at  <br>00:16:31.759 all they all come from plants what  <br>00:16:33.319 matters is the concentration and the  <br>00:16:35.240 medium that the sugar is in I understand  <br>00:16:38.600 grapes causing a glucose Spike because  <br>00:16:40.720 when I taste it it tastes sweet but  <br>00:16:43.079 there's some things that I eat that  <br>00:16:44.519 don't taste sweet that cause a glucose  <br>00:16:46.480 Spike and those are the things that I  <br>00:16:48.120 think lie to me like bread like bread  <br>00:16:50.560 like rice yeah well the thing is glucose  <br>00:16:53.399 is actually not sweet what you're  <br>00:16:55.279 tasting in fruit is fructose so let me  <br>00:16:58.199 explain so starches like bread pasta  <br>00:17:02.040 rice potatoes  <br>00:17:04.119 oats those are starches those are  <br>00:17:06.679 literally millions of glucose molecules  <br>00:17:09.439 just attached hand to hand like this  <br>00:17:12.359 that's a starch it's just a long chain  <br>00:17:14.000 of glucose when you eat the starch poof  <br>00:17:16.480 it turns into individual glucose  <br>00:17:17.880 molecules raises your blood sugar even  <br>00:17:19.959 though it doesn't taste sweet in a piece  <br>00:17:22.199 of fruit or in Sugar you're not eating  <br>00:17:24.839 starch what you're eating is sucrose  <br>00:17:27.599 different kind of molecule which which  <br>00:17:28.960 is half glucose half  <br>00:17:32.160 fructose yeah so when it breaks down it  <br>00:17:34.679 gives you glucose and a spike but also  <br>00:17:36.880 fructose that tastes really sweet but  <br>00:17:39.559 doesn't raise your blood sugar levels  <br>00:17:41.080 that much so again on the other side of  <br>00:17:43.480 the queen then are there foods that  <br>00:17:45.360 taste sweet but don't have an impact on  <br>00:17:47.000 my glucose yes  <br>00:17:48.919 sweeteners Stevia aspartame things like  <br>00:17:51.960 that so you saying that I should put  <br>00:17:54.880 sweeters in my food as opposed to Sugar  <br>00:17:58.240 well I think people need to realize that  <br>00:18:00.120 even though sweeteners are not super  <br>00:18:01.440 good for us right of course it's better  <br>00:18:02.960 to drink water than a diet soda the diet  <br>00:18:05.720 soda is better for you than the regular  <br>00:18:07.760 can of soda with the 30 grams of real  <br>00:18:09.880 sugar in there I personally would never  <br>00:18:13.200 have a can of real soda I would always  <br>00:18:15.159 have the diet soda always always always  <br>00:18:17.760 because those sweeteners don't raise  <br>00:18:20.159 your blood sugar levels okay they don't  <br>00:18:22.159 create that big spike and that big  <br>00:18:23.559 insulin Spike and then the drop is there  <br>00:18:26.200 such a good thing as good sugar m  <br>00:18:29.960 is there any such thing as good  <br>00:18:31.919 sugar  <br>00:18:33.520 no people often believe that if the  <br>00:18:36.400 sugar is coming from a fruit and is is  <br>00:18:38.640 for example in a fruit smoothie that  <br>00:18:40.440 they might have in the morning that's  <br>00:18:41.960 good sugar but that Sugar that's in a  <br>00:18:43.520 cake is bad sugar so people tend to  <br>00:18:46.960 compare these two and say oh well I'm  <br>00:18:49.159 having a fruit smoothie that's good for  <br>00:18:50.520 me but oh that chocolate cake would be  <br>00:18:52.080 bad for me that's a total lie it's all  <br>00:18:54.600 the same molecules the molecules in that  <br>00:18:57.039 fruit smoothie and the molecules in that  <br>00:18:59.039 chocolate cake are the same it's sucrose  <br>00:19:01.360 it's the same stuff and your body  <br>00:19:02.960 doesn't differentiate whether the sugar  <br>00:19:05.280 is in a fruit smoothie or the sugar is  <br>00:19:06.760 in a chocolate cake so all sugar is the  <br>00:19:09.679 same even you know honey Agave maple  <br>00:19:12.919 syrup all these things that have these  <br>00:19:14.520 Health Halos because of marketing it's  <br>00:19:16.440 all the same molecules so I recommend  <br>00:19:19.240 that people just have the sugar that  <br>00:19:20.600 they like best don't think that one is  <br>00:19:22.880 going to be better for you than the  <br>00:19:24.039 other and have all sugar as dessert so  <br>00:19:26.960 that fruit smoothie that's also dessert  <br>00:19:28.720 dessert it's not super healthy because  <br>00:19:30.400 it comes from fruits it's just like the  <br>00:19:31.880 chocolate cake and are there is there  <br>00:19:34.080 such a thing as good sweetness and bad  <br>00:19:36.000 sweetness yeah so there's a few  <br>00:19:37.400 categories so the ones that seem to be  <br>00:19:39.320 really fine for us are Stevia monk fruit  <br>00:19:43.039 and allulose the ones that have been  <br>00:19:45.799 linked to quite a few health issues are  <br>00:19:48.960 aspartame ml sucralose so for example a  <br>00:19:53.440 Spartan you usually find it in soda  <br>00:19:55.679 whereas Stevia you might buy a little  <br>00:19:57.320 packet at home and put it in your tea  <br>00:19:59.880 that being said the spart tame is still  <br>00:20:02.799 better for you than the real can of coke  <br>00:20:04.840 with a 30 grams of real sugar so Stevia  <br>00:20:06.960 is something that I shouldn't be no  <br>00:20:08.760 Stevia is good yeah you shouldn't be too  <br>00:20:10.159 concern do you use Stevia I didn't put  <br>00:20:12.039 any Sweetness in anything I didn't put  <br>00:20:13.440 sugar in anything either so I'm trying  <br>00:20:15.240 to stay away have coffee it's just black  <br>00:20:17.000 coffee you don't even eat chocolate of  <br>00:20:19.080 course I chocolate maybe not so much  <br>00:20:21.320 maybe that's not my thing but what's  <br>00:20:23.400 your sweet thing carrot cake what's your  <br>00:20:26.240 sweet thing oh chocolate I love  <br>00:20:28.120 chocolate like my favorite is is like  <br>00:20:29.960 chocolate ice cream with a chocolate  <br>00:20:31.480 brownie and chocolate sauce and  <br>00:20:32.960 chocolate sprinkles anything chocolate  <br>00:20:35.039 that's not very glucose godess well  <br>00:20:37.159 here's where you're wrong Stephen I'm  <br>00:20:38.640 actually not anti- sugar what are you  <br>00:20:40.320 talking about no I love sugar I eat  <br>00:20:42.840 sugar I eat carbs all the time but I  <br>00:20:44.679 want people to know what I know which is  <br>00:20:47.440 how and when to eat those things that's  <br>00:20:49.159 the end of the podcast thank you so much  <br>00:20:51.600 really great to see you  <br>00:20:54.360 again seriously we need to learn how to  <br>00:20:57.480 eat these things cuz they're so  <br>00:20:58.679 delicious in a way that's less bad for  <br>00:21:00.200 our health it's not about cutting them  <br>00:21:01.559 out that would be a diet I don't I'm not  <br>00:21:03.320 I'm not pro diets I'm Pro knowledge and  <br>00:21:06.039 I want to make sure people are not  <br>00:21:06.960 having sugar and dessert for breakfast  <br>00:21:09.000 you know sweet cereal in the morning and  <br>00:21:10.799 orange juice that's dessert anyway I'm  <br>00:21:13.840 all about just trying to empower people  <br>00:21:15.159 with the information so they don't get  <br>00:21:16.840 trapped by these marketing lies are we  <br>00:21:20.120 meant to be eating the amounts of sugar  <br>00:21:22.400 that we eat though like are we meant to  <br>00:21:24.039 be eating any sugar is what does our  <br>00:21:26.080 sort of evolutionary history tell us  <br>00:21:27.600 about our relationship with glucose I  <br>00:21:29.559 think fruit is something we're meant to  <br>00:21:31.279 be eating but the fruit that used to  <br>00:21:32.840 exist was less sweet and harder to  <br>00:21:35.600 digest and more fibrous and then in  <br>00:21:37.440 terms of starches starches are totally  <br>00:21:39.200 fine to eat the problem is today most of  <br>00:21:41.200 us just eat sugar and starches we've  <br>00:21:43.480 completely lost touch with the nice  <br>00:21:46.000 proteins and the organ meats and the  <br>00:21:48.320 fiber and the healthy fats we're in a  <br>00:21:50.360 situation where the food landscape is so  <br>00:21:52.120 toxic and it's so just starches and  <br>00:21:54.400 sugars that people are getting sicker  <br>00:21:55.760 and sicker and sicker and it's addictive  <br>00:21:58.080 and it's cheap so we're in a very  <br>00:22:00.600 difficult situation and that's the  <br>00:22:02.080 situation that you know the gp1s are  <br>00:22:03.880 trying to solve we're in a pickle we are  <br>00:22:06.360 in a pickle are you optimistic about the  <br>00:22:08.960 pickle we're in as it relates to sugar  <br>00:22:10.679 and  <br>00:22:13.880 Creos I have to say yes because the  <br>00:22:16.400 amount of Transformations I see in my  <br>00:22:18.919 readers is really encouraging you know  <br>00:22:21.320 people are reclaiming their health  <br>00:22:22.679 getting power over it understanding food  <br>00:22:25.200 again but we've got a lot of work to do  <br>00:22:27.400 and I can do my work educating people  <br>00:22:29.400 from the ground up on these hacks but we  <br>00:22:31.159 also need like systemic change we need  <br>00:22:33.039 policy we need governments to get  <br>00:22:35.320 involved and we need to find ways to  <br>00:22:37.320 make healthier food because we're just  <br>00:22:38.799 killing the population right now it's  <br>00:22:40.279 really terrible so talking about some of  <br>00:22:42.960 the consequences of a high glucose diet  <br>00:22:47.679 one of them you mentioned earlier when  <br>00:22:48.919 we were talking about glycation is  <br>00:22:51.360 aging has anyone ever done any research  <br>00:22:54.000 to prove that a high glucose diet is  <br>00:22:57.279 associated with correlated with  <br>00:23:00.279 increased or accelerated aging I mean  <br>00:23:03.159 yes because we see that the people who  <br>00:23:04.720 eat the most sugar get the most diseases  <br>00:23:08.240 right so we see correlations but they're  <br>00:23:09.919 not they're not like a clinical trial  <br>00:23:11.600 you can't take two populations and say  <br>00:23:13.440 okay everybody's 30 years old we're  <br>00:23:15.279 going to give this half a healthy no  <br>00:23:17.679 glucose Spike diet and this half glucose  <br>00:23:19.919 spikes every single day and then we'll  <br>00:23:21.480 see when they're 80 you know which group  <br>00:23:23.279 has aged faster we can't do that that's  <br>00:23:25.200 unethical so we have to look at  <br>00:23:27.039 correlations and we see things like if  <br>00:23:29.600 you have really high glucose levels High  <br>00:23:31.440 insulin levels you're more likely to get  <br>00:23:33.080 heart disease dementia depression etc  <br>00:23:36.360 etc we have correlative studies and we  <br>00:23:39.600 understand the mechanism of the  <br>00:23:41.080 glycation what about the superficial  <br>00:23:43.120 signs of aging wrinkles like the  <br>00:23:45.200 wrinkles a lot of skincare products  <br>00:23:47.440 actually Target glycation from the  <br>00:23:48.880 outside in so they'll put like  <br>00:23:50.360 antioxidants on your skin to reduce  <br>00:23:52.760 glycation if you're in the skincare  <br>00:23:54.200 World you'll see glycation mentioned  <br>00:23:55.760 everywhere what they don't do is they  <br>00:23:57.720 don't look at at how to reduce glycation  <br>00:24:00.320 from the inside out which is what I  <br>00:24:02.720 think is more interesting and it's  <br>00:24:04.279 through food by reducing your glucose  <br>00:24:06.000 levels you reduce glycation it's just  <br>00:24:08.000 like a A to B it's very simple so if I  <br>00:24:11.440 want to Stave off wrinkles then I should  <br>00:24:14.400 keep my glucose levels down yes and you  <br>00:24:16.559 should also avoid smoking you know wear  <br>00:24:18.720 sunscreen Etc but in terms of your diet  <br>00:24:20.960 what you want to focus on is focus on  <br>00:24:22.600 reducing glucose spikes yeah absolutely  <br>00:24:24.799 what about things like acne and skin  <br>00:24:26.799 conditions so those are more  <br>00:24:28.480 inflammatory based diseases so eczema  <br>00:24:31.720 psoriasis acne rosacea those are  <br>00:24:35.200 expressions of inflammation going on  <br>00:24:38.159 within your body and I like to think of  <br>00:24:39.720 the skin as a mirror to what's going on  <br>00:24:42.799 within and so inflamation can happen to  <br>00:24:45.600 loads of different factors but one of  <br>00:24:47.120 the factors is glucose spikes so glucose  <br>00:24:49.520 spikes hurt our mitochondria that  <br>00:24:51.840 creates inflammation then glucose spikes  <br>00:24:54.279 lead to glycation which also leads to  <br>00:24:56.159 inflammation and Insulin release and a  <br>00:24:58.600 lot of insulin also increases  <br>00:25:00.279 inflammation so with every glucose Spike  <br>00:25:02.200 you're increasing inflammation within  <br>00:25:04.320 your body and if you're susceptible to  <br>00:25:06.279 any of these skin conditions you can  <br>00:25:07.679 have fups or increase their intensity  <br>00:25:09.679 very simply and does it also have an  <br>00:25:12.640 impact on my hormonal balance I am a lot  <br>00:25:15.640 of my friends I'm in that age range now  <br>00:25:17.039 where a lot of my friends are trying to  <br>00:25:18.320 have children yeah and there's so much  <br>00:25:21.120 talk around things like polycystic ovary  <br>00:25:23.960 syndrome and fertility and you know  <br>00:25:27.720 infertility in men with their sperm and  <br>00:25:29.440 all these kinds of things is there a  <br>00:25:30.760 link between glucose and hormones and  <br>00:25:34.039 fertility yes so we have studies that  <br>00:25:36.440 show that the more insulin resistant you  <br>00:25:38.919 are so insulin resistance is a  <br>00:25:40.559 consequence of just a lot of insulin in  <br>00:25:42.200 the body the more likely you are to be  <br>00:25:43.960 infertile and then we also know that  <br>00:25:47.279 PCOS so polycystic ovarian syndrome  <br>00:25:49.320 which is one of the leading causes of  <br>00:25:51.080 infertility in women we know that 60% of  <br>00:25:53.919 PCOS cases also are people who have  <br>00:25:57.840 insulin resistance there's a link there  <br>00:26:00.559 insulin resistance you're more likely to  <br>00:26:02.399 have PCOS and we also know that when  <br>00:26:04.799 there's a lot of insulin in a female  <br>00:26:06.520 body it tells your ovaries to produce  <br>00:26:09.840 more testosterone testosterone is the  <br>00:26:12.720 male sex hormone and if you have too  <br>00:26:14.880 much male sex hormone in the body that  <br>00:26:17.360 causes issues it can cause acne it can  <br>00:26:19.679 cause balding or hair growth on the face  <br>00:26:21.960 and it can stop your period now often  <br>00:26:24.919 when somebody has PCOS they're given the  <br>00:26:26.880 birth control pill  <br>00:26:28.760 which kind of makes sense on the surface  <br>00:26:30.480 but really doesn't solve anything what  <br>00:26:32.279 happens when you take the birth control  <br>00:26:33.480 pill is that you're just ingesting  <br>00:26:35.120 female hormones that's what the pill is  <br>00:26:37.240 it's female hormones so if you have high  <br>00:26:39.640 testosterone all of a sudden you're  <br>00:26:41.320 ingesting female hormones so the balance  <br>00:26:44.320 kind of comes back to an okay situation  <br>00:26:46.960 your symptoms of excess testosterone go  <br>00:26:50.039 away but as soon as you stop the pill  <br>00:26:53.000 the high testosterone is still there so  <br>00:26:55.320 a lot of people stop the pill trying to  <br>00:26:57.279 have a baby and they're like oh  <br>00:26:58.799 I don't have my period I have PCOS what  <br>00:27:01.919 do I do so one recommendation I have is  <br>00:27:04.559 if you have PCOS look at your glucose  <br>00:27:06.360 bikes first it's not the only reason  <br>00:27:08.480 this can happen but very often when you  <br>00:27:10.799 fix your glucose and insulin levels the  <br>00:27:12.919 symptoms of PCOS go away I was saw  <br>00:27:15.880 something on Twitter a couple of weeks  <br>00:27:16.919 ago that was trying to make the case  <br>00:27:19.159 that glucose and Insulin responses are  <br>00:27:23.760 the reason for PCOS yeah some people  <br>00:27:26.799 believe that totally you know it's a  <br>00:27:29.000 very politically charged topic some  <br>00:27:31.840 people believe you have PCOS it's  <br>00:27:34.200 genetic you can't do anything about it  <br>00:27:35.960 other people believe no no it's a  <br>00:27:37.279 metabolic disease it's a cluster of  <br>00:27:39.120 symptoms that come from high insulin I'm  <br>00:27:40.919 in that camp but you know there are some  <br>00:27:43.519 cases where somebody has PCOS and  <br>00:27:45.159 doesn't have high insulin levels so what  <br>00:27:47.480 category do they go into the thing with  <br>00:27:49.279 PCOS Stephen is that it's not a real  <br>00:27:51.720 Condition it's like a cluster of  <br>00:27:53.120 symptoms so some people could have PCOS  <br>00:27:55.559 and have cystic ovaries and balding  <br>00:27:57.840 somebody else could have PCOS and have  <br>00:27:59.840 you know missed periods and hair growth  <br>00:28:02.000 on their chin so it can take different  <br>00:28:04.559 forms so I think we're starting to  <br>00:28:06.399 understand there there variations of  <br>00:28:08.320 PCOS and some are in the insulin  <br>00:28:10.399 resistant category have you seen a woman  <br>00:28:13.120 res reverse have PCOS symptoms tons in  <br>00:28:16.039 my second book I ran a study three  <br>00:28:19.159 females who were in the program doing my  <br>00:28:21.200 hacks for just a month got their period  <br>00:28:24.200 back and were able to get pregnant in  <br>00:28:26.760 that month just with my hacks I see PCOS  <br>00:28:29.200 reversal all the  <br>00:28:31.279 time so these hacks that you you say  <br>00:28:34.039 those three women use to help reverse  <br>00:28:36.440 their their PCOS  <br>00:28:38.480 symptoms what are the hacks oh the hacks  <br>00:28:42.120 what are the ones that they did so the  <br>00:28:43.720 ones they did were Savory  <br>00:28:46.399 breakfast vinegar once a day veggie  <br>00:28:50.039 starters and moving after eating and  <br>00:28:53.360 these are four hacks that are the four  <br>00:28:56.399 most important ones of my 10 hacks that  <br>00:28:59.320 I've put together in the four-week  <br>00:29:00.760 method that second  <br>00:29:02.760 book and if you do these hacks you don't  <br>00:29:06.080 actually have to change anything else  <br>00:29:07.399 that you're eating you don't have to cut  <br>00:29:08.919 out anything you just add these in I  <br>00:29:11.200 like to see them like um little fairy  <br>00:29:13.840 godmothers that you have in your pocket  <br>00:29:15.200 and you just put throughout your day  <br>00:29:16.320 like this and you're able to reduce your  <br>00:29:17.960 glucose spikes while still eating what  <br>00:29:19.600 you love in a very low efforts kind of  <br>00:29:21.840 way and I believe these hacks should be  <br>00:29:23.880 seen like you would  <br>00:29:25.440 see brush your teeth wear sunscreen  <br>00:29:28.640 drink enough water have a Savory  <br>00:29:30.240 breakfast move after eating have a  <br>00:29:32.000 Savory breakfast so are you saying  <br>00:29:34.120 people shouldn't be eating sugar for  <br>00:29:35.399 breakfast correct so the concept of a  <br>00:29:37.600 savory breakfast comes from the simple  <br>00:29:40.080 realization that if you have a breakfast  <br>00:29:43.360 that creates a big glucose Spike you're  <br>00:29:45.720 affecting your body in many bad ways  <br>00:29:48.760 first of all you're leading to your  <br>00:29:50.480 brain not functioning too well during  <br>00:29:52.480 that day it's leading to brain fog it  <br>00:29:54.519 can make you a bit confused second it  <br>00:29:56.399 makes you tired it increases Cravings  <br>00:29:58.919 throughout the day and it also  <br>00:30:00.440 deregulates your glucose levels for the  <br>00:30:02.840 rest of the day your breakfast is very  <br>00:30:05.039 powerful if you have a glucose bike at  <br>00:30:07.120 breakfast your whole day is a glucose  <br>00:30:09.279 roller coaster so what you want to do  <br>00:30:11.080 Stephen is always have a Savory  <br>00:30:13.440 breakfast that keeps your glucose level  <br>00:30:15.080 steady a Savory breakfast is what it's  <br>00:30:17.360 based around  <br>00:30:18.600 protein eggs uh fish meat tofu nuts  <br>00:30:23.360 Dairy protein powder dinner leftovers  <br>00:30:25.640 okay protein it's really important to  <br>00:30:27.600 have protein in the morning then you add  <br>00:30:29.399 some healthy fats olive oil butter  <br>00:30:31.840 avocado and then if you want for taste  <br>00:30:34.960 you can add a bit of starch like a piece  <br>00:30:37.080 of bread for example or some potatoes  <br>00:30:39.960 importantly a Savory breakfast contains  <br>00:30:42.159 nothing sweet no cereal no muffins no  <br>00:30:44.880 orange juice no granola no fruit puree  <br>00:30:48.960 none of that it's really key sugar in my  <br>00:30:51.080 coffee no no no no if you want sugar  <br>00:30:54.720 have it as dessert after a meal after  <br>00:30:57.360 lunch or after after dinner because  <br>00:30:59.159 after your lunch and after your dinner  <br>00:31:00.760 you have lots of food already in the  <br>00:31:02.279 digestive system so any sugar you put in  <br>00:31:05.159 afterwards is going to impact your  <br>00:31:06.639 glucose levels less you said that if I  <br>00:31:09.840 have something sweet for my breakfast  <br>00:31:11.240 I'm then going to be on a glucose roller  <br>00:31:12.760 coaster yeah why because glucose Spike  <br>00:31:17.320 then insulin comes out and your glucose  <br>00:31:19.720 drop then your glucose are low here you  <br>00:31:23.360 get really hungry you have a lot of  <br>00:31:24.960 cravings when our glucose levels are  <br>00:31:26.799 dropping scientists have shown it  <br>00:31:28.600 increases the activity of the craving  <br>00:31:30.279 Center in our brain so it goes like  <br>00:31:32.519 Stephen eat some sugar and you can't  <br>00:31:35.399 control that so what you do you reach  <br>00:31:37.440 for more sugar bam another glucose Spike  <br>00:31:40.399 and then you just continue your whole  <br>00:31:42.080 day like that so you sort of put  <br>00:31:44.399 yourself into a corner if you start your  <br>00:31:46.159 day with a spike and it's really  <br>00:31:47.639 difficult to get off that roller coaster  <br>00:31:50.000 does that roller coaster last across  <br>00:31:52.960 days good question generally during the  <br>00:31:55.760 night is sort of resets and my glucose  <br>00:31:58.279 test I saw that when I go to sleep it  <br>00:31:59.760 kind of flattens out kind of goes quite  <br>00:32:01.120 low at night time  <br>00:32:03.960 however I've got this unscientific  <br>00:32:06.679 observation where if I start if I had a  <br>00:32:09.360 carrot cake now um there's a high  <br>00:32:11.880 probability that I'd probably want to  <br>00:32:13.159 have a carrot cake by dinner time  <br>00:32:14.360 tonight as well and then when I wake up  <br>00:32:16.639 the next day I probably I'm going to be  <br>00:32:19.000 more likely to go for the carrot cake  <br>00:32:20.279 again and I if I if I zoomed out on my  <br>00:32:22.720 life say the whole 12 months of a year  <br>00:32:25.880 there will be maybe like this little  <br>00:32:28.279 week or two in clusters where maybe  <br>00:32:31.200 there's a couple of months in between  <br>00:32:32.240 and then there's this two we [ __ ]  <br>00:32:33.919 Splurge again where I find it really  <br>00:32:36.080 hard not to reach for something across  <br>00:32:38.399 multiple days now I'm not sure if this  <br>00:32:40.039 is in my head I think there's a few  <br>00:32:41.760 things going on one The Taste is really  <br>00:32:43.639 addictive so you get addicted to getting  <br>00:32:45.720 that taste and getting the dopamine  <br>00:32:47.159 don't forget there's the dopamine rush  <br>00:32:48.600 in your brain second with every glucose  <br>00:32:50.960 Spike you're actually deregulating your  <br>00:32:52.559 hunger hormones so you get you have more  <br>00:32:54.919 Cravings you're hungrier and yes this  <br>00:32:56.440 can totally last for a few days and I  <br>00:32:58.440 think thirdly if you have the carrot  <br>00:32:59.840 cake at home for a few days maybe you're  <br>00:33:01.720 just more likely to reach for it because  <br>00:33:02.960 it's there you know but I feel I feel  <br>00:33:04.679 similarly to you I have these phases  <br>00:33:07.480 especially if I'm really busy and I  <br>00:33:08.679 can't do all the hacks all the time  <br>00:33:10.279 where I'm eating a bunch of sugar and  <br>00:33:12.000 then it lasts until I say okay stop back  <br>00:33:14.519 on the hacks and I do the hacks for two  <br>00:33:16.039 days and then I'm good again that's the  <br>00:33:17.960 same with me but also I find that if I  <br>00:33:19.799 do a really big workout yeah for me it  <br>00:33:22.080 helps to break that cycle so if I this  <br>00:33:24.799 weekend I did a re I was I think I was  <br>00:33:26.279 in that cycle of like I wasn't reaching  <br>00:33:28.840 for sugar as in like something sweet I  <br>00:33:30.880 was reaching for like I was having a lot  <br>00:33:32.120 of like toast with my breakfast or I was  <br>00:33:33.880 having like carbs and then I did a  <br>00:33:36.240 really big workout and the last thing I  <br>00:33:37.880 wanted was anything with carbs in or  <br>00:33:39.720 glucose I think it's also in the brain  <br>00:33:41.399 you know cuz you're rebalancing those  <br>00:33:43.840 hormones that dopamine you're getting  <br>00:33:45.399 endorphins from the workout so you're  <br>00:33:47.320 not seeking all that pleasure from just  <br>00:33:49.399 sugar okay I think if you're in a cycle  <br>00:33:51.279 where all you're just getting dopamine  <br>00:33:52.919 from sugar it just becomes addictive and  <br>00:33:54.399 you have to do stuff in your life that  <br>00:33:55.840 allows you to feel good in your brain  <br>00:33:57.279 without having that sugar so maybe I got  <br>00:33:59.399 the dopamine from the workout instead  <br>00:34:01.559 totally and so I kind of shifted yeah  <br>00:34:04.200 the source of dopamine so that was the  <br>00:34:06.080 first hack which is Theory breakfast  <br>00:34:08.719 Super Key by the way if you just do one  <br>00:34:10.918 hack do this one it is a complete  <br>00:34:13.199 GameChanger and a Savory breakfast  <br>00:34:15.440 should keep you satiated for 4 hours  <br>00:34:18.199 which is a long time most people get  <br>00:34:20.480 hungry again 2 hours after they have  <br>00:34:22.839 breakfast so make sure you're having  <br>00:34:24.599 enough protein in your breakfast to stay  <br>00:34:26.199 full for four hours  <br>00:34:28.239 okay on that what if I fast totally fine  <br>00:34:31.679 make sure the first meal of your day is  <br>00:34:33.399 also Savory so it can be at 8 a.m. it  <br>00:34:35.520 can be at 4 P.M I do not care as long as  <br>00:34:38.159 the first thing that you eat is  <br>00:34:39.520 something Savory because when you're  <br>00:34:41.280 fasted your digestive system is super  <br>00:34:43.760 empty and sensitive so whatever you give  <br>00:34:46.000 it whether it's in the morning after  <br>00:34:47.440 just sleeping or whether it's after a  <br>00:34:48.918 two week fast is going to go really  <br>00:34:50.960 quickly into your bloodstream so you  <br>00:34:52.399 have to be cautious and make sure you're  <br>00:34:54.599 not giving your body glucose otherwise  <br>00:34:57.200 big [ __ ] do you think fasting is good  <br>00:35:00.240 for you inent  <br>00:35:02.520 fasting I think it's nuanced I think  <br>00:35:05.040 what I've seen is that in men it just  <br>00:35:07.079 works way better in females it can kind  <br>00:35:10.440 of mess up your hormones you have to be  <br>00:35:12.000 a bit um judicious about when you fast  <br>00:35:15.359 and we also have to remember guys  <br>00:35:17.480 fasting is a stressor on the body it is  <br>00:35:20.440 a good stressor but it is a stressor so  <br>00:35:23.520 if you have an intense job kids to take  <br>00:35:26.680 care of you drink coffee you have you  <br>00:35:29.119 know three times a week you do hit  <br>00:35:31.200 cardio then you do a sauna then you do a  <br>00:35:33.359 cul lunch then you fast your body is  <br>00:35:35.240 going to freak the [ __ ] out you have to  <br>00:35:36.960 like dose these stressors in a way that  <br>00:35:39.920 is going to be manageable for your body  <br>00:35:41.599 I see lots of women who do all those  <br>00:35:43.560 things I just mentioned and then they're  <br>00:35:45.160 like and I don't have my perod and I  <br>00:35:46.560 don't understand I don't feel good I'm  <br>00:35:47.960 like your body is freaking out like  <br>00:35:50.560 relax you can't be putting all these  <br>00:35:52.640 stressors on yourself all the time so I  <br>00:35:55.200 fast when I'm on vacation and what kind  <br>00:35:57.839 of fasting do you do I like we'll skip a  <br>00:35:59.880 meal we'll skip dinner we'll skip  <br>00:36:01.480 breakfast and it just helps your body  <br>00:36:03.599 clean up its dead cells and it's really  <br>00:36:05.520 helpful but we have to remember that  <br>00:36:08.800 fasting is a stressor it has great  <br>00:36:10.920 benefits but you don't have to fast in  <br>00:36:13.280 order to be healthy it's very important  <br>00:36:15.240 to also look at what you're eating  <br>00:36:17.000 because if you're fasting 16 hours a day  <br>00:36:19.400 and then you're just eating junk food  <br>00:36:21.200 it's not going to be helpful to your  <br>00:36:22.480 body we have to do both in combination  <br>00:36:24.839 do you fast naturally yeah so I haven't  <br>00:36:28.440 eaten today what time are we we 1:00 um  <br>00:36:31.280 and I won't eat until you've had a  <br>00:36:33.480 coffee I've had a coffee this morning  <br>00:36:36.119 yeah but I won't eat until what 400 p.m.  <br>00:36:39.000 5:00 p.m. which will be probably you  <br>00:36:40.839 know after I get back to the office and  <br>00:36:42.400 stuff like that you feel good I feel  <br>00:36:43.880 fine so that's the thing right my  <br>00:36:45.760 recommendation is if you feel great Fab  <br>00:36:48.119 if you feel stressed out if you feel  <br>00:36:49.520 light-headed if it feels hard yeah then  <br>00:36:51.800 don't do it your body can't handle it  <br>00:36:53.000 just doesn't cross my mind to eat I  <br>00:36:54.319 don't know how people eat it's amazing  <br>00:36:56.040 yeah then go for it live your life Man  <br>00:36:58.560 live your life Stephen what about  <br>00:36:59.720 calorie restriction do you think much  <br>00:37:01.000 about that I mean it works right if you  <br>00:37:03.079 if few calories you're going to lose  <br>00:37:05.760 weight but this is one of my favorite  <br>00:37:08.079 stories do you know how calories were  <br>00:37:11.520 invented maybe okay they like put it in  <br>00:37:13.880 a box and burnt it they put yes I I told  <br>00:37:16.160 you that yes so back in the day to  <br>00:37:18.880 measure calories what do you want to  <br>00:37:20.079 measure the calorie of tell me something  <br>00:37:21.920 some my food car cake  <br>00:37:24.319 okay okay so if we were back in the day  <br>00:37:26.800 like 100 years ago and we wanted to  <br>00:37:28.040 measure the calories in your carrot cake  <br>00:37:29.680 here's what we would do we would take  <br>00:37:31.119 the carrot cake put it in a box then put  <br>00:37:33.760 this box in an aquarium filled with  <br>00:37:36.680 water so you have the aquarium and then  <br>00:37:39.520 inside you have the box with the carrot  <br>00:37:40.920 cake then we would light the carrot cake  <br>00:37:43.720 on fire inside the small box and measure  <br>00:37:47.160 by how many degrees the water in the  <br>00:37:49.520 aquarium increased in temperature so  <br>00:37:52.599 we're just measuring the heat that is  <br>00:37:56.079 created when we burn the carrot cake  <br>00:37:58.880 that is how we measure calories by how  <br>00:38:01.319 much heat is generated when you burn a  <br>00:38:03.319 food so if you were to put in that same  <br>00:38:05.480 box I don't know three avocados and you  <br>00:38:07.760 burnt them you might get the same  <br>00:38:10.000 temperature increase in the water so you  <br>00:38:11.440 might say oh this carrot cake and these  <br>00:38:12.920 three avocados have the same number of  <br>00:38:14.760 calories but the thing is with the  <br>00:38:16.280 calorie thing it's not actually telling  <br>00:38:18.119 you what's in the food it's just  <br>00:38:20.400 measuring energy that dissipated when  <br>00:38:22.839 you burnt it it's not telling you the  <br>00:38:25.079 carrot cake is going to lead to a big  <br>00:38:26.680 glucose Spike going to make you inflamed  <br>00:38:28.960 age faster release insulin whereas the  <br>00:38:31.079 three avocados will keep you steady and  <br>00:38:32.680 feeling better so two people can be  <br>00:38:35.160 eating 2,000 calories diets one person  <br>00:38:38.480 can be eating in a way that keeps their  <br>00:38:39.960 glucose nice and steady they feel good  <br>00:38:42.480 good energy F Cravings clear brain not  <br>00:38:45.599 super hungry all the time the other  <br>00:38:47.440 person can be eating just glucose  <br>00:38:49.000 spiking food and they're having a  <br>00:38:50.240 terrible time they're hungry constantly  <br>00:38:52.560 they have cravings brain fog insulin  <br>00:38:54.400 release so calories are interesting but  <br>00:38:57.160 they're not not everything we need to  <br>00:38:58.240 teach people about the molecules in  <br>00:38:59.760 their food I find that to be a much  <br>00:39:01.960 easier way to try to eat a bit less if  <br>00:39:04.000 you're trying to lose some fat is to  <br>00:39:06.160 just focus on your glucose levels  <br>00:39:07.440 because naturally your hunger hormones  <br>00:39:09.760 will rebalance you'll have few cravings  <br>00:39:11.359 and it's much easier to eat less is  <br>00:39:14.280 there a story that you've been sent or a  <br>00:39:16.240 case study from someone that's followed  <br>00:39:17.880 your work that's stuck with you someone  <br>00:39:20.040 that's understood their glucose and had  <br>00:39:21.760 a big shift in their life I imagine  <br>00:39:23.119 there's thousands but yeah there's many  <br>00:39:26.359 many I think for there's two things for  <br>00:39:28.720 me there's the the pregnancy stories  <br>00:39:30.839 because I think that's so touching  <br>00:39:31.920 because I've had many friends go through  <br>00:39:33.920 difficult fertility Journeys and to hear  <br>00:39:36.319 people who were about to embark on  <br>00:39:38.400 really intense fertility treatments and  <br>00:39:39.960 just tried this and then got pregnant I  <br>00:39:41.319 think that's really cool and then second  <br>00:39:43.400 I think it's the people  <br>00:39:45.040 whom there was this one guy he's had  <br>00:39:47.720 diabetes his whole life he's like in his  <br>00:39:49.400 50s um on lots of medication and just  <br>00:39:53.079 thought he would lose a leg and lose his  <br>00:39:55.040 vision that's what happens when you have  <br>00:39:56.240 type two for a very long time  <br>00:39:58.079 and the thing is his doctors had never  <br>00:39:59.720 explained to him why he had diabetes  <br>00:40:01.720 they had just told him you know take  <br>00:40:02.880 this pill and I take this insulin and he  <br>00:40:05.520 read my book and he understood why he  <br>00:40:07.720 got diabetes in the first place and he  <br>00:40:10.480 did the hacks he was able to reverse his  <br>00:40:12.640 type two diabetes in one year all his  <br>00:40:15.000 doctors were like how did you do it you  <br>00:40:16.960 know doctors don't often have this kind  <br>00:40:18.599 of information and then he sent me a  <br>00:40:20.520 long message saying now I'll be able to  <br>00:40:22.280 see my grandkid wedding and I really  <br>00:40:23.920 thank you for that it's so cute you know  <br>00:40:27.000 we're all we're all stuck in this  <br>00:40:29.960 vicious cycle of having this toxic food  <br>00:40:32.079 around us that's making us sick but not  <br>00:40:34.800 understanding how to get out of it and  <br>00:40:36.760 everybody wants to be healthy that man  <br>00:40:39.359 he was eating stuff that he thought  <br>00:40:41.119 would be good for him he was eating like  <br>00:40:43.119 the low calorie rice cakes and the fruit  <br>00:40:46.079 smoothies and the lowfat yogurts and all  <br>00:40:48.599 these things trying to be healthier but  <br>00:40:51.280 if you don't have the right information  <br>00:40:52.680 you can't actually make a change what  <br>00:40:55.640 would you say to parents it's it's  <br>00:40:57.680 really interesting cuz I I've had the  <br>00:40:59.520 experience of watching a lot of early  <br>00:41:01.000 parents over the last couple of months  <br>00:41:02.680 and um they care so much about their  <br>00:41:06.240 kids just eating it something that often  <br>00:41:08.839 they'll give them something that is high  <br>00:41:10.319 in glucose does it matter you know  <br>00:41:13.200 because sometimes people look at kids  <br>00:41:14.240 and go well they're a kid they they'll  <br>00:41:16.000 kind of it won't have an impact on them  <br>00:41:18.160 they'll kind of grow out of it yeah well  <br>00:41:20.240 we'll make sure that they eat healthy  <br>00:41:21.400 later we just need to make sure they eat  <br>00:41:22.839 something now listen we used to think  <br>00:41:25.520 type two diabetes was a disease is  <br>00:41:27.480 reserved for adults and now 5-year-olds  <br>00:41:29.240 get it it's very important to help your  <br>00:41:31.560 kids eat well so that they set up their  <br>00:41:33.720 body in a healthy way one thing that I  <br>00:41:35.640 hear is yeah Jesse I know I should be  <br>00:41:37.400 giving my kids eggs in the morning but  <br>00:41:40.040 they just keep begging for the cereal  <br>00:41:41.640 and I just I can't say no you know they  <br>00:41:43.760 they won't they won't let go I have to  <br>00:41:45.760 give it to them and I say what if they  <br>00:41:47.640 were begging you for  <br>00:41:49.280 cigarettes would you give them the  <br>00:41:51.359 cigarettes like you don't actually have  <br>00:41:53.800 to give your kids this food it's hard  <br>00:41:56.960 for for sure but if it's a priority for  <br>00:41:59.319 you you can totally do it absolutely and  <br>00:42:01.960 I think it's important to set an example  <br>00:42:04.839 actually because if you're having cereal  <br>00:42:06.440 and orange juice it's going to be really  <br>00:42:07.720 hard for your kids to take you seriously  <br>00:42:09.400 like come on dad like you know shut up  <br>00:42:12.200 what you think of giving kids orange  <br>00:42:13.440 juice oh my God it's terrible it's the  <br>00:42:15.240 worst it's it's it's just terrible it's  <br>00:42:17.960 big rush of sugar can affect it can  <br>00:42:20.319 affect Behavior you know tantrums and  <br>00:42:23.160 the sugar cravings and the sugar lows I  <br>00:42:26.400 mean no it's terrible it breaks my heart  <br>00:42:28.880 I'm like wow those little bodies are not  <br>00:42:31.200 happy right now you know there's so many  <br>00:42:33.920 parents that are listening right now  <br>00:42:35.800 like you don't [ __ ] get it you too  <br>00:42:38.400 childless better totally and that's why  <br>00:42:40.599 Stephen you know when I have kids I  <br>00:42:42.280 totally want to write a book about that  <br>00:42:43.559 because I think there's lots of stuff we  <br>00:42:44.559 can teach a parents about how to feed  <br>00:42:47.040 their kids it's too easy for me to say  <br>00:42:49.079 this stuff I don't have kids I don't  <br>00:42:50.119 know how it is but I can tell you one  <br>00:42:51.559 thing there will be no orange juice in  <br>00:42:53.960 my house no orange juice like my mom my  <br>00:42:57.319 mom was addicted to diet coke when she  <br>00:42:58.839 was younger so we never had soda in our  <br>00:43:00.680 house never and I hate I hate soda now I  <br>00:43:03.359 would never be able to drink any of that  <br>00:43:05.240 stuff because it was never I never  <br>00:43:06.839 learned to like it so don't be scared  <br>00:43:09.040 that your kid is going to binge if you  <br>00:43:11.040 restrict all the sugary stuff I think  <br>00:43:12.559 it's the opposite I think if you don't  <br>00:43:13.920 give them the Habit they just won't have  <br>00:43:15.240 the habit I do agree we we um we didn't  <br>00:43:17.880 have many sweet things or fizzy drinks  <br>00:43:20.960 or anything in in the house and I think  <br>00:43:22.400 as a kid I was resentful because you  <br>00:43:24.359 you'd go to school and you'd see those  <br>00:43:25.640 things you you'd lean towards them and  <br>00:43:27.319 you'd love them at school but frankly as  <br>00:43:29.079 I've grown older I'm completely cool  <br>00:43:30.920 with just drinking water all the time  <br>00:43:33.200 that's part partly because that's what  <br>00:43:34.480 we had in the house so my relationship  <br>00:43:36.160 with water is pretty strong I feel you  <br>00:43:38.280 but you know one thing that parents do  <br>00:43:39.599 tell me is that when they do their  <br>00:43:40.680 glucose hacks and they manage their  <br>00:43:42.280 glucose levels they're able to be more  <br>00:43:43.960 Zen around their kids and sort of you  <br>00:43:46.079 know stay a bit more um centered when  <br>00:43:49.040 their kids are freaking out or asking  <br>00:43:50.520 about something a lot their their mood  <br>00:43:52.400 is steadier so they can actually make  <br>00:43:53.920 better choices for the whole family and  <br>00:43:55.280 they have a bit more stamina and uh then  <br>00:43:57.960 their kids do the hacks and their kids  <br>00:44:01.079 get calmer and then the family is just  <br>00:44:02.880 having a better time generally but it  <br>00:44:05.079 can really  <br>00:44:06.319 impact even a marriage this a great  <br>00:44:08.520 study I have to tell you about that was  <br>00:44:10.680 looking at married couples so they  <br>00:44:12.559 recruited 300 married couples and bless  <br>00:44:15.160 these scientists they're just insane so  <br>00:44:17.400 they recruited 300 married couples they  <br>00:44:20.000 gave each person in the marriage a  <br>00:44:22.640 voodoo doll representing their spouse so  <br>00:44:26.680 if you're in a marriage you have a  <br>00:44:27.880 voodoo doll representing your husband or  <br>00:44:29.400 your wife scientists then asked the  <br>00:44:32.400 people to put a pin in the voodo doll  <br>00:44:36.440 representing their spouse every time  <br>00:44:38.319 their spouse annoyed them for six weeks  <br>00:44:42.400 at the end of the study they took all  <br>00:44:43.839 the voodoo dolls counted the pins they  <br>00:44:45.839 also measured the participants glucose  <br>00:44:48.520 levels what they found Stephen is that  <br>00:44:51.960 those who had more variable glucose  <br>00:44:54.400 levels specifically those who had more  <br>00:44:56.160 low glucose level events which happens  <br>00:44:58.440 after spikes had put more pins in the  <br>00:45:02.520 voodoo doll representing their spouse so  <br>00:45:05.359 their glucose levels seem to be linked  <br>00:45:07.240 to how irritated they were with their  <br>00:45:09.079 partner and then the scientists  <br>00:45:10.880 speculated that this had to do with a  <br>00:45:13.000 neurotransmitter called tyrosine and the  <br>00:45:15.280 more glucose roller coaster you have  <br>00:45:17.119 going on the lower your tyrosine levels  <br>00:45:19.440 and tyrosine balances our mood so the  <br>00:45:22.599 food you eat can impact your marriage  <br>00:45:25.480 can impact how you show up  <br>00:45:27.640 with others can impact how you feel  <br>00:45:30.160 about other people's behavior it goes  <br>00:45:32.079 really deep it's not just about diabetes  <br>00:45:34.559 it it impacts who you are as a person  <br>00:45:36.559 your personality so if I stop eating  <br>00:45:38.680 sugar it will save my marriage I mean  <br>00:45:41.200 you said  <br>00:45:43.079 it it's not it's really interesting I  <br>00:45:45.040 was thinking as you were talking as well  <br>00:45:46.240 about how glucose is linked to our sort  <br>00:45:51.240 of discipline more broadly you know you  <br>00:45:53.839 were talking earlier about parents and  <br>00:45:55.559 them being able to be more sort of  <br>00:45:56.599 disciplined and strict with and calm  <br>00:46:00.119 when they themselves get their glucose  <br>00:46:02.000 under control but you think about all of  <br>00:46:03.359 our lives our lives are shaped by the  <br>00:46:04.760 habits that we perform consistently and  <br>00:46:06.680 for us to have good um habits that are  <br>00:46:10.000 prod conducive with our health our  <br>00:46:12.480 happiness our success then we need to be  <br>00:46:15.240 focused and disciplined and be able to  <br>00:46:17.000 reach for the right things um whether  <br>00:46:19.240 it's a dumbbell or whether it's our  <br>00:46:21.160 laptop yeah so like do do you ever think  <br>00:46:23.599 much about the role that glucose plays  <br>00:46:25.200 with our sort of discipline to be who we  <br>00:46:27.079 want to be to sh up how we want to sh up  <br>00:46:28.680 completely because so many people are  <br>00:46:30.520 stuck in a cycle of being a victim to  <br>00:46:33.079 their Cravings being a victim to their  <br>00:46:34.599 fatigue and they can't show up as the  <br>00:46:36.440 person they want to be and if you switch  <br>00:46:39.599 your diet and use these hacks you can  <br>00:46:42.079 actually be more connected to the  <br>00:46:44.079 version of yourself that you want to be  <br>00:46:45.920 and even just a simple thing like a  <br>00:46:47.200 Savory breakfast it can deeply change  <br>00:46:49.960 how you show up throughout your day  <br>00:46:52.280 instead of being exhausted at 11:00 a.m.  <br>00:46:55.160 needing four coffees feeling this  <br>00:46:56.920 lethargic in your work meeting then at 3  <br>00:46:59.040 p.m. thinking oh I really want to have a  <br>00:47:00.640 nap I would have a nap on the floor  <br>00:47:02.000 right here if I could looking for sugar  <br>00:47:03.839 all the time you actually have a clearer  <br>00:47:05.680 brain like we know glucose spikes are  <br>00:47:07.440 linked to even just brain fog and brain  <br>00:47:09.680 fog is a debilitating symptom to have  <br>00:47:12.440 you can't show up as the person you want  <br>00:47:14.559 to be I would never be able to do the  <br>00:47:16.160 work that I do if I didn't have my  <br>00:47:17.960 glucose under control and I learned that  <br>00:47:19.800 from the very beginning that's why I got  <br>00:47:21.119 into this work in the first place but  <br>00:47:23.200 100% agree with you yeah so the first  <br>00:47:25.839 hack we talked about was the Savory  <br>00:47:27.839 breakfast there was the second one you  <br>00:47:29.040 talked about vinegar which we talked  <br>00:47:30.280 about last time which I remember I was  <br>00:47:31.440 really repulsed by but you count this as  <br>00:47:33.680 one of your most important hacks is to  <br>00:47:36.319 eat vinegar every day it's drink one  <br>00:47:38.480 tablespoon of vinegar in a big glass of  <br>00:47:40.319 water before your biggest meal of the  <br>00:47:42.440 day and the reason it's important  <br>00:47:43.599 Stephen is because it's easy and I'm all  <br>00:47:45.960 about easy hacks big bang for your bck  <br>00:47:48.720 so vinegar contains acetic acid which  <br>00:47:51.640 interacts with your digestive enzymes  <br>00:47:53.680 and cuts the glucose Spike of your meal  <br>00:47:55.440 by up to 30% with no effort so if you  <br>00:47:58.280 want a super low effort albeit not very  <br>00:48:01.040 delicious super low effort hack to try  <br>00:48:03.800 do that and see how you feel with a  <br>00:48:06.480 smaller Spike and a smaller crash few  <br>00:48:08.559 Cravings less fatigue what kind of  <br>00:48:10.440 vinegar any kind of vinegar it can be  <br>00:48:12.680 the vinegar you have at home literally  <br>00:48:14.079 tonight just grab the white vinegar in  <br>00:48:16.319 your kitchen and not the cleaning  <br>00:48:17.640 vinegar if it's next to the toilet paper  <br>00:48:19.079 it's not the right vinegar you want the  <br>00:48:20.800 kitchen vinegar one tablespoon in a big  <br>00:48:23.079 glass of water dilute it drink it 10  <br>00:48:25.079 minutes before having your dinner see  <br>00:48:26.440 how you feel what's what role is the  <br>00:48:28.079 water playing in this just dilution so  <br>00:48:30.520 that it doesn't hurt your teeth because  <br>00:48:32.280 your dentist won't be very happy if you  <br>00:48:34.240 take a shot of vinegar because it can  <br>00:48:35.520 hurt your teeth's enamel okay so that's  <br>00:48:38.240 hack number two and that's really to  <br>00:48:39.640 sort of line my stomach to so no that's  <br>00:48:42.800 to interact with your digestive enzymes  <br>00:48:44.960 the line stomach is the third hack which  <br>00:48:46.960 is Veggie starters so all around the  <br>00:48:49.640 world if you look at different cultures  <br>00:48:51.160 you see this habit this tradition of  <br>00:48:53.440 starting your meal with veggies in Italy  <br>00:48:56.160 aunti  <br>00:48:57.359 in France crud raw vegetables at the end  <br>00:49:00.359 of your at the beginning of your meal in  <br>00:49:02.200 the Middle East you start your meals  <br>00:49:04.119 with herbs by the bunch right why are we  <br>00:49:07.319 doing this veggies first thing well  <br>00:49:09.559 recently scientists have discovered why  <br>00:49:11.040 it's so powerful it's because veggies  <br>00:49:13.520 contain fiber we love fiber she's the  <br>00:49:16.760 best when you have fiber at the  <br>00:49:18.480 beginning of a meal what it does is that  <br>00:49:20.359 it coats your intestine it makes this  <br>00:49:22.440 sort of protective barrier this  <br>00:49:24.960 protective mesh kind of goo fibrous mesh  <br>00:49:28.720 and so any glucose you eat afterwards  <br>00:49:31.400 will not be able to go through your  <br>00:49:33.839 intestine into your bloodstream so  <br>00:49:35.680 quickly so it slows down the arrival of  <br>00:49:38.040 glucose into your blood and it slows  <br>00:49:40.079 down that Spike you can make the  <br>00:49:42.119 experiment if you're wearing a monitor  <br>00:49:44.359 just have a a small plate of you know  <br>00:49:47.240 carrots or spinach or broccoli or cherry  <br>00:49:49.280 tomatoes or whatever veggie you like  <br>00:49:51.160 before a meal and see how much smaller  <br>00:49:53.000 your glucose spike is you stay Fuller  <br>00:49:55.359 for longer have few crat and you're  <br>00:49:57.200 helping your body from within too and  <br>00:49:59.559 the fourth one you mentioned was moving  <br>00:50:01.440 after after eating yeah so after eating  <br>00:50:05.240 use your body and your muscles for 10  <br>00:50:07.200 minutes you can clean your apartment go  <br>00:50:10.319 for a walk with your dog dance to a few  <br>00:50:12.680 songs if you're at the office you can do  <br>00:50:15.240 calf raises under your desk like this so  <br>00:50:17.200 you just sort of push up onto the balls  <br>00:50:18.920 of your feet up and down for 10 minutes  <br>00:50:20.960 nobody will see and your calves contain  <br>00:50:23.559 a muscle called the Solus muscle which  <br>00:50:25.240 is really good at soaking up glucose but  <br>00:50:27.559 it's what we were talking about earlier  <br>00:50:28.839 Stephen your muscles are really  <br>00:50:31.000 effective glucose dumps and the more you  <br>00:50:33.119 use them to contract the more they're  <br>00:50:34.920 going to soak up glucose from your  <br>00:50:36.520 bloodstream to use for energy so that's  <br>00:50:39.400 the four hacks Savory breakfast vinegar  <br>00:50:42.119 once a day veggie starter once a day you  <br>00:50:44.319 can also combine those two and do like a  <br>00:50:46.599 vinegar dressing on a veggie starter and  <br>00:50:49.319 then moving after eating and then when  <br>00:50:51.200 you want to get Pro you go to all my  <br>00:50:52.480 other hacks people talk about being in a  <br>00:50:54.240 food comr after they've eaten yeah which  <br>00:50:56.640 which is I mean the antithesis of what  <br>00:50:58.040 you're you're saying absolutely food  <br>00:51:00.520 coma is like a combination of brain fog  <br>00:51:02.119 and fatigue right and what's going on  <br>00:51:04.200 there well I think there's a lot of  <br>00:51:06.000 things going on but one study that's  <br>00:51:07.520 really interesting shows us that in rats  <br>00:51:10.839 when you create lots of big glucose  <br>00:51:12.839 spikes and when you monitor the activity  <br>00:51:15.040 of their neurons in the rats scientists  <br>00:51:17.480 noticed that the more glucose spikes  <br>00:51:19.400 they had the slower the speed of the  <br>00:51:23.440 signal between their neurons so their  <br>00:51:25.799 brain was literally slowing down the  <br>00:51:28.960 information was going more slowly  <br>00:51:31.000 throughout the brain and they're the  <br>00:51:32.400 they theorized that in humans this could  <br>00:51:34.440 lead to brain fog so you have glucose  <br>00:51:36.799 spikes linked to brain fog and your  <br>00:51:39.079 mitochondria becoming exhausted from Big  <br>00:51:41.720 glucose spikes potentially making you  <br>00:51:43.839 really tired you know 90 minutes after  <br>00:51:45.640 eating with the hack food coma reduced  <br>00:51:49.079 significantly so you can actually do  <br>00:51:50.839 stuff after eating instead of just being  <br>00:51:53.119 lying down and not being able to get up  <br>00:51:55.960 and you took these hacks and you did an  <br>00:51:57.920 experiment right on page seven of your  <br>00:52:00.640 book the glucose goddess  <br>00:52:03.440 method you talk about this 2,700 person  <br>00:52:07.040 pilot experiment that you did in 2019  <br>00:52:10.599 yeah which of the hacks did you use for  <br>00:52:13.000 this experiment and what did you find so  <br>00:52:15.040 it was these four hacks so it was a  <br>00:52:16.720 four-week experiment week one you start  <br>00:52:19.480 your Savory breakfast every day you do  <br>00:52:21.559 that for the four weeks week two you add  <br>00:52:24.160 in vinegar once a day you continue for  <br>00:52:26.520 for the rest of the three weeks week  <br>00:52:28.240 three you add veggie starters and week  <br>00:52:30.079 four you add moving after eating you  <br>00:52:33.040 don't have to change anything else about  <br>00:52:34.799 what you're eating I'm not cutting out  <br>00:52:36.599 sugar I'm not telling you to not drink  <br>00:52:38.280 alcohol I'm not telling you to not drink  <br>00:52:39.559 pasta I'm just asking you to add these  <br>00:52:42.200 for hacks in and see what happens and  <br>00:52:45.440 these people were from 110 countries  <br>00:52:47.559 yeah I recruited I recruited them online  <br>00:52:49.760 on through Instagram between the ages of  <br>00:52:51.799 20 and 70 years old mhm and what  <br>00:52:55.160 happened listen the results were really  <br>00:52:57.520 stunning so 90% of people reduced their  <br>00:52:59.799 Cravings 90% of people had more energy  <br>00:53:02.160 you had really significant impacts on  <br>00:53:04.040 sleep on hormones on skin on mood on  <br>00:53:08.400 Diabetes I mean of course this is not a  <br>00:53:11.119 you know Placebo controlled randomized  <br>00:53:13.200 trial it's just an experiment I didn't  <br>00:53:15.079 have a control group but these numbers  <br>00:53:17.400 are pretty remarkable and that's what I  <br>00:53:19.359 see when I meet people when I see the  <br>00:53:21.400 testimonials from my readers so just  <br>00:53:23.520 very quick impact because glucose spikes  <br>00:53:26.240 imp act all parts of our system physical  <br>00:53:29.799 and mental and when you balance them  <br>00:53:31.400 Stephen you're creating a much better  <br>00:53:33.559 foundation for your body and your mind  <br>00:53:36.079 to be healthy and these are  <br>00:53:37.640 self-reported symptoms right totally  <br>00:53:39.240 yeah so we did a survey at the end of  <br>00:53:41.240 every of the four weeks and uh just  <br>00:53:43.599 measured the results and when you say  <br>00:53:46.200 there's no control group that means that  <br>00:53:48.440 there wasn't another group who weren't  <br>00:53:50.960 who were doing like a different kind of  <br>00:53:52.760 intervention or Placebo no okay so it  <br>00:53:54.960 was just 3,000 people doing the hacks  <br>00:53:57.240 and I was just asking them questions uh  <br>00:53:59.680 at the end and it says here 40% roughly  <br>00:54:02.000 40% of people who wanted to lose weight  <br>00:54:03.680 did in fact lose weight in those four  <br>00:54:05.040 weeks yeah with no calorie restriction  <br>00:54:07.680 no request to eat less and the reason  <br>00:54:11.400 this is interesting is that even though  <br>00:54:13.200 weight loss is not the primary objective  <br>00:54:15.359 of balancing your glucose levels what  <br>00:54:17.400 happens when you reduce your spikes is  <br>00:54:19.799 that you reduce Cravings because you're  <br>00:54:21.760 not activating that craving Center  <br>00:54:23.319 anymore you reduce hunger you have more  <br>00:54:25.799 energy to potentially move more and you  <br>00:54:28.839 lower your insulin levels now this is  <br>00:54:30.920 very important because when there's  <br>00:54:32.480 insulin present in your body you cannot  <br>00:54:34.799 burn fat insulin is storing fat and  <br>00:54:38.240 making more fat and when you lower  <br>00:54:40.520 insulin you can actually burn some of  <br>00:54:42.760 the fat that you stored and there's  <br>00:54:44.799 going to be people screaming because  <br>00:54:45.799 they want to know the other sort of six  <br>00:54:47.680 this 10 right yeah I can go through all  <br>00:54:49.400 of them if you want sit the other six AR  <br>00:54:51.839 of course of course of course so another  <br>00:54:54.359 hack is eating your food in the right  <br>00:54:56.799 now this is kind of similar to the  <br>00:54:58.440 veggie starter it's just a bit more  <br>00:55:00.280 complicated and it's really where the  <br>00:55:02.119 science it's really what the science  <br>00:55:03.960 shows us the science shows us that if  <br>00:55:06.400 you eat a meal in the right order  <br>00:55:08.280 meaning veggies first then proteins and  <br>00:55:11.559 fats then starches and sugars instead of  <br>00:55:14.480 the opposite you reduce the glucose  <br>00:55:16.400 Spike of the meal by up to  <br>00:55:18.559 75% you're eating the same meal the same  <br>00:55:22.440 quantity the same food just the order  <br>00:55:24.480 and using that fiber first mentality  <br>00:55:26.920 is going to reduce your Spike  <br>00:55:28.559 significantly just to be clear this  <br>00:55:29.680 doesn't mean that I'm going to gain less  <br>00:55:31.799 weight from that  <br>00:55:33.520 meal well no because it doesn't H you  <br>00:55:36.039 know weight loss doesn't happen within  <br>00:55:37.559 one specific meal but it does mean  <br>00:55:39.359 you'll have fewer Cravings a couple  <br>00:55:41.079 hours after that meal so maybe you won't  <br>00:55:42.680 reach for the donut okay that's how it  <br>00:55:44.680 would work so indirectly I might not  <br>00:55:46.520 game more away exactly exactly so eating  <br>00:55:49.520 your food in the right order okay having  <br>00:55:51.880 a Savory breakfast we talked about it  <br>00:55:54.000 veggies first we talked about it vinegar  <br>00:55:56.520 we talked about it moving after eating  <br>00:55:57.799 we talked about it and then there's  <br>00:55:58.920 clothes on  <br>00:56:00.119 carbs so that means anytime you eat  <br>00:56:03.119 starches or sugars which are the big  <br>00:56:05.280 category of carbs make sure you're never  <br>00:56:07.280 eating them naked or on their own  <br>00:56:10.960 because if you eat them on their own  <br>00:56:13.400 plof they just turn into glucose really  <br>00:56:15.200 really quickly so instead of having a  <br>00:56:16.480 slice of bread on its own have bread and  <br>00:56:19.039 some avocado add some fat to that that's  <br>00:56:21.640 a good clothing to add or add some  <br>00:56:23.440 protein or add some Fiber if you're  <br>00:56:25.119 having a carrot cake don't have it on  <br>00:56:27.280 its own have it with a Greek yogurt for  <br>00:56:29.480 example so that's clothes on carbs it's  <br>00:56:33.839 really easy to remember especially if  <br>00:56:36.599 you're going throughout your day and you  <br>00:56:37.839 can't really pick what you're eating  <br>00:56:39.440 because you don't have many options just  <br>00:56:40.760 think clothes on carbs then we have  <br>00:56:43.119 Savory  <br>00:56:44.240 snacks so during a day if you want to  <br>00:56:46.920 have a snack between meals when your  <br>00:56:49.039 stomach is empty try to have something  <br>00:56:51.280 Savory that won't increase your glucose  <br>00:56:53.440 spikes instead of having something sweet  <br>00:56:56.760 then another hack that we kind of  <br>00:56:57.920 touched on is if you want to eat  <br>00:57:00.119 something sweet have it as dessert  <br>00:57:02.400 instead of on an empty stomach so if I  <br>00:57:04.359 want a cookie or a carrot cake I will  <br>00:57:06.319 make sure to buy it in the morning if I  <br>00:57:07.880 know where I want to get it from and  <br>00:57:08.960 then have it as dessert after my lunch  <br>00:57:10.839 or after my dinner so I'm not removing  <br>00:57:13.880 any of the sugar from your life I'm just  <br>00:57:15.960 showing you how and when to eat it so it  <br>00:57:18.720 will reduce the glucose Spike and then  <br>00:57:21.000 we have always eat your fruit whole  <br>00:57:23.720 never Juiced never dried never smoothed  <br>00:57:26.920 only whole to have that protective fiber  <br>00:57:29.200 in there thinking about your Instagram  <br>00:57:32.079 you post these photos of glucose spikes  <br>00:57:33.920 with um in response to different foods  <br>00:57:35.920 how do you trial that is that oh great  <br>00:57:38.319 question are those your spikes yeah  <br>00:57:40.039 those are my spikes or the spikes from  <br>00:57:41.480 somebody on my team but it's really  <br>00:57:42.799 important to note that these spikes are  <br>00:57:46.119 just  <br>00:57:46.920 illustrating studies trials that have  <br>00:57:49.520 been done by scientists around the world  <br>00:57:51.000 so for example I'll find a clinical  <br>00:57:52.960 trial showing that vinegar before a meal  <br>00:57:55.079 reduces a glucose Spike it's been shown  <br>00:57:57.039 at scale with a placebo you know proper  <br>00:57:59.799 clinical study and I'll just make an  <br>00:58:02.000 example with my own data to illustrate  <br>00:58:04.799 that scientific study and that's why if  <br>00:58:06.599 you swipe on my post you'll see my graph  <br>00:58:08.799 and then the study that I mentioned or  <br>00:58:10.200 in the description of the post I don't  <br>00:58:12.280 draw any conclusions from my own glucose  <br>00:58:14.400 data I'm not like oh look today I had a  <br>00:58:16.880 green tea and that didn't cause a spike  <br>00:58:18.359 and yesterday I had a green tea and I  <br>00:58:19.760 also had a piece of I don't know  <br>00:58:21.119 whatever an almond and that caused a  <br>00:58:23.160 biggest [ __ ] so I should be telling  <br>00:58:25.160 everybody to not have elments like  <br>00:58:26.640 that's not how it works at all it's just  <br>00:58:28.720 an illustration of existing studies  <br>00:58:30.960 that's my role that's my job that's what  <br>00:58:32.319 I love to do to translate studies that  <br>00:58:34.440 are existing in a way that makes it  <br>00:58:37.440 easier for people to understand because  <br>00:58:39.240 you can't just give somebody a  <br>00:58:41.400 scientific paper you have to explain it  <br>00:58:44.039 in a visual way that they can  <br>00:58:45.839 immediately get it so of those visuals  <br>00:58:49.200 that you've made is there some in  <br>00:58:52.280 particular that were most surprising to  <br>00:58:53.920 you or most shocking to you because I'm  <br>00:58:55.200 going to put some of them on the screen  <br>00:58:56.720 so some of them that come to mind that  <br>00:58:58.280 would maybe had the biggest response  <br>00:59:01.000 from your audience for example yeah I  <br>00:59:03.480 think some of the ones that show  <br>00:59:04.960 traditional food combinations and how  <br>00:59:06.559 they're actually good for our glucose  <br>00:59:07.760 levels are fascinating for example  <br>00:59:09.720 grapes and cheese so I'm French and  <br>00:59:12.400 often when you eat like a big uh plateau  <br>00:59:15.119 of cheese you'll have some grapes there  <br>00:59:16.559 to have with and it you know the glucose  <br>00:59:19.039 response shows us that if we had the  <br>00:59:20.359 grape on its own it would be a bigger  <br>00:59:22.280 Spike than the grape with the cheese not  <br>00:59:24.319 only is it really delicious it's Al  <br>00:59:26.280 better for your glucose levels because  <br>00:59:27.480 you're putting clothing on that sugary  <br>00:59:29.799 carb that is the piece of fruit or ham  <br>00:59:33.880 and melon or rice and beans all these  <br>00:59:37.359 traditional combinations cause smaller  <br>00:59:40.039 spikes than you would expect from the  <br>00:59:41.799 individual ingredients that's really  <br>00:59:43.920 quite fascinating in terms of the most  <br>00:59:46.400 um shocking ones I think  <br>00:59:48.760 any glucose graph showing food order is  <br>00:59:52.559 really interesting so for example if you  <br>00:59:54.280 have salad and then then pasta which is  <br>00:59:57.640 much better for your glucose levels than  <br>00:59:59.359 having pasta and then the salad  <br>01:00:01.880 interesting yeah and that's the food  <br>01:00:03.240 order hack going on do you know off the  <br>01:00:06.440 top of your head what your most engaged  <br>01:00:08.960 post has been of all time the one that's  <br>01:00:10.920 been shared the most or commented on the  <br>01:00:12.359 most um actually it's one currently at  <br>01:00:15.640 least on YouTube it's one where I  <br>01:00:17.280 explain where I show an image of an  <br>01:00:19.440 ancestral banana what bananas used to  <br>01:00:21.960 actually look like in nature and what  <br>01:00:24.319 bananas look like today to illustrate  <br>01:00:26.000 that the fruit that you find today in  <br>01:00:27.160 the supermarket is not natural so that's  <br>01:00:30.160 a very very popular one and then I think  <br>01:00:32.280 it's the hacks um it's the glucose  <br>01:00:34.960 graphs and the videos where I explain  <br>01:00:36.280 food order people really love that it's  <br>01:00:38.480 so interesting to see that if you have  <br>01:00:41.839 your veggies at the beginning of a meal  <br>01:00:43.559 you have such a big impact on your  <br>01:00:45.520 glucose levels whereas we've all been  <br>01:00:47.160 taught that all your food mixes in your  <br>01:00:49.319 stomach and mixes like big smoothie and  <br>01:00:51.039 it doesn't matter well it does  <br>01:00:53.359 actually yeah that because that's really  <br>01:00:56.000 easy to change as well totally you don't  <br>01:00:57.799 have to change what you're eating how  <br>01:00:59.799 much you're eating just next time you're  <br>01:01:02.000 sat at a meal think oh I'm going to have  <br>01:01:04.280 the veggies on my plate first that's it  <br>01:01:07.559 so powerful these hacks are so easy  <br>01:01:10.640 Stephen I really want everybody to know  <br>01:01:12.160 them I want to become irrelevant I don't  <br>01:01:13.880 want to have any more work because  <br>01:01:15.359 everybody knows these hacks it's so  <br>01:01:17.200 important for our Public Health I think  <br>01:01:19.599 some uh vinegar has arrived for you to  <br>01:01:21.280 shot yeah no we can't shot it Stephen we  <br>01:01:23.559 have to dilute it I'm I'll dilute it as  <br>01:01:25.599 well let  <br>01:01:28.680 for yes so this is side of vinegar but  <br>01:01:32.160 any vinegar works you don't have to buy  <br>01:01:33.680 expensive vinegar it doesn't have to be  <br>01:01:35.240 organic unfiltered whatever just kitchen  <br>01:01:37.359 vinegar works no I try it straight I've  <br>01:01:40.119 actually never really drink okay but if  <br>01:01:41.599 you're dentist is upset it's not my  <br>01:01:42.839 fault okay  <br>01:01:45.920 well so Jesse told me to drink this  <br>01:01:48.839 straight no she's an expert she said  <br>01:01:51.200 she's a scientist  <br>01:01:57.599 oh  <br>01:01:59.880 gosh yeah you're not supposed to do that  <br>01:02:01.960 Stephen no I'm  <br>01:02:03.359 sorry no it's been really lovely getting  <br>01:02:05.599 to imagine if but it's not that bad but  <br>01:02:09.520 it's not something that I would do for  <br>01:02:11.079 fun yeah but also if you want to have  <br>01:02:12.760 vinegar straight you need to get higher  <br>01:02:14.160 quality vinegar there's some vinegars  <br>01:02:15.640 that taste really really good but in our  <br>01:02:17.799 case we're just trying to get the acetic  <br>01:02:19.559 acid and we don't need high quality  <br>01:02:21.039 expensive vinegar we can just do like  <br>01:02:22.400 really cheap  <br>01:02:23.359 vinegar and this is a we just put one  <br>01:02:25.480 tbspoon this is a good hack if you have  <br>01:02:27.240 a parent that has diabetes and they  <br>01:02:29.200 don't want to change anything about  <br>01:02:30.319 their lifestyle just get them to add  <br>01:02:32.160 this before their meals when they're  <br>01:02:33.160 eating carbs and you'll see a good  <br>01:02:34.319 impact on their glucos levels okay so  <br>01:02:36.119 I'm mixing it like this you didn't put  <br>01:02:37.880 much in there I put a tablespoon it's a  <br>01:02:41.839 tablespoon and even that small amount  <br>01:02:44.119 you L it looked like you you kind of  <br>01:02:45.520 filled the lid I fill the lid twice  <br>01:02:47.279 basically which is approximately one  <br>01:02:49.400 tablespoon I think cuz this is probably  <br>01:02:51.880 like yeah this is half a tablespoon I  <br>01:02:54.920 would say okay I've done this  <br>01:02:56.799 before and now you can't taste  <br>01:03:01.119 anything you're telling me that that  <br>01:03:03.039 will have an impact absolutely and the  <br>01:03:04.520 studies prove it I can't taste anything  <br>01:03:06.799 yeah maybe because I just had the big  <br>01:03:08.160 shot I think that's probably why but but  <br>01:03:11.400 totally Stephen I even meet people on  <br>01:03:13.520 the street or like my readers and stuff  <br>01:03:15.079 and they'll show me that in their purse  <br>01:03:16.440 they have a little um bottle of vinegar  <br>01:03:18.640 they take with them it's super easy and  <br>01:03:21.000 you know I was very skeptical and I  <br>01:03:22.279 think everybody was super skeptical  <br>01:03:23.680 about the vinegar thing until the  <br>01:03:25.799 studies were widely read it's it's an  <br>01:03:28.680 amazing ingredient that's been used for  <br>01:03:31.079 Millennia for its health benefits but  <br>01:03:33.279 now we understand how it works it has  <br>01:03:35.119 impact on visceral fat on cholesterol  <br>01:03:37.359 levels on glucose and on insulin levels  <br>01:03:39.319 it's a magical ingredient it's super  <br>01:03:41.039 cheap so have some vinegar but be very  <br>01:03:43.640 careful now a lot of big brands are  <br>01:03:45.559 jumping on this and are making vinegar  <br>01:03:47.039 drinks that have sugar in them so you  <br>01:03:48.960 want straight vinegar you don't want  <br>01:03:50.319 anything that has even a tiny bit of  <br>01:03:51.920 apple juice or sugar uhuhuh straight  <br>01:03:54.359 vinegar  <br>01:03:56.319 you said visceral fat yeah is that belly  <br>01:03:58.319 fat yeah it's the fat between your  <br>01:04:00.000 organs it's the fat that's really bad  <br>01:04:02.079 for you so you can have fat that is sort  <br>01:04:04.680 of on the outside of your body and you  <br>01:04:06.160 can you can grab it you know you can  <br>01:04:08.319 grab it and you can really pinch it  <br>01:04:09.920 speak for yourself no I totally have  <br>01:04:12.160 nice fat here that I can grab yeah yeah  <br>01:04:14.279 so this fat you know I can grab visceral  <br>01:04:17.160 fat is underneath my muscle layer and  <br>01:04:20.160 you would know if somebody has visceral  <br>01:04:21.799 fat if they have kind of a big hard  <br>01:04:24.200 belly have you ever seen that and they  <br>01:04:26.480 just kind of but if you touch it you  <br>01:04:28.039 can't make it into a roll that's  <br>01:04:30.039 visceral fat that's between your organs  <br>01:04:31.400 and that's really bad for you so vinegar  <br>01:04:33.000 helps of course this is not a magic  <br>01:04:35.079 solution that's going to fix all your  <br>01:04:36.960 issues and you know prevent ton of  <br>01:04:39.160 diseases it's a good Ally to have and  <br>01:04:41.720 I'm all about little allies you bring  <br>01:04:43.920 with you Gentle Giants you have  <br>01:04:45.440 throughout your day that are going to  <br>01:04:46.720 help you get to Health in an easy  <br>01:04:48.319 manageable way so so if I have that  <br>01:04:51.079 glass that you've just made for me which  <br>01:04:52.640 basically I can't taste the vinegar in  <br>01:04:54.160 because it's been dilated by water and  <br>01:04:56.400 then I eat something yeah remind me  <br>01:04:58.559 again of the impact that that will have  <br>01:04:59.760 on my glucose Spike so it'll reduce your  <br>01:05:03.079 glucose Spike by up to 30% and your  <br>01:05:05.359 insulin Spike also by up to 30% the way  <br>01:05:08.240 it works is that you have these little  <br>01:05:11.400 scissors in your stomach like miniature  <br>01:05:15.359 scissors called enzymes their job is to  <br>01:05:18.440 chop up the starches and sugars and turn  <br>01:05:20.920 them into individual glucose molecules  <br>01:05:22.920 it's a part of your digestive process  <br>01:05:24.960 these enzymes  <br>01:05:26.200 do this  <br>01:05:27.799 job vinegar will temporarily inactivate  <br>01:05:31.880 some of those little scissors  <br>01:05:33.119 essentially slowing down how quickly the  <br>01:05:36.039 glucose arrives into your bloodstream  <br>01:05:38.520 it's all about velocity we're all about  <br>01:05:41.200 trying to reduce the speed of arrival of  <br>01:05:43.920 glucose into your bloodstream that's the  <br>01:05:46.440 key so vinegar is a really effective way  <br>01:05:48.880 of doing this one of the things that I  <br>01:05:51.160 read online as well about glucose and  <br>01:05:52.839 again this is like conspiracy theories  <br>01:05:55.079 that are  <br>01:05:56.480 I read this is a variation of the Tweet  <br>01:05:59.279 um I'll read it out it says sugar in a  <br>01:06:02.520 baby's brain is called ADHD sugar in  <br>01:06:06.279 adult's brain is called dementia and  <br>01:06:07.960 Alzheimer's sugar in your eyes is called  <br>01:06:10.720 glycom sugar in your teeth is called  <br>01:06:13.000 cavities sugar on your skin is called  <br>01:06:15.240 Aging sugar in your sleep is called  <br>01:06:17.720 insomnia sugar in your blood is called  <br>01:06:20.799 diabetes sugar on Wall Street is called  <br>01:06:24.000 a billion dollar industry boom I get the  <br>01:06:27.480 point I think sugar is definitely one of  <br>01:06:30.000 the main drivers of all these things but  <br>01:06:32.520 there's other stuff going on of course  <br>01:06:33.839 but I like that I think the Alzheimer's  <br>01:06:35.440 one is really interesting to talk  <br>01:06:37.760 about there's a study that has followed  <br>01:06:40.880 people for 30 years and they found that  <br>01:06:45.240 people who had elevated glucose levels  <br>01:06:47.599 in their 40s were more likely to get  <br>01:06:50.920 Alzheimer's when they reach 60 70 80 so  <br>01:06:55.720 having high glucose levels at midlife is  <br>01:06:57.680 a risk factor for Alzheimer's when  <br>01:06:59.880 you're older not only that but  <br>01:07:01.960 scientists have started to see that some  <br>01:07:03.480 of the things you see in the brain of  <br>01:07:05.760 someone with Alzheimer's are actually  <br>01:07:07.520 similar to what you see in the body of  <br>01:07:10.240 somebody with diabetes namely  <br>01:07:13.359 inflammation glycation and insulin  <br>01:07:17.400 resistance so much so that some  <br>01:07:19.960 scientists call Alzheimer's type 3  <br>01:07:23.960 diabetes diabetes of the  <br>01:07:26.720 brain pretty freaking fascinating  <br>01:07:30.279 there's going to be so many people that  <br>01:07:31.760 are listening to our conversation when  <br>01:07:33.279 we talked about PCOS or Alzheimer's or  <br>01:07:36.200 all these kinds of things I think like  <br>01:07:38.480 how how is it fair that I've got these  <br>01:07:41.119 conditions when I don't even eat as much  <br>01:07:43.279 sugar as most people yeah you know they  <br>01:07:45.720 probably look at someone who is really  <br>01:07:47.799 binging out on sugar who doesn't have  <br>01:07:50.119 any of these things if I was a woman and  <br>01:07:51.839 I had PCOS and I ate just a little bit  <br>01:07:55.960 of sugar I'd be like this is not fair  <br>01:07:58.079 and a second ago when you said at 40 if  <br>01:07:59.640 you have elevated gluc glucose levels is  <br>01:08:03.079 that relative to like or is that to your  <br>01:08:06.920 response no they're looking at fasting  <br>01:08:09.240 glucose so a measure of a how diabetic  <br>01:08:11.839 you are essentially if you're healthy  <br>01:08:13.760 pre-diabetic or diabetic so it's not  <br>01:08:15.359 looking at the spikes it's looking at  <br>01:08:17.238 your Baseline in the morning which is  <br>01:08:18.799 what doctors measure with a blood test  <br>01:08:21.120 oh okay yeah yeah but Stephen life is  <br>01:08:23.960 unfair like I  <br>01:08:26.120 my glucose spikes led to terrible mental  <br>01:08:29.560 health episodes of depersonalization  <br>01:08:31.839 lots of people I know eat so much sugar  <br>01:08:33.759 all the time have never had one mental  <br>01:08:35.238 health issue in their life I like I  <br>01:08:37.439 don't have all the answers to that we  <br>01:08:39.120 just know that on average if you look at  <br>01:08:41.158 everybody by reducing those spikes  <br>01:08:42.960 you're going to reduce the likelihood of  <br>01:08:44.759 these diseases but you see people who  <br>01:08:46.439 like smoke two packs of cigarettes a day  <br>01:08:48.759 drink two liters of orange juice and  <br>01:08:50.399 live to 120 with no health issues and  <br>01:08:52.719 you have people who are perfectly  <br>01:08:54.120 healthy who get cancer at 25 and die  <br>01:08:56.640 like I'm not God I don't know but what I  <br>01:08:59.600 do know is that in a lot of cases when  <br>01:09:02.120 you have a condition that's linked to  <br>01:09:03.399 glucose levels and you apply these hacks  <br>01:09:05.238 you can get relief or remission that's  <br>01:09:07.198 all I know are there any societies where  <br>01:09:09.359 they just don't really eat sugar that  <br>01:09:11.640 you you can think of or any sort of I  <br>01:09:14.640 think any any culture any country that's  <br>01:09:16.880 been globalized and now has access to  <br>01:09:18.600 like fizzy drinks and stuff it's so  <br>01:09:19.960 addictive that stuff as soon as you  <br>01:09:21.479 introduce it somewhere everybody starts  <br>01:09:22.960 drinking it I'd love to do a continuous  <br>01:09:25.520 glucose monitor on like the heads a  <br>01:09:26.880 tribe or something in Africa and see  <br>01:09:28.839 amazing if they're like inflammation  <br>01:09:30.839 levels and stuff yeah I would do  <br>01:09:32.399 continous glucose monitor but also  <br>01:09:33.880 fasting glucose levels right to just  <br>01:09:35.640 kind of see what their Baseline is at do  <br>01:09:37.520 any of them have diabetes pre-diabetes  <br>01:09:39.799 or not at all what's going on but yeah I  <br>01:09:41.560 agree it's fascinating you mentioned a  <br>01:09:43.319 term earlier that I've only ever heard  <br>01:09:44.600 used when talking about a zmek glp1 yeah  <br>01:09:48.439 what what relationship does glucose have  <br>01:09:50.198 with gp1s and what the hell is a  <br>01:09:53.120 glp1 it's so interesting so  <br>01:09:55.960 in your digestive system you have these  <br>01:09:57.520 little cells they're called L cells and  <br>01:10:00.120 they're like little sensors and they  <br>01:10:01.960 just hang out there in your digestive  <br>01:10:03.520 tract just like chilling and doing  <br>01:10:05.040 nothing and then as soon as you eat and  <br>01:10:07.640 they sense food they wake up they're  <br>01:10:10.159 like alert we have a job to do and their  <br>01:10:12.960 job is to release a substance called  <br>01:10:16.920 glp1 this  <br>01:10:18.960 substance then goes to different parts  <br>01:10:21.120 of your body and tells you that you've  <br>01:10:22.840 eaten enough food and you can stop  <br>01:10:24.480 eating so for example you're having a  <br>01:10:26.440 big plate of  <br>01:10:27.640 pasta the starch goes into your  <br>01:10:30.239 digestive system the little L cells  <br>01:10:32.239 sense the pasta they're like oh we've  <br>01:10:33.800 eaten food and then it tells your brain  <br>01:10:35.880 Stephen you can stop eating you don't  <br>01:10:37.280 have to eat another five pounds of pasta  <br>01:10:39.280 you're satiated M and you become less  <br>01:10:41.560 hungry not only that but glp1 also helps  <br>01:10:45.360 your body deal with that glucose spike  <br>01:10:47.679 it says alert glucose is here let's put  <br>01:10:50.320 some of that glucose away into liver  <br>01:10:53.120 muscle and fat cells so glp1  <br>01:10:55.800 is a totally normal part of our  <br>01:10:58.679 physiology it's been there forever we  <br>01:11:00.560 all have it but recently it's been kind  <br>01:11:03.600 of  <br>01:11:05.719 um just taking advantage of so there  <br>01:11:08.199 were scientists and Pharma companies who  <br>01:11:09.920 said hey this gp1 thing is pretty cool  <br>01:11:13.480 what happens if we give somebody 10  <br>01:11:16.880 times 20 times a 100 times more glp1  <br>01:11:19.199 than they naturally have what what's  <br>01:11:21.159 going to happen Let's test that so they  <br>01:11:23.400 did that and what happened was people's  <br>01:11:25.600 glucose levels started decreasing a lot  <br>01:11:27.800 because remember gp1 puts glucose away  <br>01:11:31.239 second impact people stopped  <br>01:11:35.360 eathing they were not hungry anymore  <br>01:11:38.159 they appetite Zapped gel1 is a very  <br>01:11:41.600 powerful appetite suppressant especially  <br>01:11:43.440 wh|## SUMMARY  <br>Jesse Enpay discusses glucose management, health impacts of sugar, and practical hacks for better health.  <br>  <br>## IDEAS:  <br>- Glucose spikes can impact mental health, acne, and aging significantly.  <br>- Most fruits in supermarkets are not natural; they are bred for sweetness.  <br>- Eating sugar can lead to chronic fatigue and mitochondrial dysfunction.  <br>- Insulin resistance is linked to infertility and hormonal imbalances in women.  <br>- Vinegar can reduce glucose spikes by up to 30% when consumed before meals.  <br>- Savory breakfasts can prevent glucose spikes and maintain energy levels throughout the day.  <br>- Consuming whole fruits is better than juices for managing glucose levels.  <br>- Eating foods in a specific order can significantly lower glucose spikes.  <br>- Adding fiber-rich veggies to meals can slow glucose absorption.  <br>- Regular exercise after meals helps to lower glucose levels effectively.  <br>- Many people are unaware of how sugar impacts their health negatively.  <br>- Elevated glucose levels in midlife increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  <br>- Foods like honey and grapes can cause significant glucose spikes despite being perceived as healthy.  <br>- Continuous glucose monitors help individuals understand their dietary impacts on glucose levels.  <br>- Insulin is responsible for storing glucose in fat cells, leading to weight gain.  <br>- The relationship between glucose and mood affects daily productivity and overall happiness.  <br>- Many cultures traditionally start meals with vegetables to improve glucose management.  <br>- High glucose diets can lead to increased inflammation and health issues.  <br>- Glucose spikes can cause cravings, making it difficult to maintain a balanced diet.  <br>- Lack of sleep can worsen insulin resistance and glucose management.  <br>- Health education around glucose management can empower individuals to reclaim their health.  <br>  <br>## INSIGHTS:  <br>- Understanding glucose management can empower individuals to improve their overall health and well-being.  <br>- Dietary choices impact glucose levels, affecting physical health, mental clarity, and emotional balance.  <br>- Reducing sugar intake can lead to significant improvements in energy and mood stability.  <br>- A balanced diet incorporating proteins and healthy fats helps mitigate glucose spikes effectively.  <br>- People are often unaware of the hidden sugars in seemingly healthy foods like fruit smoothies.  <br>- Knowledge about glucose can transform health outcomes, especially for those with insulin resistance.  <br>- The importance of educating the public on glucose impacts spans beyond personal health to societal health.  <br>- Implementing small dietary hacks can lead to substantial health improvements over time.  <br>- Sustainable health practices require a combination of dietary management, exercise, and education.  <br>- The body’s response to sugar reveals deeper connections between diet, mood, and cognitive function.  <br>  <br>## QUOTES:  <br>- “80% of the population have glucose spikes every single day and that’s when problems start happening.”  <br>- “The beauty of the technology of a smart home is its scalability: you can start small.”  <br>- “Glucose spikes have a few different consequences; having a few spikes here and there is not a big deal.”  <br>- “There’s no such thing as good sugar; all sugar is the same.”  <br>- “Eating a meal in the right order reduces the glucose spike by up to 75%.”  <br>- “The more glucose spikes you have, the harder it will be for your body to manage your spikes.”  <br>- “Insulin is responsible for storing glucose in fat cells, leading to weight gain.”  <br>- “Fasting is a stressor on the body; it is a good stressor but still a stressor.”  <br>- “Savory breakfasts can prevent glucose spikes and maintain energy levels throughout the day.”  <br>- “The relationship between glucose and mood affects daily productivity and overall happiness.”  <br>- “The food landscape is toxic, and most of us just eat sugar and starches.”  <br>- “Vinegar contains acetic acid which interacts with your digestive enzymes and cuts the glucose spike.”  <br>- “The more insulin resistant you are, the more likely you are to be infertile.”  <br>- “Glucose spikes can cause cravings, making it difficult to maintain a balanced diet.”  <br>- “People often believe that if the sugar is coming from a fruit, it’s good sugar.”  <br>- “High glucose diets can lead to increased inflammation and health issues.”  <br>- “You can’t just give somebody a scientific paper; you have to explain it in a visual way.”  <br>- “Eating sugar can lead to chronic fatigue and mitochondrial dysfunction.”  <br>- “Continuous glucose monitors help individuals understand their dietary impacts on glucose levels.”  <br>- “Insulin resistance is linked to infertility and hormonal imbalances in women.”  <br>  <br>## HABITS:  <br>- Start each day with a savory breakfast to stabilize glucose levels.  <br>- Consume vinegar diluted in water before meals to reduce glucose spikes.  <br>- Incorporate fiber-rich vegetables at the beginning of meals to slow glucose absorption.  <br>- Engage in light physical activity after meals to help manage glucose levels.  <br>- Monitor glucose levels regularly using continuous glucose monitors for better health insights.  <br>- Avoid sugary snacks and replace them with healthy savory alternatives.  <br>- Prioritize sleep and manage stress to maintain healthy insulin levels.  <br>- Educate yourself on food choices and their impact on glucose levels.  <br>- Experiment with the order of food consumption to manage glucose spikes effectively.  <br>- Avoid fruit juices and opt for whole fruits to benefit from fiber content.  <br>  <br>## FACTS:  <br>- One billion people globally have

What Alcohol Is Doing To Your Brain!  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/R6xbXOp7wDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch/R6xbXOp7wDA)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.240 there's a very famous experiment in  <br>00:00:02.200 which rats were engineered to have no  <br>00:00:04.200 dopamine and the scientists discovered  <br>00:00:06.160 that if they put food in the rat's mouth  <br>00:00:07.919 the rat would eat but if you put the  <br>00:00:09.280 food even a body length away the rat  <br>00:00:11.000 will starve to death which tells us that  <br>00:00:13.519 dopamine is fundamental to get the  <br>00:00:15.719 things that we need for our basic  <br>00:00:17.439 survival now every time we're doing  <br>00:00:19.640 something that's pleasurable from sugar  <br>00:00:21.439 to video games work pornography social  <br>00:00:23.599 media that will affect dopamine and the  <br>00:00:25.680 more dopamine that's released the more  <br>00:00:27.240 likely that drug or behavior is to be  <br>00:00:29.480 addictive but also the genetic risk of  <br>00:00:31.599 addiction is about 50 to 60% so if you  <br>00:00:34.200 have a biological parent or grandparent  <br>00:00:36.280 with addiction you are more likely to  <br>00:00:38.440 develop that addiction we have to keep  <br>00:00:40.399 it in balance in order to stay healthy  <br>00:00:42.600 Dr Anna lmy is Professor of Psychiatry  <br>00:00:44.600 at Stanford chief of the Stanford  <br>00:00:46.039 addiction clinic and a world leading  <br>00:00:47.719 expert on the subject of doping she will  <br>00:00:49.559 tell you how this one powerful chemical  <br>00:00:51.120 is controlling your life and what to do  <br>00:00:52.879 about it one of the most important  <br>00:00:54.399 findings in Neuroscience in the past 75  <br>00:00:56.840 years is that the same parts of the  <br>00:00:58.399 brain that process pleasure also process  <br>00:01:00.559 pain and the balance wants to remain  <br>00:01:02.920 level the problem is that we  <br>00:01:04.438 automatically seek out pleasure and  <br>00:01:06.000 avoid pain and we're exposed to all  <br>00:01:07.759 kinds of Pleasures that we have in the  <br>00:01:09.240 modern world and our brains are reeling  <br>00:01:11.119 in response to try to compensate now I  <br>00:01:13.000 need more of my drug and more potent  <br>00:01:14.479 forms to get the same effect which then  <br>00:01:16.320 leads to addiction and that's what  <br>00:01:17.720 happened to me when I got addicted to  <br>00:01:19.200 romance novels take me into that phase  <br>00:01:21.720 of your life I was out of control and I  <br>00:01:23.960 needed to restore a level balance and  <br>00:01:25.720 take the advice I give my patients and  <br>00:01:27.520 what is that

<br>00:02:14.200 minutes trying to figure out how to say  <br>00:02:15.720 this to you so I'm just going to say it  <br>00:02:17.000 how it comes out my mouth and I  <br>00:02:18.120 apologize if this is messy but if there  <br>00:02:20.280 was ever an episode this year that you  <br>00:02:22.440 should listen to it is this one I've  <br>00:02:24.840 since this episode was recorded about a  <br>00:02:26.360 month ago all I've been thinking about  <br>00:02:28.560 is how on Earth I get you to watch this  <br>00:02:30.640 and I don't say this often the last time  <br>00:02:32.160 I said this was the first time Mo gordak  <br>00:02:34.239 came on this podcast this is the second  <br>00:02:36.160 time I've said this in almost four years  <br>00:02:38.200 of recording this podcast on YouTube and  <br>00:02:40.200 the reason for that is so many of the  <br>00:02:42.560 things that I know you're struggling  <br>00:02:43.680 with in your life that stand in the way  <br>00:02:45.319 of the person you want to become that  <br>00:02:47.000 relationship you have with your phone  <br>00:02:49.319 the  <br>00:02:50.400 procrastination the cycles of behavior  <br>00:02:53.120 that make you feel embarrassed and full  <br>00:02:54.800 of shame that you've just never been  <br>00:02:56.040 able to crack all of them all of them I  <br>00:02:59.840 genuinely believe for many of you are  <br>00:03:01.159 going to be understood today if you  <br>00:03:03.120 listen to this episode it has changed my  <br>00:03:05.440 life and it has changed much of the  <br>00:03:07.360 lives of my team if if I'm wrong here  <br>00:03:11.080 you have the right to message me and  <br>00:03:12.840 tell me that I was wrong please listen  <br>00:03:15.280 to this episode really really I mean  <br>00:03:17.120 that from the bottom of my heart and  <br>00:03:18.560 just to make sure you do throughout this  <br>00:03:20.120 episode there's going to be these popups  <br>00:03:21.720 if you collect eight of these codes that  <br>00:03:23.560 are going to pop up on the screen and  <br>00:03:25.080 put them in the document link below  <br>00:03:26.959 you'll unlock something very special  <br>00:03:28.560 some additional content please listen to  <br>00:03:30.720 this  <br>00:03:34.959 episode Dr Anna  <br>00:03:37.439 lmy you wrote one of the most iconic  <br>00:03:39.959 well-known books about dopamine which  <br>00:03:43.040 propelled the subject matter of dopamine  <br>00:03:44.840 into the public  <br>00:03:45.959 Consciousness but I guess the most  <br>00:03:47.920 important question I should ask you  <br>00:03:50.360 is why does dopamine matter ah good  <br>00:03:54.680 question good good place to start I mean  <br>00:03:57.760 dopamine matters because it  <br>00:04:00.319 fundamental to our survival right so  <br>00:04:03.159 it's the chemical that we make in our  <br>00:04:04.760 brain that tells us this is something we  <br>00:04:07.400 should approach explore investigate so  <br>00:04:10.879 it's it's really almost the survival  <br>00:04:13.120 chemical so what is dopamine if you had  <br>00:04:15.360 to explain it to a 10-year-old how would  <br>00:04:17.160 you go about explaining it so dopamine  <br>00:04:19.478 is a chemical that we make in our brain  <br>00:04:23.240 um it has many different functions but  <br>00:04:27.080 one of its most important functions is  <br>00:04:29.479 that it helps us experience pleasure  <br>00:04:32.919 reward and  <br>00:04:34.800 motivation um it may be even more  <br>00:04:37.000 important for the motivation to do  <br>00:04:39.400 things than it is for the pleasure  <br>00:04:41.199 itself so for example there's a very  <br>00:04:43.840 famous experiment in which rats were  <br>00:04:46.199 engineered to have no dopamine in the  <br>00:04:49.160 brain's reward pathway and the  <br>00:04:51.360 scientists discovered that if they put  <br>00:04:53.479 food in the rat's mouth the rat would  <br>00:04:55.280 eat the food would seem to get some  <br>00:04:57.360 pleasure from the food if you can deter  <br>00:04:59.919 that from watching a rat eat which I  <br>00:05:01.919 think they felt like they could uh but  <br>00:05:04.039 if you put the food even a body length  <br>00:05:06.280 away the rat will starve to death the  <br>00:05:09.560 idea being that without dopamine we're  <br>00:05:12.479 not motivated to seek out the things  <br>00:05:15.400 that we need for our basic survival  <br>00:05:18.080 that's crazy so you get a rat you put  <br>00:05:20.440 the food an inch from its mouth and it  <br>00:05:24.039 will starve to death because it doesn't  <br>00:05:25.520 have dopamine the dopamine required to  <br>00:05:27.280 just reach out and eat yeah essentially  <br>00:05:29.800 maybe it's not an inch maybe it's a  <br>00:05:31.120 little more than an inch but the idea  <br>00:05:33.160 being that dopamine is necessary to be  <br>00:05:36.680 motivated to do the work to get the  <br>00:05:39.880 thing that we need and having an  <br>00:05:43.400 understanding of dopamine how might that  <br>00:05:45.840 improve my life having a basic  <br>00:05:48.479 understanding of how dopamine Works how  <br>00:05:51.360 we process Pleasure and Pain and also  <br>00:05:54.639 what happens with dopamine as we go from  <br>00:05:57.240 adaptive recreational use to Mal  <br>00:05:59.639 adaptive addictive use is something that  <br>00:06:02.560 is really useful especially for those of  <br>00:06:04.720 us living in the modern world where now  <br>00:06:07.240 we're exposed to so many reinforcing  <br>00:06:09.599 substances and behaviors that we've all  <br>00:06:12.000 become vulnerable to the problem of  <br>00:06:13.800 addiction and what are the biggest  <br>00:06:15.680 misconceptions of on the subject of  <br>00:06:17.479 dopamine because it's kind of thrown  <br>00:06:19.039 around in society I see it in my group  <br>00:06:20.840 chats people saying I need more dopamine  <br>00:06:22.840 or whatever or you know that person just  <br>00:06:24.960 craves dopamine what what are the  <br>00:06:26.720 biggest misconceptions you've come  <br>00:06:28.000 across the main miscon conception is  <br>00:06:30.199 that somehow we can get addicted to  <br>00:06:32.319 dopamine we're not getting addicted to  <br>00:06:34.680 dopamine itself dopamine is neither good  <br>00:06:37.240 nor bad it's a signal to tell us whether  <br>00:06:41.479 or not something that we're doing is  <br>00:06:44.120 potentially useful for our survival and  <br>00:06:47.120 also it's related to what we predicted  <br>00:06:51.360 about how rewarding or pleasurable  <br>00:06:53.759 something would be and so it's really um  <br>00:06:56.800 you know I sort of sometimes I joke it's  <br>00:06:58.360 like the um reward theory of relativity  <br>00:07:02.319 DOP mean is in the sense that Pleasure  <br>00:07:04.560 and Pain really are truly relative to  <br>00:07:07.199 one another and so dopamine gives us  <br>00:07:09.680 information about where we are in that  <br>00:07:12.280 relativity scale between Pleasure and  <br>00:07:14.360 Pain and when you say relative you mean  <br>00:07:16.440 I mean it's it's quite fitting for  <br>00:07:18.000 anyone that can't see we have a a set of  <br>00:07:19.960 scales on the table and scales are  <br>00:07:22.319 relative to each other because if you  <br>00:07:23.560 pour in one end the other end goes up  <br>00:07:26.000 and if you pour in the other end the  <br>00:07:27.000 other end goes up and this end goes down  <br>00:07:29.240 and when you say relative that's what  <br>00:07:30.800 you're describing right yes that's what  <br>00:07:32.680 that's what I'm describing yes okay and  <br>00:07:35.360 what activities that I do every day have  <br>00:07:38.160 an impact on my  <br>00:07:39.639 dopamine well probably almost everything  <br>00:07:43.479 you know in some ways um I mean every  <br>00:07:45.919 time we are doing something that's  <br>00:07:48.599 pleasurable reinforcing rewarding that  <br>00:07:52.000 will affect dope mean it's it's really  <br>00:07:54.240 the primary signal that lets us know  <br>00:07:57.080 that this thing is potentially important  <br>00:07:59.560 for our survival as I mentioned um but  <br>00:08:02.440 you know even um aversive stimuli can  <br>00:08:06.680 trigger dopamine what's oh something  <br>00:08:09.319 that's painful or not pleasurable  <br>00:08:11.159 dopamine gets involved in in that um  <br>00:08:14.159 equation anything that's novel or new is  <br>00:08:17.960 something that triggers our dopamine in  <br>00:08:20.560 in our reward pathway dopamine is  <br>00:08:23.039 fundamental for movement so not just  <br>00:08:26.120 pleasure and reward but also movement so  <br>00:08:28.800 for example Parkinson's disease which is  <br>00:08:31.560 a disease related to stiffness and  <br>00:08:34.320 Tremor is caused by a depletion of  <br>00:08:37.719 dopamine in a part of the brain called  <br>00:08:39.640 the substantia [ __ ] and as dopamine  <br>00:08:42.479 gets depleted in that part of the brain  <br>00:08:44.680 people lose the ability to move their  <br>00:08:47.240 bodies and it's probably no coincidence  <br>00:08:50.360 that the same neurotransmitter that is  <br>00:08:52.120 so important for pleasure reward  <br>00:08:54.200 motivation is also really important for  <br>00:08:56.680 movement because most organisms have to  <br>00:08:59.440 to locomote toward the object of their  <br>00:09:02.200 desire we want that thing we have to  <br>00:09:04.680 exert effort right we have to put in the  <br>00:09:06.959 work to go get it but in the world today  <br>00:09:09.680 we really don't have to do that right we  <br>00:09:11.880 can swipe right we can swipe left and  <br>00:09:13.959 all of a sudden it magically appears at  <br>00:09:16.079 the touch of a finger and that's very  <br>00:09:18.720 confusing for our brains because that's  <br>00:09:20.680 not how we evolved we really evolved for  <br>00:09:23.399 for having to do quite a bit of upfront  <br>00:09:26.240 work for a tiny little bit of reward  <br>00:09:29.920 I just want to before we move on talk  <br>00:09:32.079 about this point you said because I  <br>00:09:33.320 think it's quite foundational to  <br>00:09:34.600 everything we're going to talk about  <br>00:09:35.680 about dopamine being relative to pain  <br>00:09:38.200 and I have this set of scales in front  <br>00:09:39.839 of me and here I have some chemicals  <br>00:09:43.480 that are likely to produce dopamine in  <br>00:09:46.120 my brain I believe right so alcohol I  <br>00:09:49.040 have some rum I have some whiskey I have  <br>00:09:51.120 some vodka and can you explain to me  <br>00:09:53.839 using this rum whiskey and vodka how  <br>00:09:56.760 dopamine is relative to pain and what  <br>00:09:59.519 going on in my brain sure okay I'll  <br>00:10:01.360 slide this over to you oh  <br>00:10:03.320 okay so one of the most exciting  <br>00:10:06.839 findings in Neuroscience in the past 75  <br>00:10:09.560 years is that Pleasure and Pain are  <br>00:10:12.160 collocated in the brain so the same  <br>00:10:14.880 parts of the brain that process pleasure  <br>00:10:17.000 also process pain and in a very simple  <br>00:10:20.600 reductionist kind of way they work like  <br>00:10:23.160 opposite sides of a balance so imagine  <br>00:10:26.720 that deep in your brain's reward pathway  <br>00:10:29.040 which is is another exciting Discovery  <br>00:10:31.440 right that there's this dedicated reward  <br>00:10:33.120 pathway of the brain that consists  <br>00:10:35.279 broadly speaking of the prefrontal CeX  <br>00:10:37.680 which is this large gray matter area  <br>00:10:39.720 right behind our foreheads that's so  <br>00:10:41.399 important for future planning for  <br>00:10:43.680 delayed gratification for appreciating  <br>00:10:45.920 future consequences you might think of  <br>00:10:48.160 it as like the brakes on the car if  <br>00:10:50.200 we're going to analogize to to a to an  <br>00:10:52.839 engine and then deep you know in the  <br>00:10:55.880 brain we've got what we call the limic  <br>00:10:58.240 areas or the emotion brain and there you  <br>00:11:01.079 have the nucleus accumbens and the  <br>00:11:02.880 vental tegmental area that are rich in  <br>00:11:06.240 dopamine releasing neurons right and  <br>00:11:09.200 they act like the accelerator on the car  <br>00:11:11.639 so when you've got a healthy functioning  <br>00:11:13.760 brain you've got enough accelerator but  <br>00:11:17.240 not too much right so enough dop Meine  <br>00:11:19.200 being released but not too much and  <br>00:11:20.680 youve got a healthy prefrontal cortex  <br>00:11:23.079 putting the brakes on that dopamine  <br>00:11:25.560 release when people um become addicted  <br>00:11:29.680 there's either a problem with the brakes  <br>00:11:32.600 the prefrontal cortex or the accelerator  <br>00:11:35.120 the nucleus accumbens and vental  <br>00:11:36.600 tegmental area or both right what we're  <br>00:11:39.800 finding is that there's actually a  <br>00:11:42.720 disconnect so there are large neuronal  <br>00:11:45.160 circuits and Pathways between those deep  <br>00:11:47.440 lyic structures and the prefrontal  <br>00:11:48.920 cortex that literally get severed or  <br>00:11:51.320 disconnected when people become addicted  <br>00:11:54.560 as we think about Pleasure and Pain  <br>00:11:57.240 being collocated in the same parts of  <br>00:11:58.880 the brain working like opposite sides of  <br>00:12:00.920 the  <br>00:12:01.920 balance in order to understand what  <br>00:12:04.360 happens in the addicted brain is to  <br>00:12:06.279 appreciate that there are fundamental  <br>00:12:08.480 rules governing this balance and one of  <br>00:12:11.360 the most important rules is is that the  <br>00:12:13.279 balance wants to remain level it does  <br>00:12:15.959 not want to be tilted very long to the  <br>00:12:17.760 side of either pleasure or pain and in  <br>00:12:20.920 fact what our brain does is first tilt  <br>00:12:22.839 an equal and opposite amount to whatever  <br>00:12:25.519 the initial stimulus is so I'm going to  <br>00:12:27.519 try to illustrate that here so let's say  <br>00:12:28.959 our  <br>00:12:29.680 initial stimulus is alcohol now alcohol  <br>00:12:32.800 Works through its own chemical pathway  <br>00:12:35.079 it works on our endogenous opioid system  <br>00:12:37.440 the opioids that we make we have  <br>00:12:39.000 receptors for opioids in our brains it  <br>00:12:41.199 works on our endogenous Gaba system  <br>00:12:43.240 which is our calming  <br>00:12:44.920 neurotransmitter and at the end of the  <br>00:12:46.839 day it releases dopamine in the reward  <br>00:12:49.519 pathway so any potentially addictive  <br>00:12:52.199 substance will release dopamine in the  <br>00:12:54.399 reward pathway the more that's released  <br>00:12:57.360 and the faster that's released in a  <br>00:12:59.600 given individual the more likely that  <br>00:13:01.959 substance is to be  <br>00:13:03.519 addictive now another important concept  <br>00:13:06.240 here is what we call drug of choice  <br>00:13:08.000 which is to say what releases a lot of  <br>00:13:10.399 dopamine in your brain may not release a  <br>00:13:13.079 lot of dopamine in my brain and vice  <br>00:13:14.760 versa right which is this idea that  <br>00:13:16.800 people have predictions to different  <br>00:13:18.639 kinds of drugs and by the way people can  <br>00:13:20.600 get addicted to behaviors too I should  <br>00:13:22.680 emphasize that when you say drug of  <br>00:13:25.440 choice you mean the brain has a  <br>00:13:28.040 particular sensitivity to that drug in  <br>00:13:31.120 terms of dopamine yes okay the more  <br>00:13:34.279 dopamine that's released the faster that  <br>00:13:36.079 it's released the more likely that drug  <br>00:13:38.000 is to be addictive for a given  <br>00:13:39.639 individual so you're holding some  <br>00:13:41.079 whiskey there I'm holding some whiskey  <br>00:13:42.839 there could be a brain that is very  <br>00:13:44.600 sensitive to Whiskey and there could be  <br>00:13:46.760 a different brain that you could pull  <br>00:13:48.320 all the whiskey and you like and the  <br>00:13:49.720 dopamine response is sort of limited  <br>00:13:52.759 exactly okay and for many of my patients  <br>00:13:56.519 who become addicted to alcohol they will  <br>00:13:58.759 tell you that from the first moment they  <br>00:14:01.040 had alcohol they knew they were either  <br>00:14:03.480 in trouble or had met their best friend  <br>00:14:05.720 or some combination it was a very potent  <br>00:14:09.040 experience for them all right so let's  <br>00:14:11.680 let's go ahead and put this on the  <br>00:14:13.160 pleasure side of the  <br>00:14:14.680 balance dopamine is being released but  <br>00:14:16.920 no sooner has that happened then my  <br>00:14:19.000 brain will work very hard to restore a  <br>00:14:22.160 level balance and by the way a level  <br>00:14:24.160 balance is what neuroscientists call  <br>00:14:26.720 homeostasis okay and one of the  <br>00:14:29.120 overarching physiologic drives for all  <br>00:14:31.160 living organisms is to return to  <br>00:14:32.959 homeostasis homeostasis is that  <br>00:14:35.360 parameter of what's often called called  <br>00:14:38.440 affordances or states of being that are  <br>00:14:41.600 adaptive and healthy for the organism  <br>00:14:43.839 for example like we have a certain  <br>00:14:45.920 homeostasis of body temperature and if  <br>00:14:47.920 we go much too much beyond that either  <br>00:14:50.959 too high or too low we will disintegrate  <br>00:14:53.120 and die right so homeostasis is that  <br>00:14:55.639 that states of being that are compatible  <br>00:14:58.480 with existence  <br>00:14:59.720 and and potentially advantageous too  <br>00:15:01.560 sort of Baseline level that's right yeah  <br>00:15:04.079 Baseline level and by the way we're  <br>00:15:05.360 always releasing dopamine at a kind of  <br>00:15:07.040 tonic Baseline level in our brains I  <br>00:15:08.880 sometimes think of it as the heartbeat  <br>00:15:10.040 of the brain so what's happened here for  <br>00:15:11.920 people that can't see is you've poured a  <br>00:15:13.199 little bit of whiskey into one end of  <br>00:15:14.519 the scale the pleasure side of the scale  <br>00:15:17.040 and the other side of the scale has  <br>00:15:18.680 risen because now there's whiskey um in  <br>00:15:21.120 the the pleasure side which I guess is  <br>00:15:22.720 released dopamine exactly so now now we'  <br>00:15:25.519 released dopamine in the reward pathway  <br>00:15:27.880 okay because the pain side went up does  <br>00:15:29.920 that mean there's now less pain in the  <br>00:15:31.480 brain well I think you know again this  <br>00:15:34.040 is a metaphor it's an oversimplification  <br>00:15:36.560 the idea here is just when we press on  <br>00:15:38.920 the pleasure side we're releasing  <br>00:15:40.839 dopamine in the reward pathway and  <br>00:15:42.279 experiencing pleasure okay okay but no  <br>00:15:45.240 sooner has that happened then our brain  <br>00:15:47.199 will try to compensate or adapt to  <br>00:15:50.600 increased dopamine firing by down  <br>00:15:52.959 regulating dopamine transmission for  <br>00:15:54.880 example by involuting post synaptic  <br>00:15:57.560 dopamine receptors that mean okay okay  <br>00:16:00.759 so our brain is a bunch of wires you  <br>00:16:04.240 know um that conduct these electrical  <br>00:16:06.639 signals and and these long spindly cells  <br>00:16:09.120 are called neurons and the thing about  <br>00:16:11.199 neurons is that they don't actually  <br>00:16:13.120 touch end to end there's a little Gap or  <br>00:16:15.519 space between them and that Gap is  <br>00:16:17.000 called the synapse and that Gap or  <br>00:16:20.199 synapse is bridged by what we call  <br>00:16:21.880 neurotransmitters and dopamine is one of  <br>00:16:23.800 those neurotransmitters okay and when  <br>00:16:27.120 the pre synaptic neuron pulses and  <br>00:16:29.759 releases dopamine it crosses the synapse  <br>00:16:32.759 and binds to a receptor on the post  <br>00:16:35.360 synaptic neuron which either continues  <br>00:16:38.000 or aborts that electrical signal does  <br>00:16:40.160 that make sense yes okay so one of the  <br>00:16:42.920 ways that our brain can decrease the  <br>00:16:46.040 effects of dopamine decrease dopamine  <br>00:16:48.160 transmission is by involuting or taking  <br>00:16:51.480 inside the neuron the post synaptic  <br>00:16:54.399 receptor that way when dopamine is  <br>00:16:56.360 released it has nowhere to bind oh okay  <br>00:16:58.480 so it's like removing the docking  <br>00:17:00.079 station exactly very good it's removing  <br>00:17:02.800 the docking station so essentially  <br>00:17:04.480 getting back to our scale we've we've  <br>00:17:06.480 you know ingested alcohol we've  <br>00:17:08.199 increased dopamine firing in the reward  <br>00:17:10.280 pathway but remember our pleasure pain  <br>00:17:12.319 balance wants to return to the level  <br>00:17:14.400 position level with the ground  <br>00:17:16.679 homeostasis so it's going to decrease  <br>00:17:19.160 dopamine transmission by for example  <br>00:17:21.520 involuting those post synaptic dopamine  <br>00:17:24.319 receptors but one thing about the brain  <br>00:17:27.079 in its process of trying to get back to  <br>00:17:29.799 homeostasis and again I like to think of  <br>00:17:31.760 this neuro adaptation process as these  <br>00:17:33.760 Gremlins hopping on the pain side of the  <br>00:17:36.400 balance to bring it level again you  <br>00:17:38.039 don't have Gremlins here you have these  <br>00:17:39.360 little rocks but let's go ahead and put  <br>00:17:41.480 a rock on the pain side of the balance  <br>00:17:43.240 and the these rocks are are friends  <br>00:17:45.880 right their job is to level the balance  <br>00:17:47.880 because remember we got to go back to  <br>00:17:48.799 homeostasis I'm going to put a rock on  <br>00:17:50.600 and you're going to see oh my gosh it  <br>00:17:53.000 overshot right it now I've got it  <br>00:17:55.880 pressed down on the the pain side of the  <br>00:17:57.840 balance but that's exactly what happens  <br>00:18:00.480 in our brains in this process of neuro  <br>00:18:02.559 adaptation those Gremlins hopping on the  <br>00:18:04.960 pain side of the balance don't get off  <br>00:18:07.120 as soon as the balance is level they  <br>00:18:08.720 stay on until we're tilted and equal an  <br>00:18:11.360 opposite amount so is that what a  <br>00:18:13.080 hangover is or a cown as they would say  <br>00:18:16.360 when people take drugs they say I have a  <br>00:18:18.120 come down exactly that's exactly what it  <br>00:18:21.520 is that's the hangover the come down the  <br>00:18:23.760 Blue Monday or on a much smaller scale  <br>00:18:26.799 just that moment of craving right that  <br>00:18:29.080 moment of wanting to have one more shot  <br>00:18:31.960 right why does it overshoot why can't it  <br>00:18:33.720 just perfectly hit homeostasis such a  <br>00:18:36.360 great question because then we'd feel  <br>00:18:38.159 fine yeah why did Mother Nature do that  <br>00:18:40.400 to us so cruel right yeah okay I'm going  <br>00:18:45.640 to tell you an evolutionary just so  <br>00:18:47.480 story what we mean by that is we don't  <br>00:18:49.320 really know why you know this mechanism  <br>00:18:51.880 exists but from an evolutionary  <br>00:18:54.520 perspective if you're living in a world  <br>00:18:56.720 of scarcity and everpresent danger this  <br>00:19:00.039 is the perfect mechanism to make sure  <br>00:19:03.200 that we're never satisfied with what we  <br>00:19:05.520 have that we're always wanting more it's  <br>00:19:08.640 made us the ultimate  <br>00:19:10.480 Seekers okay because immediately after  <br>00:19:12.880 getting something I'm now feeling a lack  <br>00:19:15.720 of pleasure and I'm at a deficit you  <br>00:19:17.960 know on the pain side of the scale which  <br>00:19:19.760 means that I'm going to go seeking out  <br>00:19:21.400 more dopamine and in a world where  <br>00:19:23.960 everything is quite scarce that could  <br>00:19:25.799 mean going on another 4-Hour hunt the  <br>00:19:27.960 next day to go killer gazelle or  <br>00:19:29.480 something perfect you got yeah you got  <br>00:19:31.960 it interesting yeah okay so that's going  <br>00:19:34.960 to motivate me because this get so Jesus  <br>00:19:39.000 people that have hangovers don't seem  <br>00:19:40.320 very  <br>00:19:41.440 motivated right so now that's a so why  <br>00:19:44.240 is that right it's because alcohol is a  <br>00:19:49.600 product of human  <br>00:19:51.960 engineering that releases so much  <br>00:19:54.640 dopamine all at once in the reward  <br>00:19:56.880 pathway that our brains are reeling to  <br>00:20:00.240 compensate right we we really weren't  <br>00:20:03.080 evolved for this much pleasure with this  <br>00:20:06.720 much easy access as you said yourself we  <br>00:20:09.240 were really evolved for to have to do  <br>00:20:12.200 quite a lot of work upfront and to be  <br>00:20:15.039 hungry and to be lonely and to be tired  <br>00:20:17.600 and then get a little bit of reward that  <br>00:20:20.039 would then bring us back up to  <br>00:20:22.440 homostasis so really we were evolved to  <br>00:20:25.159 be pressing on the pain side of the  <br>00:20:26.760 balance in our effort to find pleasure  <br>00:20:29.440 and then when we find it that little bit  <br>00:20:31.720 of food or clothing or shelter or a mate  <br>00:20:34.320 would bring us back to the level  <br>00:20:35.840 position does that makes sense yeah so  <br>00:20:37.520 you're you're telling me essentially  <br>00:20:38.679 that we're all wired to be addicted  <br>00:20:42.679 because if this is how our brain works  <br>00:20:44.400 in a world it's designed to seek out  <br>00:20:48.039 more dopamine but the problem we have  <br>00:20:50.000 now is we have all the synthetic  <br>00:20:51.600 dopamine effectively like this so  <br>00:20:53.840 synthetic chemicals and synthetic things  <br>00:20:55.880 and you know an Internet that is wiring  <br>00:20:58.679 us to give us so much dopamine so easily  <br>00:21:01.640 that that means that our brains are  <br>00:21:02.760 effectively like mismatched to the world  <br>00:21:05.320 that we live in and therefore wired to  <br>00:21:06.760 be addicted yeah I think you actually  <br>00:21:08.039 said that I found a quote you said in an  <br>00:21:10.440 interview where you said we all wired to  <br>00:21:12.880 be addicted and if you're not addicted  <br>00:21:14.440 yet it's right around the corner right  <br>00:21:17.120 coming to a website near you yes I I  <br>00:21:19.760 guess I would I would qualify that a  <br>00:21:21.840 little bit by saying we're wired for  <br>00:21:24.480 survival in a world of scarcity that's  <br>00:21:27.919 not the world live in now we live in a  <br>00:21:29.679 world of overwhelming overabundance and  <br>00:21:32.320 so there is a mismatch between this  <br>00:21:34.480 ancient wiring that has us relentlessly  <br>00:21:36.679 pursuing pleasure in order to survive  <br>00:21:40.279 and a world that's so infused with  <br>00:21:42.600 pleasure and so many rewarding stimuli  <br>00:21:44.960 that now we're overwhelming our reward  <br>00:21:47.120 system and our brains are reeling in  <br>00:21:49.360 response to try to compensate so what  <br>00:21:51.679 happens to this scale then in such a  <br>00:21:53.559 world where I can get a big hit of  <br>00:21:55.320 dopamine all the time using some of  <br>00:21:57.600 these synthetic things or the internet  <br>00:21:59.279 or pornography or whatever else what's  <br>00:22:01.120 going on with this scale over and over  <br>00:22:02.679 again okay great so let me get there let  <br>00:22:04.960 me first say though that remember after  <br>00:22:07.559 we do something that's highly  <br>00:22:09.279 pleasurable our brain compensates with  <br>00:22:11.480 neuro adaptation tilting an equal and  <br>00:22:13.720 opposite amount to the side of pain and  <br>00:22:16.480 then restoring our balance back to the  <br>00:22:19.440 level position right or what we call  <br>00:22:21.400 homeostasis so this doesn't last forever  <br>00:22:23.919 right it's to pleasure then it's to pain  <br>00:22:26.240 then it's back to the level position but  <br>00:22:28.720 if we continue to consume our drug of  <br>00:22:31.240 choice over days to weeks to months to  <br>00:22:34.120 years and we add in a whole bunch of  <br>00:22:36.760 other drugs and now we're consuming you  <br>00:22:40.039 know pornography and smoking pot and  <br>00:22:43.120 eating um donuts and you know you name  <br>00:22:47.520 it all at the same time then essentially  <br>00:22:50.559 what happens is those Gremlins on the  <br>00:22:53.559 pain side of the balance end up camped  <br>00:22:56.480 out there for anyone that see she put  <br>00:22:59.120 all of the Rocks into the pain side to  <br>00:23:01.279 represent All Of The Addictive behaviors  <br>00:23:03.279 that this individual has now taken on  <br>00:23:06.320 right and now we've entered addicted  <br>00:23:10.039 brain by which I mean that we've changed  <br>00:23:12.919 our honic or Joy set point to the side  <br>00:23:17.440 of pain now we need more and more of our  <br>00:23:21.240 drug in more potent forms not to get  <br>00:23:24.520 high and feel good but just to level the  <br>00:23:28.000 balance feel normal and this is not  <br>00:23:29.720 going to be enough to level the balance  <br>00:23:31.720 I would have to like keep filling this  <br>00:23:34.200 much more than this container can hold  <br>00:23:36.600 and that would be in Pursuit really of  <br>00:23:38.480 just trying to level that balance so  <br>00:23:40.720 that we can feel normal and when we're  <br>00:23:42.200 not using we're walking around with a  <br>00:23:44.559 balance tilted toward the side of pain  <br>00:23:47.120 experiencing the universal symptoms of  <br>00:23:49.520 withdrawal from any addictive substance  <br>00:23:52.159 or behavior which are anxiety  <br>00:23:55.080 irritability insomnia depression and  <br>00:23:58.120 crav  <br>00:23:59.360 so if I managed to get enough vodka  <br>00:24:01.799 whiskey rum and pour it into the  <br>00:24:03.840 pleasure side of the scale now that all  <br>00:24:05.360 the rocks are in the pain side of the  <br>00:24:06.720 scale I managed to outweigh  <br>00:24:09.120 it it would it would what would then  <br>00:24:11.960 happen more rocks more rocks would be  <br>00:24:14.240 added yes more so momentarily yeah I  <br>00:24:17.640 would maybe be in a little bit of  <br>00:24:19.279 pleasure yes but then my brain would  <br>00:24:21.000 remove those docking stations again  <br>00:24:22.679 remove more of them and more rocks would  <br>00:24:24.360 go in and I'd slam  <br>00:24:26.000 down on the pain side again which means  <br>00:24:28.399 I need more alcohol to try and get up to  <br>00:24:30.799 pleasure SL okay so really you want to  <br>00:24:33.679 you want to like dopamine fast you need  <br>00:24:37.440 you need to just balance this and this  <br>00:24:39.080 is so difficult because of the world we  <br>00:24:40.480 live in it's almost it's it's it's funny  <br>00:24:42.880 enough because this little scales  <br>00:24:44.559 experiment um analogy here has given me  <br>00:24:46.960 a huge amount of empathy for people that  <br>00:24:48.159 are addicts oh gosh I'm so glad you said  <br>00:24:50.520 that because I think that is the key to  <br>00:24:53.799 empathy for the disease of addiction as  <br>00:24:56.520 well as for people with the disease  <br>00:24:57.919 having empathy for themselves is  <br>00:25:00.399 recognizing that on some level it it's  <br>00:25:04.799 it's out of their control right because  <br>00:25:07.120 when we are tilted to the side of pain  <br>00:25:09.559 the overwhelming drive to restore a  <br>00:25:12.559 level balance or restore homeostasis as  <br>00:25:14.840 quickly as possible overwhelms any other  <br>00:25:18.000 rational thought about the consequences  <br>00:25:20.320 of my drug use right it's just like get  <br>00:25:22.799 back to the level position because if I  <br>00:25:25.240 do that I'll at least feel temporarily  <br>00:25:27.559 better  <br>00:25:29.399 one of the things this analogy also  <br>00:25:31.520 highlights for me is that people who are  <br>00:25:34.399 addicted aren't trying to self harm  <br>00:25:37.720 right and this is kind of the prevailing  <br>00:25:39.679 narrative that if you're like why would  <br>00:25:41.880 you do that to yourself right whereas  <br>00:25:43.720 when I look at this analogy I go  <br>00:25:45.480 actually what they're trying to do is  <br>00:25:47.840 to deal with pain and we're all trying  <br>00:25:50.440 to find ways to deal with our pain and  <br>00:25:53.240 but in this analogy what ultimately  <br>00:25:54.799 happens and I guess is what's happening  <br>00:25:56.240 with addicts is the way they're choosing  <br>00:25:58.000 to deal with their pain is becoming  <br>00:26:00.399 self-destructive and that's creating  <br>00:26:01.919 more pain right and it's this vicious  <br>00:26:04.080 downward cycle yes and I think that sort  <br>00:26:05.960 of reframing of what's going on there is  <br>00:26:07.600 really critical because again it begets  <br>00:26:09.159 more empathy absolutely I agree with you  <br>00:26:12.559 and and I think you know we this this  <br>00:26:15.480 metaphor it makes an assumption that we  <br>00:26:18.480 all start with a pleasure pain balance  <br>00:26:20.000 that's level with the ground but  <br>00:26:21.440 actually that's probably not true right  <br>00:26:24.399 some people at Baseline may actually be  <br>00:26:26.919 more depressed or more anxious or may  <br>00:26:29.080 have had life experiences that sets them  <br>00:26:31.360 up for a kind of chronic stress reaction  <br>00:26:34.760 and we know that people with  <br>00:26:35.919 co-occurring psychiatric disorders for  <br>00:26:37.799 example are at increased risk of  <br>00:26:39.799 developing addiction probably because  <br>00:26:41.559 they're reaching for that substance to  <br>00:26:43.960 self medicate their psychiatric problem  <br>00:26:47.600 the the issue with that is that it's not  <br>00:26:50.320 medicinal right it's not healing  <br>00:26:53.159 although in the short term substances  <br>00:26:56.159 can help with those kinds of feelings  <br>00:26:58.240 feelings of psychological and physical  <br>00:27:00.720 pain over time because of the way the  <br>00:27:03.760 brain adapts as we've  <br>00:27:06.320 discussed substances and other addictive  <br>00:27:09.200 behaviors just make psychiatric problems  <br>00:27:11.600 worse right as we drive ourselves  <br>00:27:13.880 further into the the kind of uh you know  <br>00:27:16.679 the pain side of the balance so is this  <br>00:27:18.520 why trauma often leads to addictive  <br>00:27:20.440 behaviors because the trauma has caused  <br>00:27:23.200 a a pain a stress and we're searching  <br>00:27:26.720 for ways to  <br>00:27:29.200 medicate that pain or stress yeah to  <br>00:27:31.279 numb ourselves to not be present in our  <br>00:27:33.640 reality and have to deal with what's  <br>00:27:35.559 going on there is dopamine what role is  <br>00:27:37.880 dopamine playing in it's all the same  <br>00:27:39.760 dopamine  <br>00:27:41.039 originally was to help us find those  <br>00:27:43.519 things that we need to survive food  <br>00:27:46.039 clothing shelter a mate we call those  <br>00:27:48.559 Natural Rewards but  <br>00:27:51.760 today that same reward pathway that  <br>00:27:54.720 relies on dopamine has been hijacked by  <br>00:27:57.440 all of these  <br>00:27:58.640 artificial rewards that our brain  <br>00:28:01.600 confuses as necessary for survival which  <br>00:28:05.080 is why people with severe addiction will  <br>00:28:07.840 be willing to lose you know not  <br>00:28:10.159 consciously but unconsciously their  <br>00:28:12.840 loved ones their homes their jobs  <br>00:28:15.480 everything they have in pursuit of their  <br>00:28:17.159 drug of choice it's because their brain  <br>00:28:19.399 has been hijacked and they now confuse  <br>00:28:23.080 the drug as necessary for survival the  <br>00:28:26.240 other thing about drugs is that they're  <br>00:28:28.399 incredibly potent they release a lot of  <br>00:28:30.440 dopamine all at once which again is  <br>00:28:32.919 confusing for our brain Natural Rewards  <br>00:28:36.519 require upfront effort where we do a lot  <br>00:28:38.720 of work and then we get a little bit of  <br>00:28:41.399 dopamine and that's what our brains  <br>00:28:43.200 evolved for I mean I can that makes  <br>00:28:45.399 sense in my own life when I'm most  <br>00:28:47.919 stressed or most challenged by something  <br>00:28:50.679 professionally is when I I immediately  <br>00:28:52.880 notice that my diet goes out the window  <br>00:28:54.840 I start eating things that are bad I  <br>00:28:56.279 actually stop going to the gym as much  <br>00:28:58.640 um and it's it be can form a bit of a  <br>00:29:01.320 downward spiral can't it I guess as  <br>00:29:03.080 we've kind of seen from the dopamine  <br>00:29:04.679 scale um can I can I get back to that  <br>00:29:07.760 your question though about trauma and  <br>00:29:09.440 stress so um there's a very series  <br>00:29:13.279 there's a very interesting series of  <br>00:29:14.840 experiments in rodents mice and rats  <br>00:29:18.960 where they first of all rodents very  <br>00:29:22.760 easily get addicted to cocaine they will  <br>00:29:25.279 press a lever for cocaine until  <br>00:29:27.440 exhaustion or death but if that cocaine  <br>00:29:31.039 is then taken away that behavior will  <br>00:29:34.720 extinguish which means that the mice  <br>00:29:37.200 will eventually just stop pressing the  <br>00:29:38.840 lever right because they're not getting  <br>00:29:40.120 any cocaine totally makes sense and then  <br>00:29:42.240 they'll go off and do something else in  <br>00:29:43.640 the cage but if they're then exposed to  <br>00:29:46.919 a very painful foot shock right so a  <br>00:29:50.159 very extreme physical pain which you  <br>00:29:52.159 could equate to a serious life stressor  <br>00:29:55.559 the first thing the rat will do is run  <br>00:29:58.320 over to the lever and start pressing for  <br>00:30:02.919 cocaine which tells us that once our  <br>00:30:06.120 brain has discovered a drug that  <br>00:30:08.679 releases a lot of dopamine in our reward  <br>00:30:12.279 pathway even after we stop using that  <br>00:30:15.480 drug if we are exposed to an extreme  <br>00:30:20.360 stressor our brain will tell us  <br>00:30:23.080 immediately go and do that thing that  <br>00:30:25.799 gives us a lot of dopamine because you  <br>00:30:28.000 are under stress and I need to be  <br>00:30:30.279 relieved of stress does that make sense  <br>00:30:32.080 makes perfect sense yeah so if you  <br>00:30:33.799 especially so if you discover your drug  <br>00:30:35.159 of choice when you're younger and it's  <br>00:30:36.799 food or it's pornography or if it's I  <br>00:30:39.840 don't know anything that really made you  <br>00:30:41.679 feel good for a moment a moment of  <br>00:30:43.640 pleasure that will always become in the  <br>00:30:46.519 case of these rodent  <br>00:30:48.960 experiments the thing you run back to  <br>00:30:51.519 when life gets hard right and we see  <br>00:30:54.039 that again and again in people in  <br>00:30:56.159 sustained recovery from addtion that  <br>00:30:59.600 when they are under stress that is a  <br>00:31:03.639 trigger potentially for them to relapse  <br>00:31:06.200 so they have to be really thoughtful in  <br>00:31:08.000 their lives for number one trying to  <br>00:31:10.039 avoid stressful situations and and by  <br>00:31:12.559 the way stress can come in many  <br>00:31:14.639 different forms there's a great acronym  <br>00:31:16.240 in in alcoholic synonymous called halt  <br>00:31:19.039 hungry angry lonely tired those kinds of  <br>00:31:23.880 stressors everyday stressors which we  <br>00:31:26.279 all experience hungry angry lonely tired  <br>00:31:29.480 can trigger us to want to use so people  <br>00:31:31.960 in recovery have to be really thoughtful  <br>00:31:33.760 about not getting too hungry not getting  <br>00:31:35.880 too angry not getting too lonely and not  <br>00:31:38.600 getting too tired at the end of this  <br>00:31:40.440 conversation I want to go through all of  <br>00:31:41.519 the sort of practical solutions that  <br>00:31:43.360 someone struggling with an addiction to  <br>00:31:44.760 social media pornography food whatever  <br>00:31:47.880 it might be um Can Implement to try and  <br>00:31:50.960 shift that cycle that they might be  <br>00:31:53.159 going through especially when they're  <br>00:31:54.519 halting hungry angry lonely or tired how  <br>00:31:57.399 often have you worked with addicts have  <br>00:31:59.320 you spent much time working with addicts  <br>00:32:00.840 directly oh my gosh yeah so that's the  <br>00:32:02.720 bulk of my career is working uh with  <br>00:32:05.679 people with all different kinds of  <br>00:32:07.000 addictions me an example of the most  <br>00:32:09.039 obscure the most I had a patient who was  <br>00:32:11.840 addicted to  <br>00:32:13.399 water I know hard hard to imagine you  <br>00:32:16.639 have to though understand her narrative  <br>00:32:19.480 so she had a very severe alcohol  <br>00:32:21.880 addiction she got into recovery from  <br>00:32:24.320 that addiction and gave up alcohol but  <br>00:32:26.919 she discovered that by drinking copious  <br>00:32:29.880 amounts of water she could become  <br>00:32:32.880 hyponic meaning that she could lower the  <br>00:32:36.360 sodium levels in her bloodstream which  <br>00:32:38.159 would then lead her to become delirious  <br>00:32:40.600 and so in her desire to just be checked  <br>00:32:42.720 out she would do that she would she  <br>00:32:45.080 would drink a large amounts of water  <br>00:32:48.240 she's doing okay no sadly she's not um  <br>00:32:51.600 she she ended up taking her own life so  <br>00:32:54.240 that was very sad  <br>00:32:59.720 gosh in that situation was there was  <br>00:33:02.760 there a root cause of that behavior  <br>00:33:04.440 pattern further Upstream some kind of  <br>00:33:06.639 trauma or experience that had set this  <br>00:33:09.120 sort of cascade cascading set of issues  <br>00:33:11.240 off yeah you know I'm just speaking  <br>00:33:14.039 broadly um for for some patients with  <br>00:33:17.120 severe addiction trauma is a huge Factor  <br>00:33:21.480 um especially severe Early Childhood  <br>00:33:24.000 trauma but there are also many folks we  <br>00:33:27.399 see  <br>00:33:28.399 who have kind of great parents and have  <br>00:33:31.159 had happy childhoods and have great  <br>00:33:34.159 social networks and and work that they  <br>00:33:36.720 enjoy and yet they still become addicted  <br>00:33:40.240 and that's because we again we are wired  <br>00:33:44.600 to consume as much as possible of  <br>00:33:47.880 whatever releases dopamine in our brains  <br>00:33:50.120 to have survived Evolution to this date  <br>00:33:53.519 and yet we're living in this world where  <br>00:33:55.320 we have access to so many drug aied  <br>00:33:58.519 substances and behaviors that we've all  <br>00:34:00.760 become vulnerable to this problem and  <br>00:34:02.960 the reason I highlight this is because  <br>00:34:05.360 one of the things that I think has  <br>00:34:06.760 happened in the field of addiction  <br>00:34:08.359 medicine that maybe isn't the best is  <br>00:34:12.320 that often times patients themselves as  <br>00:34:14.879 well as their providers are digging  <br>00:34:17.040 really deep to find the trauma or the  <br>00:34:20.639 reason that someone has become addicted  <br>00:34:23.760 and I think that that's important to do  <br>00:34:25.800 in some cases but in in other other  <br>00:34:28.079 cases it can lead to kind of  <br>00:34:30.239 manufacturing trauma where there really  <br>00:34:32.280 isn't any furthermore I would say that  <br>00:34:35.199 when a person is in the throws of their  <br>00:34:37.119 addiction they're not going to be able  <br>00:34:39.560 to really do the complex emotional  <br>00:34:42.199 processing of their trauma while they're  <br>00:34:44.520 still using their drug of choice that  <br>00:34:46.719 they really need to get out of that  <br>00:34:48.440 Vortex of addiction and get into some  <br>00:34:50.560 degree of recovery before you would even  <br>00:34:53.159 want to go tackle some of those early  <br>00:34:55.560 traumatic experiences how many people do  <br>00:34:58.240 you think are struggling with some form  <br>00:34:59.680 of  <br>00:35:00.640 addiction well if you think of addiction  <br>00:35:02.920 as a spectrum disorder right there's  <br>00:35:04.800 mild moderate and severe um and there's  <br>00:35:08.200 I would even say a kind of a pre-  <br>00:35:09.680 addiction state where we're all sort of  <br>00:35:11.359 dabbling in compulsive overc consumption  <br>00:35:14.079 I would say the vast majority of us like  <br>00:35:16.760 90 probably  <br>00:35:19.200 95% have some degree of compulsive over  <br>00:35:22.599 consumption and you know if and when it  <br>00:35:25.320 tips over into what we would call  <br>00:35:26.920 addiction there's not a brain scan or a  <br>00:35:29.160 blood test to assess that it's not like  <br>00:35:31.040 you know switching a light a light  <br>00:35:32.520 switch and it's like oh yeah now you  <br>00:35:33.680 have addiction um it's not like that  <br>00:35:36.200 it's you know it's a gradual often a  <br>00:35:37.920 gradual and Insidious thing and we don't  <br>00:35:40.280 in fact have a biological measurement of  <br>00:35:42.960 addiction we Bas it on what we call  <br>00:35:45.320 phenomenology which is patterns of  <br>00:35:47.200 behavior that re repeat themselves  <br>00:35:49.079 across time and broadly speaking the  <br>00:35:52.319 definition of addiction is the continued  <br>00:35:54.440 compulsive use of a substance or a  <br>00:35:57.079 behavior despite harm to self and or  <br>00:36:00.280 others and so you know that harm can be  <br>00:36:03.800 very subtle um or not right and it can  <br>00:36:07.560 be a judgment call interesting because  <br>00:36:10.839 we do throw the word Addiction around a  <br>00:36:12.400 lot in society but but really the most  <br>00:36:15.280 important part of that is to understand  <br>00:36:17.040 if it's harming yourself or someone else  <br>00:36:18.920 the behavior pattern yes that's right  <br>00:36:20.800 and to also recognize that we're not  <br>00:36:22.440 very good judges of that when we're  <br>00:36:24.160 chasing dopamine okay so we sometimes  <br>00:36:26.720 justify behaviors we have as being not  <br>00:36:29.119 harmful and it's fine and it's not  <br>00:36:30.480 impacting me at all and what do you mean  <br>00:36:32.240 exactly and we don't we're not very good  <br>00:36:34.079 at seeing true cause and effect honestly  <br>00:36:36.200 when it comes to these behaviors which  <br>00:36:38.240 is why often times people won't really  <br>00:36:40.319 see the harm until they've stopped using  <br>00:36:43.000 for a period of time in your book  <br>00:36:45.480 dopamine Nation you talk about an  <br>00:36:47.160 addiction that you had yes and it was  <br>00:36:49.160 really surprising to me because I would  <br>00:36:51.880 never have thought that being obsessed  <br>00:36:53.359 with erotic  <br>00:36:54.839 novels could be classified as an  <br>00:36:57.040 addiction  <br>00:36:59.839 what happened what was the behavior take  <br>00:37:01.440 me into that that phase of your life so  <br>00:37:04.400 I was in my early 40s um my kids were no  <br>00:37:08.200 longer little um I got a lot of my  <br>00:37:10.760 self-worth and identity from being a mom  <br>00:37:14.079 and my kids were sort of entering  <br>00:37:15.839 adolescence they were doing fine but  <br>00:37:18.160 they didn't need me as much um so I had  <br>00:37:20.880 kind of a grief reaction you know in  <br>00:37:22.560 response to that was trying to figure  <br>00:37:24.480 out you know how to navigate this next  <br>00:37:26.280 phase of my life I'd always been a  <br>00:37:28.640 reader and in particular a reader of  <br>00:37:30.640 novels um in my own way that was how as  <br>00:37:33.880 a child I self soothed was to escape  <br>00:37:36.240 into uh the Fantasy Life of novels um  <br>00:37:39.720 but I never had what what I would call a  <br>00:37:42.040 problem with it and then one day I heard  <br>00:37:44.880 another mother at school said that she  <br>00:37:46.640 was reading this great book it was  <br>00:37:48.160 called Twilight it was about these  <br>00:37:50.040 vampires and she was going on and on  <br>00:37:52.000 about it and I read it and I I can't  <br>00:37:53.960 tell you what it was but it was just  <br>00:37:55.400 like the the the key in my particular it  <br>00:37:57.880 was completely  <br>00:37:59.079 transporting it just released a lot of  <br>00:38:01.880 dope mean is all I can imagine in my  <br>00:38:03.720 brains reward pathway and so I read the  <br>00:38:06.119 whole series and then I read the series  <br>00:38:08.200 again and I read it again and of course  <br>00:38:10.440 by the third or fourth time it wasn't as  <br>00:38:13.000 you know reinforcing and I thought to  <br>00:38:14.839 myself I wonder if there are any more  <br>00:38:17.200 vampire romance novels and then for me  <br>00:38:20.240 the real Tipping Point was I got an  <br>00:38:22.079 e-reader I got a Kindle because what  <br>00:38:24.960 happened was I I even before I got the  <br>00:38:27.680 Kindle I started reading you know novels  <br>00:38:30.319 that I would say I would be slightly  <br>00:38:31.440 embarrassed to admit that I was reading  <br>00:38:33.640 like kind of bodice Ripper novels as  <br>00:38:36.280 time went on I I needed more and more  <br>00:38:39.319 like graphic kinds of descriptions in  <br>00:38:42.680 order to find it pleasurable and and by  <br>00:38:45.440 the way that's classic for the addiction  <br>00:38:48.880 narrative right where you start out with  <br>00:38:50.960 a little bit and it goes a long way and  <br>00:38:52.599 then over time you build up tolerance  <br>00:38:54.599 that's neuro adaptation the Gremlins  <br>00:38:57.560 pressing down on the pain side of  <br>00:38:58.720 balance now I need more of my drug in  <br>00:39:00.200 more potent forms to get the same effect  <br>00:39:02.760 gradually over time I started um reading  <br>00:39:06.280 you know more and more sort of graphic  <br>00:39:09.079 erotic sexualized versions of this novel  <br>00:39:12.560 and I would I was embarrassed so I would  <br>00:39:14.520 hide that I was reading them and that  <br>00:39:16.119 gets into the whole double life of  <br>00:39:17.640 addiction where now we're lying about  <br>00:39:19.720 our use we're we're using our drug over  <br>00:39:21.960 here but pretending like we're not so my  <br>00:39:24.319 kids or my husband would walk in the  <br>00:39:25.520 room and I would be you know hiding  <br>00:39:27.760 behind another book one book behind  <br>00:39:30.079 another book so it looked like I was  <br>00:39:32.319 reading something you know I don't know  <br>00:39:34.520 more  <br>00:39:36.720 sophisticated and then the Tipping Point  <br>00:39:38.800 for me came really when I got a Kindle  <br>00:39:40.920 or an e-reader and then my reading was  <br>00:39:43.560 totally Anonymous I could read these  <br>00:39:45.280 books anywhere any time no one knew what  <br>00:39:47.359 I was reading and as soon as I finished  <br>00:39:49.760 one um I could read another one and I  <br>00:39:53.359 almost overnight became a chain reader  <br>00:39:55.640 like literally when I was n doing  <br>00:39:58.160 something else that I had to do I was  <br>00:40:00.560 reading romance novels one after another  <br>00:40:03.160 after another um which meant I was you  <br>00:40:06.000 know less present for my kids less  <br>00:40:08.079 present for my husband I would often  <br>00:40:10.119 stay up till 2: 3 4 in the morning on a  <br>00:40:12.560 week night reading romance novels have  <br>00:40:15.040 to get up two hours later go to work  <br>00:40:17.400 exhausted not able to be present for my  <br>00:40:19.640 patience not enjoying my work gradually  <br>00:40:22.200 getting more depressed more irritable  <br>00:40:24.040 more anxious more insomnia we went on on  <br>00:40:27.520 a a family vacation with an family  <br>00:40:29.960 friends of ours everybody together at  <br>00:40:31.520 this beach house all the kids playing I  <br>00:40:33.599 was like hiding in a room reading  <br>00:40:35.000 romance novels so and this is exactly  <br>00:40:37.839 what happens with addiction is that our  <br>00:40:40.160 Focus Narrows and the things that we  <br>00:40:43.640 used to enjoy are no longer pleasurable  <br>00:40:45.920 only this one thing has salience for us  <br>00:40:48.720 we plan our whole whole day around  <br>00:40:50.599 getting it using it hiding our use um  <br>00:40:54.920 and that's what happened to me  <br>00:40:58.599 it's so interesting because I was as you  <br>00:41:00.280 were talking about that I was thinking  <br>00:41:01.319 about all the behaviors that I have that  <br>00:41:04.280 are maybe isolating me or you know I  <br>00:41:08.680 just even things like spending a lot of  <br>00:41:10.599 time on the internet just watching video  <br>00:41:12.720 after video after video on YouTube or um  <br>00:41:17.160 those kinds of things or just like  <br>00:41:18.680 spending tons of time in my WhatsApp  <br>00:41:20.520 group chat talking like roasting my  <br>00:41:22.960 friends about nothing right how do you  <br>00:41:24.760 know if like this is it's cuz on end of  <br>00:41:27.560 the spectrum I could say okay well  <br>00:41:28.680 that's harming my relationship with  <br>00:41:31.240 people in the real world but  <br>00:41:34.920 it's helping making me feel good and  <br>00:41:38.280 it's you know maybe helping me in  <br>00:41:40.480 another department because I'm learning  <br>00:41:42.200 more about vampires or you know like so  <br>00:41:46.319 like you know because there's there  <br>00:41:47.760 might be net harm somewhere else but  <br>00:41:50.680 then an upside over here which and then  <br>00:41:52.760 I start rationalizing this Behavior like  <br>00:41:55.280 how' you just distinguish between these  <br>00:41:57.599 behaviors and know what's bad and what's  <br>00:41:59.240 good you know what it's really hard um  <br>00:42:03.560 these digital devices are powerful tools  <br>00:42:07.079 but also very potent drugs there's no  <br>00:42:09.880 doubt that digital media lights up the  <br>00:42:13.160 same reward pathway as drugs and alcohol  <br>00:42:16.119 these devices and platforms were  <br>00:42:18.000 designed to be addictive that is to keep  <br>00:42:20.200 us scrolling and tapping long beyond  <br>00:42:23.800 what we plan for or what we want or even  <br>00:42:26.760 what's pleasurable I think we can all  <br>00:42:28.839 relate to using this  <br>00:42:31.599 medium to a point where we don't even  <br>00:42:35.000 like it anymore and yet have difficulty  <br>00:42:37.400 getting ourselves off of it that really  <br>00:42:39.599 speaks to the inherently reinforcing and  <br>00:42:43.680 cognitively adherent nature of this  <br>00:42:46.760 medium it is a drug and so you know if  <br>00:42:51.319 and when and how we're crossing into  <br>00:42:53.359 addictive  <br>00:42:54.400 use I think we need to be very Vig  <br>00:42:58.280 about whether that's happened in our  <br>00:43:00.319 lives and one of the ways to do that is  <br>00:43:03.079 actually to try cutting out that  <br>00:43:05.319 particular digital medium that website  <br>00:43:08.720 or that behavior for a period of time  <br>00:43:11.720 long enough to experience withdrawal  <br>00:43:14.960 potentially reset reward Pathways and  <br>00:43:17.200 then re-evaluate because when we're in  <br>00:43:19.640 the behavior as you yourself noted it's  <br>00:43:22.880 very easy to rationalize oh I need to do  <br>00:43:25.720 this for work oh I need need to do this  <br>00:43:27.520 to stay in touch with my friends oh I'm  <br>00:43:29.000 learning so much from this right and all  <br>00:43:32.520 of that may have been true initially but  <br>00:43:35.359 may not be that true anymore and what I  <br>00:43:39.119 often point to is the subtler signs of  <br>00:43:41.960 addiction which are things like  <br>00:43:43.400 depression anxiety in attention insomnia  <br>00:43:47.839 restlessness these can be early signals  <br>00:43:51.079 for our consumption entering into that  <br>00:43:54.200 addiction range but us not realizing it  <br>00:43:57.400 because again we don't see cause and  <br>00:44:00.520 effect which is why doing an experiment  <br>00:44:03.520 like I did with my romance novels you  <br>00:44:06.800 know following in the footsteps of my  <br>00:44:09.000 patients and taking the advice I give  <br>00:44:11.040 them and I gave my romance novels up for  <br>00:44:15.000 30 days right just to see like okay I  <br>00:44:18.520 think this is a problematic Behavior can  <br>00:44:20.359 I give it up how will I feel and the  <br>00:44:23.640 very first day that I the very first 24  <br>00:44:26.839 hours hours that I did not read any  <br>00:44:29.319 romance novel any novel at all I was  <br>00:44:32.599 astounded at my level of anxiety  <br>00:44:36.119 restlessness and utter insomnia I had  <br>00:44:39.839 completely unlearned the art of putting  <br>00:44:42.119 myself to sleep without this digital  <br>00:44:46.079 narrative and that lasted a good 10 to  <br>00:44:48.559 14 days completely mapping on with the  <br>00:44:50.960 amount of time it takes typically to get  <br>00:44:53.280 out of acute withdrawal that is to say  <br>00:44:55.559 for those neuro adapt PA Gremlins to hop  <br>00:44:57.960 off the pain side of the balance and for  <br>00:44:59.880 homeostasis to to begin to be re  <br>00:45:03.240 restored um but by the time I got to  <br>00:45:05.839 weeks three and four I felt not just  <br>00:45:09.000 better than I had in the first two weeks  <br>00:45:10.640 but actually better than I had felt in a  <br>00:45:12.480 really long time I enjoyed my kids more  <br>00:45:16.079 I was more present for them I enjoyed my  <br>00:45:18.760 husband more my work seemed salian again  <br>00:45:21.079 I had started to think oh maybe I should  <br>00:45:22.800 do something else you know maybe maybe I  <br>00:45:25.720 you know this work I've been doing it a  <br>00:45:26.800 long long time I don't it's not that  <br>00:45:28.359 interesting anymore all of a sudden it  <br>00:45:30.720 was interesting again right so you see  <br>00:45:33.440 the relativity of that honic pathway and  <br>00:45:36.760 how when we're doing that behavior or  <br>00:45:38.599 substance that's so reinforcing that  <br>00:45:40.559 everything else loses its salience we  <br>00:45:42.960 can really  <br>00:45:44.559 misidentify what is causing our  <br>00:45:47.680 irritability anxiety insomnia until we  <br>00:45:51.000 stop that substance for long enough to  <br>00:45:53.559 see its impact on our lives how is it  <br>00:45:55.800 making you feel because I think a lot of  <br>00:45:58.400 a lot of people can't understand how you  <br>00:45:59.880 could get addicted to a book I'm sure  <br>00:46:03.559 some people understand that but but for  <br>00:46:04.920 me it's not something I've ever become  <br>00:46:07.079 addicted to so how how did it feel was  <br>00:46:09.359 it like exciting is it arousing is it  <br>00:46:13.160 somewhere in  <br>00:46:14.319 between I mean I think that romance  <br>00:46:17.319 novels are essentially socially  <br>00:46:19.800 sanctioned pornography for women okay  <br>00:46:22.319 and the medium is narrative and if  <br>00:46:24.480 you're a person for whom narrative is a  <br>00:46:26.359 powerful drug as it is for me a story a  <br>00:46:28.960 narrative a fiction um very potent since  <br>00:46:32.000 I was a child then you know it was a  <br>00:46:35.119 natural that that that would be the  <br>00:46:37.160 thing that I would get addicted to and  <br>00:46:39.000 basically just like we've hacked and  <br>00:46:41.800 bioengineered everything to make it more  <br>00:46:44.240 potent I mean people there's a formula  <br>00:46:46.400 for writing romance novels like if you  <br>00:46:48.599 take a physical copy if you go to a  <br>00:46:50.400 store and you pick up a romance novel  <br>00:46:52.319 and you literally physically open it to  <br>00:46:54.520 2third of the way through you will get  <br>00:46:56.559 to the climactic scene pun intended  <br>00:46:59.559 right it's it's like it's  <br>00:47:01.480 engineered I mean I got to a point where  <br>00:47:05.000 I wouldn't even read it read after I  <br>00:47:06.800 wouldn't finish the book I would go on  <br>00:47:08.720 to the next book just to get to the  <br>00:47:10.400 climax part and then you'd move yeah and  <br>00:47:12.000 I wouldn't even read the danum ma or  <br>00:47:13.720 like what happens to the characters I  <br>00:47:15.480 didn't care you didn't care about no and  <br>00:47:17.839 also I didn't I got to point where I  <br>00:47:19.079 didn't care about the quality of the  <br>00:47:20.240 writing or the depth of the car it  <br>00:47:22.240 didn't matter it was it was the drug it  <br>00:47:24.440 was that moment I was looking for and  <br>00:47:26.640 you know there are a lot of free books  <br>00:47:28.400 on Amazon some some of which are high  <br>00:47:30.400 quality and some of which are not but  <br>00:47:32.119 like you know any good drug dealer knows  <br>00:47:33.800 free samples that's the way you hook  <br>00:47:35.599 people I would search for these free  <br>00:47:37.440 samples and that's part of it too like  <br>00:47:39.000 the searching for the drug so the  <br>00:47:40.920 Working The Upfront work you do for the  <br>00:47:43.160 drug is part of the drug right it's all  <br>00:47:46.680 that you know the machinations and the  <br>00:47:48.760 hiding and the this and the that that  <br>00:47:51.000 gets to be part of like all of the  <br>00:47:53.160 rituals surrounding it as you were  <br>00:47:55.200 talking as well I thought about work and  <br>00:47:57.000 work addiction yes because you earlier  <br>00:47:59.680 used the term excessive consumption and  <br>00:48:02.480 when I think about work even my work I  <br>00:48:04.200 Think Jesus I excessively consume work I  <br>00:48:08.040 start so many bloody businesses and  <br>00:48:10.400 invest in so many things and if you look  <br>00:48:12.440 to that behavior objectively if you're  <br>00:48:13.920 like an alien looking down at me you'd  <br>00:48:15.280 go this guy's got a [ __ ] problem do  <br>00:48:17.480 you know what I mean you think you think  <br>00:48:18.960 that's funny joking you  <br>00:48:24.480 know I feel for you and it's funny cuz  <br>00:48:27.640 in society we then those people are  <br>00:48:29.760 reinforced we clap that's right we clap  <br>00:48:32.559 we got this guy's not sleeping he's  <br>00:48:33.880 working 18 hours a day clap clap clap  <br>00:48:36.800 give him a trophy an award name a thing  <br>00:48:39.280 after him or her or right you know um  <br>00:48:42.960 and it's just really interesting that  <br>00:48:44.440 that that addiction of work and you tell  <br>00:48:46.880 me if it is it can be an addiction it's  <br>00:48:48.559 certainly in the scale of one end being  <br>00:48:50.240 sort of consumption excessive  <br>00:48:52.000 consumption in the other hand being  <br>00:48:53.079 addiction it's on there somewhere people  <br>00:48:55.520 can get addicted to work  <br>00:48:57.280 and part of the reason is that we've  <br>00:48:59.000 drug aied work right when when I say  <br>00:49:01.040 drug aied what do I mean we've made it  <br>00:49:02.720 more potent and this is true for all all  <br>00:49:04.760 these drugs we've made them more potent  <br>00:49:06.760 more novel more Bountiful meaning  <br>00:49:09.319 there's more of it and more accessible  <br>00:49:11.640 so if we if we break that down with work  <br>00:49:13.400 how is work more potent well certain  <br>00:49:16.359 types of work are more reinforcing not  <br>00:49:18.520 all types of work so for example Works  <br>00:49:21.880 work White Collar work is often now  <br>00:49:24.960 associated with stock options and  <br>00:49:27.079 bonuses right um there's often like a  <br>00:49:29.920 social media aspect to it or maybe even  <br>00:49:32.880 a Fame aspect or as you point out those  <br>00:49:35.280 are our cultural Heroes right so you get  <br>00:49:37.640 all this you know agulation for being a  <br>00:49:41.200 workaholic and that also because we're  <br>00:49:43.599 such social creatures right and human  <br>00:49:45.359 connection stimulates dope mean that  <br>00:49:47.480 that also makes work more of a potent  <br>00:49:50.760 drug personal brand right so you're  <br>00:49:52.760 LinkedIn oh my God this person got a  <br>00:49:54.880 promotion we all clap we the likes the  <br>00:49:57.200 comments you're amazing the agulation  <br>00:49:58.720 the a as you said the awards the  <br>00:50:00.720 trophies and then you've got um the fact  <br>00:50:04.040 the fact of novelty so once we've  <br>00:50:06.640 exposed our brains enough times to a  <br>00:50:09.520 certain drug as I said we develop  <br>00:50:11.079 tolerance right and then we need more  <br>00:50:13.760 potent forms or novel forms one of the  <br>00:50:15.960 ways we overcome tolerance is by taking  <br>00:50:18.799 our drug and then changing it slightly  <br>00:50:20.760 like adding a little new molecule on  <br>00:50:23.280 this chemical right or on the Internet  <br>00:50:25.920 you know when we're searching videos we  <br>00:50:27.720 want something similar to what we liked  <br>00:50:29.359 before but just a little bit different  <br>00:50:31.240 and that's what the algorithm does  <br>00:50:32.480 automatically right it offers oh you  <br>00:50:34.359 should check this out oh how about this  <br>00:50:35.799 oh check that out right and that engages  <br>00:50:37.680 our treasure seeking function we're  <br>00:50:39.319 looking for that that novel thing but  <br>00:50:41.480 that's not too novel right it has to be  <br>00:50:43.640 in our category of things we like and I  <br>00:50:45.520 think for work we have that too like  <br>00:50:47.160 there are so many ways now that people  <br>00:50:48.680 can engage in their work and it's not  <br>00:50:50.240 all bad that it's novel but you know  <br>00:50:52.640 certain types of work it makes it very  <br>00:50:54.480 enticing then you have quantity  <br>00:50:57.160 right I mean work never ends there's  <br>00:50:59.160 like no natural stopping point for work  <br>00:51:01.880 you know you do a line of cocaine you  <br>00:51:04.079 run out of money you run out of cocaine  <br>00:51:05.920 you're done right but that's not true  <br>00:51:08.720 for work everywhere anytime and then  <br>00:51:11.799 that gets to  <br>00:51:12.880 accessibility one of the biggest risk  <br>00:51:14.960 factors for addiction to any drug or  <br>00:51:16.880 behavior is simple access we know that  <br>00:51:19.559 if you grow up in a neighborhood where  <br>00:51:21.000 drugs are sold on a street corner you're  <br>00:51:22.960 more likely to try them more likely to  <br>00:51:24.680 get addicted if you live in a world  <br>00:51:27.119 where you have access to work  <br>00:51:29.839 24/7 you're more likely to expose your  <br>00:51:32.960 brain to more work and more likely to  <br>00:51:34.440 get addicted to work again especially if  <br>00:51:36.119 it's got all those other reinforcing  <br>00:51:38.680 qualities this is probably in part why  <br>00:51:41.079 people quit their  <br>00:51:42.720 jobs you mean if they just get  <br>00:51:44.599 overwhelmed or it's it's partially why  <br>00:51:46.440 people can never quit but I think it's  <br>00:51:48.359 important to make a distinction between  <br>00:51:49.960 work that's reinforcing in those ways  <br>00:51:52.640 and then work that's completely not  <br>00:51:55.160 reinforcing yeah  <br>00:51:57.280 alienating mind-numbing work in which  <br>00:52:00.720 the the actual task is separated from  <br>00:52:03.359 the meaning of a task I mean they quit  <br>00:52:05.559 their jobs either in search of more  <br>00:52:07.000 dopamine so if I'm working in a job  <br>00:52:09.319 where I don't know maybe it once gave me  <br>00:52:11.040 dopamine and now it's become monotonous  <br>00:52:13.240 and the same right I I need to quit to  <br>00:52:15.640 go find but there's novelty for you  <br>00:52:17.559 that's right yeah and that's true people  <br>00:52:19.799 many people change jobs every two to  <br>00:52:21.599 three years I I recently read that the  <br>00:52:24.000 the average life of a business now is  <br>00:52:26.200 like 15 years whereas you know 50 years  <br>00:52:29.559 ago it was 50 years and there's all this  <br>00:52:32.160 turnover all this churn chasing novelty  <br>00:52:35.200 also you know I I do want to emphasize  <br>00:52:36.920 that people who are in work that's not  <br>00:52:38.920 like intrinsically rewarding but is the  <br>00:52:41.599 opposite kind of soul sucking that's  <br>00:52:44.319 also a risk factor for addiction because  <br>00:52:46.200 people just wait till the end of the day  <br>00:52:47.680 till they can go home and then use a  <br>00:52:50.079 drug to numb themselves from the stress  <br>00:52:52.720 of work so it's it's plausible that  <br>00:52:55.119 people who are in lower pleasure jobs  <br>00:52:57.760 are more likely to be overweight or  <br>00:52:59.720 addicted or dependent on alcohol yeah or  <br>00:53:02.640 simply opt out of the workforce as many  <br>00:53:04.599 young men are doing now in the United  <br>00:53:06.280 States and what we know from data that's  <br>00:53:08.640 been collected is many of them are  <br>00:53:09.960 playing video games right they've just  <br>00:53:11.720 completely opted out of the workforce I  <br>00:53:14.119 guess this in part explains why there's  <br>00:53:15.839 a drinking culture that's associated  <br>00:53:18.400 with people who are potentially lower  <br>00:53:21.200 class um because they're doing um  <br>00:53:25.559 potentially  <br>00:53:27.480 less pleasurable work  <br>00:53:30.400 and they're therefore they if we think  <br>00:53:33.160 about the scale that they would then end  <br>00:53:35.160 up in the pub after work you know maybe  <br>00:53:38.040 that's partially true but even people  <br>00:53:40.280 doing like doctors and lawyers they're  <br>00:53:42.520 are oh okay yeah equal rates of  <br>00:53:44.799 alcoholism among those groups I think  <br>00:53:47.839 what's happening there though is that  <br>00:53:49.280 the nature of the work is just so  <br>00:53:51.359 stressful whether it's white collar or  <br>00:53:53.160 blue collar that there's this kind of  <br>00:53:55.000 work hard play hard right I'm going to  <br>00:53:56.799 work all day and at the end of the day  <br>00:53:58.119 I'm going to reward myself so now you've  <br>00:53:59.680 got a pleasure pain balance that's going  <br>00:54:01.119 pleasure pain pleasure pain and and  <br>00:54:02.559 remember the biological definition of  <br>00:54:04.960 stress is any deviation from  <br>00:54:08.079 neutrality so that every time our brain  <br>00:54:11.440 has to work to restore a level balance  <br>00:54:14.079 we're actually triggering our stress  <br>00:54:15.960 response triggering our own adrenaline  <br>00:54:18.559 it's stressful to have to restore the  <br>00:54:21.200 balance from those extremes of Pleasure  <br>00:54:23.359 and Pain I read in um your book you were  <br>00:54:25.640 talking about how different behaviors  <br>00:54:27.559 and sort of chemicals and substances  <br>00:54:29.240 have different impacts and I was on page  <br>00:54:31.520 50 of dopamin nation in a study of mice  <br>00:54:34.359 sex increases the release of dopamine by  <br>00:54:36.359 100% And amphetamines which is like  <br>00:54:39.359 drugs right hardcore drugs increases it  <br>00:54:42.079 by 1,000% by this accounting one hit of  <br>00:54:45.400 a meth pipe is equal to 10 orgasms yes  <br>00:54:48.680 it's interesting to think about that the  <br>00:54:50.760 different behaviors we have and how  <br>00:54:52.440 they'll have a bigger impact on our  <br>00:54:53.839 dopamine is there like any in an in in  <br>00:54:58.160 typical order of things that are like  <br>00:54:59.920 extremely dopamine inducing and things  <br>00:55:01.680 that aren't what's it like the top and  <br>00:55:03.799 bottom of the list but in your view you  <br>00:55:06.599 know I really think that it depends on  <br>00:55:09.680 the person and we've got to look at drug  <br>00:55:11.920 of choice right I mean potent drugs like  <br>00:55:15.799 methamphetamine like opioids like  <br>00:55:17.839 alcohol like nicotine like cannabis um  <br>00:55:21.400 are are going to be very reinforcing for  <br>00:55:25.000 many people but not for all people and  <br>00:55:28.000 most people do have their one drug that  <br>00:55:30.200 they sort of prefer above all others so  <br>00:55:33.880 although generally speaking intoxicants  <br>00:55:36.039 release a lot of dopamine in the reward  <br>00:55:37.920 pathway um I think every person is going  <br>00:55:40.799 to be different and also we we don't  <br>00:55:42.920 really have good ways of measuring  <br>00:55:44.839 absolute values of dopamine in human  <br>00:55:47.520 beings right we can do that in rats but  <br>00:55:50.039 we can't really do that in humans it's  <br>00:55:51.960 it's relative values I've got this um  <br>00:55:54.640 picture here which shows what looks like  <br>00:55:56.720 brain scans in uh normal person but then  <br>00:56:00.240 in someone who's addicted to different  <br>00:56:01.880 substances I'll put this on the screen  <br>00:56:03.119 and I'll link it below in the  <br>00:56:04.440 description for anyone that needs it and  <br>00:56:06.119 wants to see it but it effectively shows  <br>00:56:08.319 the impact that like cocaine has on the  <br>00:56:10.160 brain meth um alcohol and heroin what is  <br>00:56:13.920 what is going on here so the red in this  <br>00:56:16.640 image represents dopamine transmission  <br>00:56:19.720 okay so how much dope mean is being  <br>00:56:21.520 released from the pr synaptic neuron  <br>00:56:23.480 Crossing that synapse binding to  <br>00:56:25.520 receptors on the Sy aptic neuron how  <br>00:56:27.319 much dopamine is kind of swirling around  <br>00:56:29.520 in the reward pathway part of the brain  <br>00:56:32.599 and what this image shows is that on the  <br>00:56:35.640 left hand side in healthy control  <br>00:56:37.880 subjects who do not have addiction  <br>00:56:40.760 there's plenty of red right so there's  <br>00:56:43.160 plenty of dopamine Transmission in the  <br>00:56:45.559 reward pathway specifically here in the  <br>00:56:48.039 nucleus accumbens but if you look at the  <br>00:56:50.680 right hand column you'll see that in  <br>00:56:52.960 these individuals who have been using  <br>00:56:55.319 cocaine meth amphetamine alcohol and  <br>00:56:57.720 heroin in addictive ways there's almost  <br>00:57:01.039 no red which means there's decreased or  <br>00:57:05.480 below normal levels of dopamine  <br>00:57:08.799 transmission they are in a chronic  <br>00:57:11.760 dopamine deficit  <br>00:57:14.920 State this is evidence of the brain  <br>00:57:18.880 trying to  <br>00:57:20.880 compensate for too much dopamine being  <br>00:57:24.160 triggered by down regulating its own  <br>00:57:27.119 dopamine production and transmission not  <br>00:57:29.319 just to Baseline but below  <br>00:57:31.599 Baseline and importantly these  <br>00:57:34.400 individuals who are addicted to these  <br>00:57:36.440 substances these brain scans were done  <br>00:57:39.079 two weeks after they stopped  <br>00:57:41.599 using oh wow yeah which tells us that  <br>00:57:45.079 this dop dopamine deficit State persists  <br>00:57:48.520 for some period of Time how long well it  <br>00:57:51.960 depends on the person but we know at  <br>00:57:53.839 least from this experiment that the  <br>00:57:55.799 first two weeks are this persistent  <br>00:57:58.480 dopamine deficit state which is  <br>00:58:00.680 consistent with acute withdrawal right  <br>00:58:03.240 people feel when they first stop their  <br>00:58:05.039 drug of choice they feel terrible right  <br>00:58:07.880 they experience all of the symptoms of  <br>00:58:10.119 physical withdrawal that correspond with  <br>00:58:12.400 that particular drug they were using  <br>00:58:14.599 usually the opposite of what the drug  <br>00:58:16.160 did plus the universal symptoms of  <br>00:58:18.480 withdrawal from any addictive substance  <br>00:58:20.240 or behavior anxiety irritability  <br>00:58:22.960 insomnia depression and craving now if  <br>00:58:25.520 they can get through the first 10 to 14  <br>00:58:28.240 days what we see clinically is those  <br>00:58:31.799 acute withdrawal symptoms slowly start  <br>00:58:34.480 to get better and we think that that is  <br>00:58:37.319 mapping on to regenerating dopamine  <br>00:58:40.920 Transmission in the reward pathway and  <br>00:58:43.640 if they can make it to a month that's  <br>00:58:46.000 usually the point for for on average in  <br>00:58:48.920 based on clinical experience when people  <br>00:58:51.359 really can start to get out of that  <br>00:58:54.319 constant state of craving for their drug  <br>00:58:56.359 of choice and begin to see some light at  <br>00:58:58.680 the end of the tunnel for what their  <br>00:59:00.200 lives might look like if they can  <br>00:59:03.039 maintain abstinence from their drug and  <br>00:59:05.280 we can't just inject or drink dopamine I  <br>00:59:07.960 mean I guess that would be like drinking  <br>00:59:09.079 alcohol we can't just artificially mess  <br>00:59:11.640 with the the balances to try and restore  <br>00:59:13.240 the dopamine levels in an addict can we  <br>00:59:15.079 can't just add a little bit of dopamine  <br>00:59:16.640 yeah it's it's a great question because  <br>00:59:18.760 we have some natural experiments that  <br>00:59:21.119 suggest what what might happen if we do  <br>00:59:23.000 that so as I mentioned before people  <br>00:59:25.000 with Parkinson's have depletion of DOP  <br>00:59:27.280 mean in the substan [ __ ] That's What  <br>00:59:29.559 Causes That that motor disease the  <br>00:59:32.480 treatment for it is to give L Doopa  <br>00:59:36.240 which is a dopamine precursor if I were  <br>00:59:38.400 to give you a spoonful of dopamine it  <br>00:59:39.799 would do absolutely nothing because it  <br>00:59:41.000 doesn't cross into the bra the brain it  <br>00:59:42.880 doesn't cross the blood brain barrier  <br>00:59:44.520 but I could give you lopa which is a  <br>00:59:46.839 precursor chemical that would cross your  <br>00:59:48.960 blood brain barrier and get turned into  <br>00:59:51.520 dopamine and then diffusely bind  <br>00:59:54.079 dopamine receptors in your brain in the  <br>00:59:56.240 reward pathway but also in the movement  <br>00:59:58.880 Pathways when we give patients with  <br>01:00:02.119 Parkinson's dopamine in this form that  <br>01:00:06.319 can temporarily improve their movements  <br>01:00:08.880 but in about one in four Parkinson's  <br>01:00:11.400 patients they will develop a denovo  <br>01:00:14.559 addictive disorder shopping addiction  <br>01:00:17.359 sex addiction other types of addiction  <br>01:00:20.599 because we have the same problem we are  <br>01:00:23.760 stimulating  <br>01:00:26.119 the reward pathway with dopamine that is  <br>01:00:29.599 ingested exogenously from the  <br>01:00:32.680 outside and our brain reads that as oh  <br>01:00:35.559 boy got to compensate by downregulating  <br>01:00:38.559 dopamine transmission to below Baseline  <br>01:00:41.400 which then puts us in that addiction  <br>01:00:43.280 Vortex does that make sense it does so  <br>01:00:45.440 we have to I mean it tells me that we  <br>01:00:47.520 have to live lives in a certain sense of  <br>01:00:51.839 we have to live our lives in a certain  <br>01:00:53.160 sort of  <br>01:00:54.680 homeostasis and  <br>01:00:56.440 it's so easy not to in the world we live  <br>01:00:58.799 in it's like it's like impossible to  <br>01:01:00.559 live in a perfect homeostasis balance in  <br>01:01:04.359 the world we live in right even more  <br>01:01:07.640 than having to try to live within this  <br>01:01:09.839 sort of narrow range of homeostasis in  <br>01:01:12.400 the world we live in today we probably  <br>01:01:13.920 have to intentionally do things that are  <br>01:01:16.599 painful do things that are hard pleasure  <br>01:01:19.480 pain balance like we learn that when we  <br>01:01:21.839 press on the pleasure side of the  <br>01:01:23.920 balance like with alcohol or pornography  <br>01:01:26.880 or romance novels or cannabis or  <br>01:01:28.720 whatever it is right no sooner does that  <br>01:01:31.640 happen than our brain adapts by those  <br>01:01:35.160 neuro adaptation Gremlins hopping on the  <br>01:01:36.920 pain side of the balance to bring it  <br>01:01:38.319 level again but they like it on the  <br>01:01:39.680 balance so they don't get off right when  <br>01:01:41.400 it's level they stay on until we're  <br>01:01:43.079 tilted an equal an opposite amount to  <br>01:01:45.359 the side of pain that's the come down  <br>01:01:46.760 the hangover Etc but it turns out the  <br>01:01:49.520 opposite is also true if we  <br>01:01:51.039 intentionally press on the pain side of  <br>01:01:53.279 the balance for example with exercise or  <br>01:01:56.480 an ice cold water bath or intermittent  <br>01:01:58.760 fasting those Gremlins will hop on the  <br>01:02:01.119 pleasure side of the balance and we will  <br>01:02:03.119 get our dopamine indirectly by paying  <br>01:02:05.640 for it up front and there are studies in  <br>01:02:09.119 humans showing that when humans expose  <br>01:02:12.880 themselves to exercise for  <br>01:02:15.039 example dopamine levels gradually rise  <br>01:02:18.200 over the latter half of the exercise and  <br>01:02:20.440 then when the exercise stops dopamine  <br>01:02:22.920 levels will remain elevated for hours  <br>01:02:25.599 after afterwards before going back down  <br>01:02:28.200 to the Baseline level position without  <br>01:02:31.079 ever going into that dopamine deficit  <br>01:02:33.160 state so it's a great way to get our  <br>01:02:35.279 dopamine in directly because it's much  <br>01:02:37.880 less vulnerable to that compulsive  <br>01:02:41.200 craving phenomenon of overuse so you're  <br>01:02:43.400 not going to get an exercise come down  <br>01:02:46.599 you can butc and people can get addicted  <br>01:02:49.920 to exercise right but typically it's  <br>01:02:52.480 it's very unusual because The Upfront  <br>01:02:55.240 cost  <br>01:02:56.440 to to do the work and endure the pain of  <br>01:02:59.720 exercise in the first place mitigates  <br>01:03:02.880 our vulnerability to an exercise  <br>01:03:04.960 addiction and in general H okay CU it's  <br>01:03:06.960 so hard to do that it's going to be it's  <br>01:03:09.119 not like pulling a lever on a slot  <br>01:03:10.559 machine or clicking on a porn website is  <br>01:03:13.599 difficult yes okay so fighting for the  <br>01:03:16.480 dopamine  <br>01:03:18.599 is insulates us against the chance of an  <br>01:03:21.279 addiction having to really fight hard  <br>01:03:22.640 for it okay yeah and this kind of  <br>01:03:24.160 explains I guess in part why  <br>01:03:26.559 I pulled out some stats ahead of our  <br>01:03:28.400 conversation today that from 1996 to  <br>01:03:31.880 2008 participation in ultramarathons has  <br>01:03:35.400 increased by  <br>01:03:39.240 1,676 the ice bath Market is expected to  <br>01:03:42.440 rise from 350 million in 2024 to to  <br>01:03:45.640 nearly half a billion by 2030 the number  <br>01:03:49.279 of people taking part in obstacle course  <br>01:03:51.200 races like tough mut or hrock etc etc  <br>01:03:54.319 has increased by almost 7x from 2010 to  <br>01:03:58.119 2017 it seems like in society there's  <br>01:04:00.359 this counter movement towards people  <br>01:04:02.440 seeking out hard dopamine chasing pain  <br>01:04:06.039 yeah those are amazing I didn't know  <br>01:04:07.480 that those are amazing numbers um you  <br>01:04:10.000 know in general there's a part of me  <br>01:04:11.640 that wants to say well that's a good  <br>01:04:13.279 thing um but there there's another part  <br>01:04:15.839 of me that's wary also because we're so  <br>01:04:18.599 good at drug aying everything that we do  <br>01:04:21.319 that there's a way in which these types  <br>01:04:23.359 of behaviors can also be drug aied right  <br>01:04:26.160 made more potent with all of the  <br>01:04:28.400 technology the way that we count  <br>01:04:30.160 ourselves the leaderboards the social  <br>01:04:32.799 comparisons all of that takes this thing  <br>01:04:34.960 which is really in its natural state  <br>01:04:38.079 kind of impervious to addiction like you  <br>01:04:40.359 just typically wouldn't get addicted to  <br>01:04:42.520 these types of painful physical  <br>01:04:44.960 activities you would do what you needed  <br>01:04:46.920 to do for survival but we've managed to  <br>01:04:49.839 make them addictive in all these  <br>01:04:51.240 different ways I still think it's a  <br>01:04:53.799 better way to get your dopamine like I  <br>01:04:55.400 really encourage exercise we always talk  <br>01:04:57.799 about movement as medicine and in  <br>01:05:00.240 general our our life is so convenient so  <br>01:05:02.960 easy so passive so sedentary that I'm  <br>01:05:05.920 telling patients all the time you know  <br>01:05:07.799 get up off the couch move your body walk  <br>01:05:10.079 around the block I think that's the  <br>01:05:12.480 bigger obstacle right now is just  <br>01:05:14.319 getting people to move but I do think we  <br>01:05:16.920 need to be wary of not going too far in  <br>01:05:19.440 the direction of like the ultra Ultra  <br>01:05:21.799 Ultra whatever it is so what is a better  <br>01:05:23.880 way to live if we're trying to optimize  <br>01:05:25.760 happiness and to keep our dopamine in  <br>01:05:27.279 balance and not have the crashes Etc and  <br>01:05:29.400 come downs and hangover what is a  <br>01:05:31.839 optimal way to live our lives do we have  <br>01:05:33.279 to look back at our caveman ancestors  <br>01:05:36.000 and live like them I think that part of  <br>01:05:39.640 the problem is that we've  <br>01:05:41.680 organized Our Lives now around  <br>01:05:45.960 rewards almost everything that we do is  <br>01:05:49.160 predicated on the Feelgood moment we'll  <br>01:05:52.640 have at the end of it and because of  <br>01:05:55.480 that that we  <br>01:05:56.960 are missing out on the  <br>01:05:59.599 process we're projecting our psyche  <br>01:06:02.440 forward into the future toward the  <br>01:06:04.480 reward and not able to really be here in  <br>01:06:08.279 the moment okay this is going to be  <br>01:06:10.000 sound weird I'm going to give you a  <br>01:06:11.000 weird example so driving over here today  <br>01:06:13.440 I found I was nervous for this interview  <br>01:06:16.880 and in a way looking forward to it but  <br>01:06:19.279 in a way wanting it to be over right and  <br>01:06:22.760 and in seeing that in myself I thought  <br>01:06:24.640 that's so sad like that's that's so sad  <br>01:06:27.079 that we live our lives that way myself  <br>01:06:29.000 included always this weird blend of  <br>01:06:31.920 wanting whatever we're doing to be over  <br>01:06:34.119 so that in a way we can just go hide and  <br>01:06:35.760 do whatever that self- steem thing is  <br>01:06:37.880 that we do where we're safe and we're  <br>01:06:39.799 like you know stimulating ourselves in  <br>01:06:41.839 some way and then I thought well what if  <br>01:06:44.559 I knew that I was going to die right  <br>01:06:47.599 after this going come off really weird  <br>01:06:50.480 now but what if I knew that I was  <br>01:06:52.520 actually going to die right after our  <br>01:06:54.119 conversation today  <br>01:06:56.359 that totally changes my perspective  <br>01:06:58.119 doesn't it because this time you and I  <br>01:07:00.240 have that's all I got it's over for me  <br>01:07:02.559 when this so this this conversation is  <br>01:07:04.599 it I really better be right here right  <br>01:07:06.599 now and really taking joy in whatever  <br>01:07:10.760 you and I can find together and and I  <br>01:07:13.119 think the more we can do that the better  <br>01:07:17.079 what's happening there you're removing  <br>01:07:18.799 the thought of the outcome the rewards  <br>01:07:20.799 the potential you know failure or  <br>01:07:22.599 whatever and you're focusing on just  <br>01:07:24.359 being present and in doing so what is  <br>01:07:27.160 happening it's a great question and I've  <br>01:07:29.839 actually given this quite a lot of  <br>01:07:31.160 thought because I remember when I was in  <br>01:07:32.799 college and I you know met some like Zen  <br>01:07:36.599 people and they were like be here now be  <br>01:07:39.520 here now and I thought well whenever I'm  <br>01:07:42.880 here now I'm miserable like I I I don't  <br>01:07:45.880 like me and I don't like being in the  <br>01:07:48.200 world I I don't want to be here now I  <br>01:07:50.279 want to be somewhere else so I didn't  <br>01:07:53.520 really understand what they were getting  <br>01:07:55.200 at  <br>01:07:55.960 it really took me you know till I had  <br>01:07:58.279 lived quite a lot of life and had some  <br>01:08:00.319 you know some significant experiences  <br>01:08:02.760 and given it some thought that I  <br>01:08:04.200 realized oh be here now means be here  <br>01:08:07.599 now and be  <br>01:08:09.079 uncomfortable and be okay with being  <br>01:08:12.520 uncomfortable and being okay with not  <br>01:08:14.680 being able to  <br>01:08:16.520 control my pleasure or my pain or my  <br>01:08:19.479 comfort level but just being open to  <br>01:08:21.960 whatever comes and I think that's a  <br>01:08:24.198 really a key shift  <br>01:08:26.880 that I'm not trying to control my  <br>01:08:29.439 experience in the moment and that it's  <br>01:08:31.880 okay to be unhappy or Restless or  <br>01:08:35.679 uncomfortable and not trying to run away  <br>01:08:37.920 from that but just really turn and face  <br>01:08:39.719 it and embrace the discomfort which I  <br>01:08:42.640 also think is quite Universal I don't  <br>01:08:44.560 think I'm I'm alone in that and then the  <br>01:08:48.040 key piece about not not anticipating the  <br>01:08:50.679 reward is helps me be in the moment  <br>01:08:54.880 right because I'm not just waiting for  <br>01:08:56.640 the good thing to come after I'm saying  <br>01:08:58.719 to myself imagine there's nothing good  <br>01:09:00.319 coming after nothing at all right  <br>01:09:02.600 there's just there aren't rewards this  <br>01:09:04.359 is it and then also being able to say  <br>01:09:07.520 and it's okay if in the moment like it's  <br>01:09:10.600 not great like I I can Embrace that you  <br>01:09:13.520 know I can be unhappy or Restless or  <br>01:09:18.000 anxious or whatever it is and then when  <br>01:09:20.759 I do that you know I feel like there's a  <br>01:09:23.399 funny funny thing that happens and all  <br>01:09:25.158 the sudden I I'm not as anxious right  <br>01:09:28.759 and I am present and it there is some  <br>01:09:32.158 Joy there interesting so when you allow  <br>01:09:35.279 yourself to deal with being  <br>01:09:36.279 uncomfortable in the moment it turns out  <br>01:09:39.839 you it removes the thing that was making  <br>01:09:41.520 you uncomfortable in the moment which is  <br>01:09:43.040 like the avoidance or the worry or  <br>01:09:45.759 overthinking whatever else yeah I I  <br>01:09:48.000 think we have this and it's fed by  <br>01:09:49.839 modern culture this kind of expectancy  <br>01:09:52.198 that really we should be happy all the  <br>01:09:54.440 time and if you know if we've arranged  <br>01:09:56.800 things appropriately for our lives and  <br>01:09:59.120 if we've done our work and you know  <br>01:10:01.760 aimed true then we should just be like  <br>01:10:04.400 life is great and I don't believe that  <br>01:10:07.600 anymore I think that you know I mean  <br>01:10:10.960 like Buddha said life is suffering but I  <br>01:10:13.880 really think that  <br>01:10:16.000 fundamentally like it's uncomfortable to  <br>01:10:19.040 be  <br>01:10:20.080 alive and that it's a kind of a constant  <br>01:10:22.719 state of restlessness and discomfort if  <br>01:10:25.000 we're being really honest and and tuning  <br>01:10:27.120 in when I really let myself see that and  <br>01:10:30.080 feel that all of a sudden I'm I'm freed  <br>01:10:34.280 from from some of  <br>01:10:38.400 that what has caused your anxiety  <br>01:10:40.640 throughout your life in the moment you  <br>01:10:42.400 you referenced earlier that some things  <br>01:10:43.719 have happened that have led you to  <br>01:10:46.040 understand this better and understand  <br>01:10:47.760 yourself better what is what am I  <br>01:10:49.520 missing from this jsaw puzzle yeah well  <br>01:10:51.560 you're you're good you could have been a  <br>01:10:53.199 psychiatrist oh really yeah it's always  <br>01:10:55.640 time this doesn't work out there's still  <br>01:10:57.880 time right it's not too late you get a  <br>01:10:59.360 new profession yay um I think you know  <br>01:11:01.719 for me the the big Turning Point um was  <br>01:11:05.280 that we lost our we lost a child and um  <br>01:11:10.120 in the immediate aftermath of our  <br>01:11:12.000 child's death I was just determined to  <br>01:11:16.199 like sort of undo the experience  <br>01:11:19.560 and um you know get enough Psychotherapy  <br>01:11:24.960 and enough whatever whatever it took to  <br>01:11:28.679 sort of not feel that pain and it wasn't  <br>01:11:31.440 until I really just said oh like I'm  <br>01:11:33.560 going to feel this pain for the rest of  <br>01:11:35.159 my life it's never going away that  <br>01:11:36.880 suddenly I felt some relief from that  <br>01:11:38.920 pain and that was a real window for  <br>01:11:42.040 me so interesting that the  <br>01:11:46.800 it's  <br>01:11:49.080 acceptance yeah and and you know and and  <br>01:11:52.000 I think you know one of the reasons I  <br>01:11:53.760 love treating patients with addiction is  <br>01:11:56.400 because I really relate to that hitting  <br>01:11:59.159 bottom moment you know that moment when  <br>01:12:01.719 it's like you just have the feeling that  <br>01:12:05.159 like everything I try to do to manage  <br>01:12:08.760 this Behavior or to make my life better  <br>01:12:10.800 only makes it worse I felt like I had a  <br>01:12:13.440 very similar  <br>01:12:14.840 experience um and that it was only when  <br>01:12:17.800 I kind of realized oh I yeah I I can't  <br>01:12:22.199 run from this I cannot run this pain uh  <br>01:12:25.000 that I I begin to have some the  <br>01:12:27.520 beginnings of relief from that  <br>01:12:29.920 experience I can't outrun this  <br>01:12:32.920 pain it's all natural sort of  <br>01:12:35.600 disposition to try and outrun pain isn't  <br>01:12:37.199 it that's the irony right we're really  <br>01:12:39.600 wired to outrun the pain we are like we  <br>01:12:42.480 reflexively seek out pleasure and avoid  <br>01:12:44.600 pain and yet that's the very thing thing  <br>01:12:46.920 that doesn't get us to where we want to  <br>01:12:48.880 go but we do now live in a world where  <br>01:12:52.040 it's very easy to outrun the pain yes  <br>01:12:54.800 this is a lion that's chasing me this  <br>01:12:56.679 could be a bad email and then I open up  <br>01:12:58.880 a tab and start Doom scrolling or open  <br>01:13:01.440 up a tab and start watching video  <br>01:13:03.400 playing video games or pornography or  <br>01:13:05.440 whatever yeah that's exactly right there  <br>01:13:07.960 are so many ways that we can now  <br>01:13:09.639 distract ourselves from you know our own  <br>01:13:12.239 suffering or our own  <br>01:13:14.080 awareness and where do you find yourself  <br>01:13:16.040 now with dealing with that grief and the  <br>01:13:18.400 pain as we sit here yeah I mean I I feel  <br>01:13:22.080 like in many ways it's been a real gift  <br>01:13:24.159 in my life you know it's really informed  <br>01:13:26.480 my life in in ways that um I mean I I've  <br>01:13:31.480 learned things from that experience that  <br>01:13:33.560 I think it would have been almost  <br>01:13:35.199 impossible for me to learn otherwise you  <br>01:13:38.040 deal with a lot of people that are in a  <br>01:13:40.480 state of  <br>01:13:42.040 suffering  <br>01:13:44.840 I imagine that's a  <br>01:13:47.040 weight because I um even hearing the  <br>01:13:50.000 story of the lady that passed away after  <br>01:13:51.840 that water addiction it was like a it  <br>01:13:53.360 was like a weight on my shoulders just  <br>01:13:54.560 to hear it  <br>01:13:55.639 so if your profession puts you right at  <br>01:13:58.120 the heart of this type of suffering how  <br>01:14:00.560 do  <br>01:14:01.880 you manage that to to hold that  <br>01:14:05.880 weight a couple things um first of all a  <br>01:14:09.080 lot of people get better and when people  <br>01:14:11.800 with addiction get better  <br>01:14:14.040 it's so much better that it's incredibly  <br>01:14:17.760 rewarding to see and they're amazing  <br>01:14:19.960 people Absolut like the most tenacious  <br>01:14:22.920 talented people you'll ever meet and  <br>01:14:25.239 when they get better it impacts so many  <br>01:14:28.320 other people right their friends their  <br>01:14:30.360 family the people they work with so it's  <br>01:14:33.280 very rewarding work and and not at all  <br>01:14:35.920 burdensome of course you know for  <br>01:14:38.120 patients who don't don't get better or  <br>01:14:41.040 patients who die it's a terrible feeling  <br>01:14:44.679 and there is a sense of um  <br>01:14:47.120 responsibility and and guilt even when I  <br>01:14:49.679 feel like there was nothing that I could  <br>01:14:51.080 have done otherwise um you know I carry  <br>01:14:53.880 those losses with me so it's hard is  <br>01:14:56.400 there any particular cases that have  <br>01:14:58.320 stayed with you the most I mean every  <br>01:15:00.920 patient I've had who's died while under  <br>01:15:03.639 my care those are incredibly painful um  <br>01:15:07.440 and I will never you know those are sort  <br>01:15:10.040 of a those people will be with me as a  <br>01:15:14.159 part of me for all of my life young and  <br>01:15:17.000 old yeah young and old yeah it's  <br>01:15:19.120 especially tragic to you to lose young  <br>01:15:21.560 people and it always feels like their  <br>01:15:24.520 second gu ing like oh if only I had done  <br>01:15:26.960 that or if only we had intervened here  <br>01:15:29.199 but I just think that's the nature of  <br>01:15:31.120 death we we can't get away from the  <br>01:15:33.239 feelings of guilt around it no matter  <br>01:15:35.239 who we are and no matter the  <br>01:15:37.280 circumstances how young can addiction  <br>01:15:40.800 and the consequences of  <br>01:15:42.560 addiction ruin someone's life like how  <br>01:15:44.920 young can someone be when their life is  <br>01:15:46.320 ruined from from the work you've done  <br>01:15:47.639 and the the patients you've worked with  <br>01:15:49.880 and what are those addictions typically  <br>01:15:51.600 that seem to be most um susceptible to  <br>01:15:54.400 those that are young  <br>01:15:56.800 well I mean you know some some kids  <br>01:15:59.800 start with drugs and alcohol you know  <br>01:16:03.199 five six seven eight five six yeah I  <br>01:16:06.199 mean it's you know some some some kids  <br>01:16:08.280 use with their parents or their  <br>01:16:09.920 caregivers they're exposed very early if  <br>01:16:13.199 we seriously conceptualize digital media  <br>01:16:16.239 as a drug I mean then we've got you know  <br>01:16:18.639 even younger cohorts starting with that  <br>01:16:20.800 and we do know that kids can get  <br>01:16:23.679 addicted to digital media  <br>01:16:25.840 and as a result um die from that I mean  <br>01:16:29.000 there was just this tragic case of a  <br>01:16:31.560 young man who essentially got addicted  <br>01:16:34.239 to a chat box I think he was 14 not my  <br>01:16:37.000 patient it was written up um in the New  <br>01:16:39.199 York Times in the Wall Street Journal  <br>01:16:41.560 and he fell in love with this chat box  <br>01:16:43.280 started to isolate wasn't spending time  <br>01:16:45.199 with his family or friends and then  <br>01:16:47.560 eventually took his own life purportedly  <br>01:16:50.000 so he could join this imaginary person  <br>01:16:55.880 what's the youngest patient you've ever  <br>01:16:57.239 seen the youngest I've seen is probably  <br>01:16:59.960 around 15 14 15 and they had an  <br>01:17:02.880 addiction yeah usually cannabis alcohol  <br>01:17:06.239 nicotine can you get addicted to  <br>01:17:07.960 cannabis oh yeah oh my gosh cannabis is  <br>01:17:12.080 very addictive really oh yeah  <br>01:17:15.880 yeah harmful very harmful the target  <br>01:17:19.639 organ that it damages the most is the  <br>01:17:22.040 brain um it's harmful in many ways I  <br>01:17:25.120 mean it number one it demotivates people  <br>01:17:29.480 often and so they can have the feeling  <br>01:17:32.679 that they're getting stuff done or that  <br>01:17:34.480 they're creative when in fact they're  <br>01:17:35.840 not doing  <br>01:17:37.400 anything um it most people smoke it and  <br>01:17:41.040 so it can be damaging to the lungs and  <br>01:17:43.199 and other other organs um a lot of  <br>01:17:46.199 people say that well cannabis isn't  <br>01:17:47.840 addictive because I don't have this  <br>01:17:49.920 standard withdrawal phenomenon when I  <br>01:17:51.719 stop like I don't have the shakes or  <br>01:17:53.360 anything like that but keep in mind the  <br>01:17:55.520 universal symptoms of addiction are  <br>01:17:57.760 psychological symptoms anxiety  <br>01:17:59.600 irritability depression insomnia craving  <br>01:18:02.520 and people have that in Spades when they  <br>01:18:04.440 try to stop using cannabis plus we often  <br>01:18:07.000 see something called the hyperemesis  <br>01:18:09.280 syndrome so cannabis can help with  <br>01:18:12.120 nausea and vomiting it can help decrease  <br>01:18:14.760 the feeling of wanting to vomit but  <br>01:18:18.239 again as the brain continues to be  <br>01:18:20.800 exposed to it there's this process of  <br>01:18:22.880 neuro adaptation it stops working and it  <br>01:18:25.440 can even turn on them and do the  <br>01:18:27.239 opposite So eventually people can  <br>01:18:29.440 actually have a cyclical vomiting  <br>01:18:31.480 syndrome as a result of cannabis so  <br>01:18:34.560 they'll show up in the emergency room  <br>01:18:35.639 and say I can't stop I can't stop  <br>01:18:37.199 vomiting and the reason is because of  <br>01:18:39.520 the Cannabis that they maybe initially  <br>01:18:41.600 started uh to stop feelings of  <br>01:18:45.440 nausea on page 40 of dopamine Nation you  <br>01:18:48.880 say we've lost the ability to tolerate  <br>01:18:50.719 even minor forms of discomfort yeah and  <br>01:18:52.800 as I was reading through this section of  <br>01:18:54.040 your book I was thinking it sounds like  <br>01:18:56.440 we've gone a little bit soft in society  <br>01:18:59.760 um we've reset our pleasure pain  <br>01:19:02.560 threshold to the side of pain that even  <br>01:19:04.800 the slightest thing feels like trauma to  <br>01:19:06.679 us even things that objectively speaking  <br>01:19:08.679 a generation or two ago would not have  <br>01:19:10.679 been considered traumatic are now trauma  <br>01:19:13.120 we live in a bit of a trauma Society uh  <br>01:19:15.280 one that doesn't appear to be very  <br>01:19:16.520 resilient and the only measure of that  <br>01:19:17.920 that I have is if I think about the work  <br>01:19:19.440 that my grandfather had to do versus the  <br>01:19:21.719 work that you know people maybe in my  <br>01:19:23.88|## SUMMARY  <br>Dr. Anna Lembke discusses addiction, dopamine's role in pleasure and pain, and strategies for achieving balance.  <br>  <br>## IDEAS:  <br>- Dopamine is essential for survival, motivating us to seek out rewards and pleasures.  <br>- The brain's pleasure and pain centers are interconnected, influencing addiction behaviors and choices.  <br>- Modern technology can hijack our reward systems, leading to increased vulnerability to addiction.  <br>- People often misidentify their discomfort and rationalize addictive behaviors as beneficial or necessary.  <br>- Exercise can boost dopamine levels without the typical addictive consequences associated with drugs.  <br>- Addiction often manifests in seemingly innocuous behaviors, such as compulsive reading or excessive work.  <br>- A significant portion of society engages in compulsive overconsumption, often without recognizing it as a problem.  <br>- The relationship between pain and pleasure is complex, with both being relative to one another.  <br>- Early exposure to addictive substances can lead to lifelong challenges with addiction.  <br>- Individuals may struggle to recognize the harm of their behaviors while actively engaging in them.  <br>- Substances like cannabis can be addictive and harmful, often leading to psychological issues.  <br>- Withdrawal symptoms from addiction can manifest as anxiety, irritability, and insomnia.  <br>- The pursuit of pleasure often overshadows the necessary discomfort that fosters growth and resilience.  <br>- Being present with discomfort can ultimately lead to greater emotional regulation and fulfillment.  <br>- Addiction is not limited to substances; behaviors can also become addictive and damaging.  <br>- The rise of technology has created new forms of addiction, particularly among younger generations.  <br>  <br>## INSIGHTS:  <br>- Recognizing the interplay between pleasure and pain is crucial for understanding addiction dynamics.  <br>- Acknowledging discomfort can provide a pathway to greater emotional resilience and awareness.  <br>- We must actively seek out challenges that encourage growth rather than succumb to avoidance.  <br>- Many addictive behaviors arise from the need to escape discomfort or seek immediate gratification.  <br>- The modern world often promotes instant pleasures, which can lead to chronic dissatisfaction.  <br>- Self-awareness is vital for identifying harmful behaviors masquerading as harmless activities.  <br>- Finding balance in today's pleasure-rich environment requires intentional effort and mindfulness.  <br>- Awareness of personal triggers can help mitigate the risk of falling into addictive patterns.  <br>- Understanding that addiction can stem from various sources, not just trauma, broadens our perspective.  <br>- Acknowledging the societal pressures and norms around productivity can help combat work addiction.  <br>  <br>## QUOTES:  <br>- "Dopamine is fundamental to our survival."  <br>- "The same parts of the brain that process pleasure also process pain."  <br>- "We automatically seek out pleasure and avoid pain."  <br>- "Alcohol works through its own chemical pathway."  <br>- "We're all wired to be addicted."  <br>- "One hit of a meth pipe is equal to 10 orgasms."  <br>- "We've lost the ability to tolerate even minor forms of discomfort."  <br>- "Digital media lights up the same reward pathway as drugs and alcohol."  <br>- "People can get addicted to behaviors too."  <br>- "The brain adapts by down regulating dopamine transmission."  <br>- "Every time we do something pleasurable, dopamine affects our behavior."  <br>- "The balance wants to remain level."  <br>- "It’s okay to be unhappy or restless."  <br>- "Addiction is the continued compulsive use of a substance despite harm."  <br>- "If we continue to consume our drug of choice, we enter an addicted brain."  <br>- "Exercise can help restore homeostasis and positively affect dopamine levels."  <br>  <br>## HABITS:  <br>- Engage in physical activities like exercise to boost dopamine naturally and combat cravings.  <br>- Practice mindfulness to remain present, reducing the urge to escape discomfort.  <br>- Limit exposure to digital media to help reset your reward system and reduce addiction risk.  <br>- Set boundaries around work to prevent excessive consumption and burnout.  <br>- Implement a regular sleep schedule to maintain emotional regulation and mental clarity.  <br>- Explore hobbies that require effort and investment, promoting satisfaction over instant gratification.  <br>- Take periodic breaks from addictive behaviors to assess their impact on your well-being.  <br>- Engage in social activities that foster genuine connections, counteracting feelings of loneliness.  <br>- Maintain a balanced diet to support overall brain health and dopamine production.  <br>- Reflect on personal triggers and develop strategies to mitigate their impact on behaviors.  <br>  <br>## FACTS:  <br>- Dopamine release is significantly increased by addictive substances compared to natural rewards.  <br>- The average life of a business has decreased from 50 years to around 15 years.  <br>- Participation in ultramarathons increased by 1,676% between 1996 to 2008.  <br>- Cannabis can lead to psychological symptoms similar to those of other addictive substances.  <br>- The human brain can experience a dopamine deficit state even after stopping substance use.  <br>- Withdrawal from addictive substances can cause universal symptoms like anxiety and depression.  <br>- Digital media can be as addictive as traditional substances, affecting younger generations particularly.  <br>- Many people are unaware of their compulsive overconsumption behaviors and their consequences.  <br>- The relationship between pleasure and pain is fundamental to understanding addiction in modern life.  <br>- Addictive behaviors can stem from a variety of sources, not just childhood trauma.  <br>  <br>## REFERENCES:

Lembke.  <br>- Various studies on addiction, dopamine, and neuroscience discussed in the podcast.  <br>  <br>## ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY  <br>Understanding the complex relationship between dopamine, pleasure, and pain is essential for overcoming addiction.  <br>  <br>## RECOMMENDATIONS:  <br>- Practice self-awareness to identify rationalizations for harmful behaviors and address them.  <br>- Engage in activities that require effort to foster genuine satisfaction and reduce reliance on instant gratification.  <br>- Develop a support network to help navigate challenges and reduce feelings of isolation.  <br>- Reflect regularly on your behaviors and their impact on your mental health and well-being.  <br>- Explore new hobbies or interests that challenge you and promote personal growth.  <br>- Limit time spent on social media to reduce compulsive scrolling and dopamine-seeking behaviors.  <br>- Seek professional help if struggling with addiction to gain tools and strategies for recovery.  <br>- Embrace discomfort as a natural part of life, allowing for greater emotional resilience.  <br>- Set realistic goals around reducing addictive behaviors and celebrate small victories along the way.  <br>- Prioritize sleep and regular exercise to support overall mental health and well-being.|**Description:** This video features Dr. Anna Lembke, a psychiatrist and addiction expert,

what I know about this disorder what's causing**0:05**it and what we're not doing to prevent it or treated it it will be recognized as the greatest tragedy in the history**0:10**of medicine Thomas CA freed is a professor of biology genetics and biochemistry who has dedicated the past**0:16**30 years Gathering scientific evidence on what could be the true origin and prevention of cancer cancer is getting**0:22**worse and there's no major advance in reducing death rates and I can speak to the reasons for that all major cancer**0:29**research PL think cancer is a genetic disease you believe otherwise it's not whether you believe it's what the data**0:34**tell us and the evidence is massive to support that cancer is a metabolic disorder and the problem is we're doing**0:40**everything we possibly can in our lifestyle to induce it the scientific evidence is there like for example we**0:46**know that cancer was extremely rare in African tribes that were living according to the traditional ways but**0:52**when modern lifestyle entered into their societies cancer out of control we even did a study on THS we know that wolves**0:58**in the wild don't die from cancer but cancer is the number one killer of domestic dogs why it's because of our**1:05**lifestyle issues and a lot of us are doing things without the knowledge that it would put us at risk but with**1:10**metabolic therapy you can use it as both a prevention and a treatment and we're seeing more and more of terminal cancer**1:15**patients outliving their predictabilities because of this and let me tell you one thing and remember it if you do metabolic therapy you can**1:22**actually reduce risk for cancer you can take away the fear and when you say metabolic therapy tell me what those**1:27**things are number one before this episode starts I have a**1:32**small favor to ask from you two months ago 74% of people that watched this channel didn't subscribe we're now down**1:38**to 69% my goal is 50% so if you've ever**1:44**liked any of the videos we've posted if you like this channel can you do me a quick favor and hit the Subscribe button it helps this channel more than you know**1:50**and the bigger the channel gets as you've seen the bigger the guests get thank you and enjoy this**1:58**episode Professor C if someone walks up to you on the street and they're you know they know nothing  <br>**What Would Dr Seyfried Say He Does?2:03**about science and they know nothing about medicine Etc and they asked you what do you do and why do you do it how would you respond I'm a professor of**2:10**biology at Boston College so uh in that role I spent a lot of my time working**2:16**with undergraduates and graduate students in training them to be scientific literate in in various**2:23**aspects of biology the research program that we have at the University is also**2:29**Focus fed on understanding uh how to manage cancer better how it originates**2:35**and how to prevent it how much of a problem is cancer globally what are the  <br>**How Much Of A Problem Is Cancer Globally?2:40**sort of headline statistics on the macro view of cancer for someone that really doesn't know yeah well it's getting**2:46**worse uh I can't say there it's in the millions I I I know precisely what's**2:52**going on in this country because the American Cancer Society uh every year uh**2:57**distributes the data on on cancer um we have almost two million new cases**3:04**diagnosed per year in the United States and we have 1,700 people a day**3:10**dying from cancer in in the United States which comes to about 70 people**3:15**per hour in the United States now when I went to China I looked at some numbers**3:22**there and it was 8,000 people a day are dying from cancer obviously the population is so much**3:28**larger and uh I don't know what it is in the UK I mean we'd have to go to their cancer**3:34**Registries but but what we do know is that it's supposed to be a lot worse by**3:39**2050 than it is today so there seems to be no reduction in death suffering for**3:45**this disease and I I can speak to the the reasons for that but right now I**3:51**would say it's a global uh epidemic of cancer it's not it's not getting better it's getting worse more people are dying**3:57**from it there's no major advance in in reducing death rates so it's a great**4:03**tragedy so um and when we when we understand what's causing it and what**4:08**we're not doing to prevent it or treat it it'll it'll be recognized as the singular greatest tragedy in the history**4:14**of of medicine worldwide when it when when they come to know what I know about this disorder and then they realize what**4:21**we've been doing in in in in in a misdirected way it will be recognized as**4:26**the greatest tragedy in the history of medicine what Tye types of cancer are people dying from what is the most  <br>**What Types Of Cancer Are People Dying From?4:32**popular types of cancer for men and women well it's always been lung cancer pretty much for men and women uh lung**4:38**cancer has always been the number one but but we have pancreatic breast cancer colon cancer these are all on the rise**4:45**colon cancer is on the rise pancreatic cancer is on the rise in this country I I I I can't speak for other countries**4:52**they may dare very slightly due to diet lifestyle issues but lung cancer has always been recognized as as the number**5:00**one cancer how many people in the United States then based on the statistics would develop cancer well it seems to  <br>**How Many People Will Develop Cancer?5:07**increase every year so it's kind of a moving Target it doesn't seem to go down**5:13**you know what it is today I don't know but what I do know is the numbers of people that are dying each day because**5:19**the um American Cancer Society comes out with I think it's 612,000**5:25**people uh will die this year 2024 uh from cancer**5:30**in this year so divide it by 365 and it comes out to just about 1,700 people a**5:36**day divide that number by 24 and you get about 70 people an hour based on the**5:41**numbers provided to us from the American Cancer Society when they say we've made**5:47**major advances in man in cancer incidences right so in the 1990s they**5:53**instituted the uh anti-smoking campaigns all right so today if you read they say**5:59**we have reduced cancer deaths by 30 31 or 32% wow that sounds really impressive**6:06**so what they do is they take the number this is what the national the American Cancer Society has done and published in**6:12**their papers okay if we didn't stop smoking in the 90s and everybody**6:18**continued to smoke the trajectory would be very very high because we stopped**6:23**smoking or this it's we have 33% lower death than if we didn't stop smoking but**6:30**the trajectory is continuing to increase maybe not as steep as it would have been had we continued to smoke so it's it was**6:36**clearly a prevention it had nothing to do with a a treatment it had to do with prevention that was giving the the the**6:43**oh we've made major advances in in reducing cancer death rate yeah because people sto smoking for the mo for many**6:49**many people more people would have died had they not smoked so we have um people**6:55**that are not not real people we're just looking at what would have happened if if we didn't stop smoking what are the  <br>**Where Does Cancer Rank In The Probabilities Of Taking My Life?7:02**leading causes of death worldwide in terms of diseases is is I I hear that**7:07**heart disease is number one I think that's heart disease is number one uh cancer is number two okay and there are**7:15**many different types of cancer right there's hundreds of different forms of cancer if you look under the electron**7:21**microscope or a correction even a light micro this is how most cancers are diagnosed by by light**7:27**microscopy uh you look under the microscope and you see a bunch of cells that are dysmorphic in the way they look**7:33**and then they all have genetic defects and all this kind of stuff but they all have one thing in common they depend on**7:39**a on a fermentation energy without oxygen so all cancers are a singular type of disease it's just that they**7:46**happen in different tissues but when you look at the underlying problem they're all very very similar they can't live uh**7:51**without a fermentation which means energy without oxygen so that's the common pathophysiological problem in all**7:58**cancers whether it's a colon brain breast bladder skin uh lung we we've**8:04**looked at all these cancers and they're all they're all essentially using the same mechanism to to grow out of control**8:11**so what is that F fermentation you mentioned fermentation is energy without oxy what does that mean uh we breathe  <br>**What Is The Fermentation Process?8:17**air and we uh exhale CO2 and water vapor and those are the waste products of the food that we eat we break everything is**8:24**broken down and combusted in our mitochondria of the cell and the waste products are Co 2 and water Vapors those**8:31**are the waste products but if you and I were to stop breathing for any**8:36**particular time period uh uh our bodies would fill up with uh lactic acid and**8:42**succinic acid like if we were to have a heart attack or when somebody has a heart attack um they don't die instantly**8:49**uh if if they if they're there without for five or seven minutes without oxygen they they may die because the brain dies**8:55**but if you can get the heart to beat again and get oxygen back in the system you can come alive again but when we**9:01**have that massive Interruption of oxygen into our body um the cells fall back on**9:08**an ancient they up they immediately turn on these ancient Pathways to get energy**9:14**without oxygen for a short period of time and that's the sugar glucose which**9:19**is already in our bloodstream from the food we eat and the amino acid glutamine which is a high amino acid in our**9:26**bloodstreams highest level of amino acid is the glutamine these two fuels are now**9:32**burned for energy obtain energy without oxygen there's no there's a these**9:37**Pathways upregulate and you can get ATP which is energy to keep you alive for a short period of time but your**9:43**bloodstream is filling up with the waste products called lactic acid and succinic acid lactic acid is coming from glucose**9:51**to sugar and succinic acid is coming from the amino acid glutamine and they build up and that tells you you're**9:57**fermenting you're getting energy without oxygen because you're not breathing very simple you're not breathing but I'm Not**10:02**Dead Yet now of course if you don't get it for very long you die it's just that**10:07**now the other way you can stop uh oxygenation in our bodies quickly is**10:13**with the poison cyanide so if we God forbid we were to take cyanide we'd be**10:18**both dead within within a minute we just just because our bodies are completely shut down of energy from oxygen now**10:26**here's the cancer cell the cancer cell lives in in can live in in cyanide**10:32**cyanide does not kill a tumor okay War a warberg showed this a long time ago and we've also shown the same thing in our**10:39**lab others have shown this the interesting thing is when you look at cancer cells even in the presence of**10:44**oxygen even in oxygen they're throwing out lactic acid and succinic acid what**10:49**does that mean that means the en the organ organel inside the cell that**10:55**generates energy is not efficient it's inefficient and the cells are using**11:00**ancient fermentation and when I say ancient fermentation you have to realize the Earth is 4 and a half billion years**11:06**old um the organisms that existed on our planet uh two and a half billion years**11:12**ago were all fermenters there was no oxygen in the atmosphere till the photosynthetic bacteria started making**11:18**oxygen they were living cells they had no oxygen and they were growing like**11:23**crazy unregulated growth just unreg what's going on here and they would die**11:28**as soon as the mble fuels were dissipated as they gobbled up everything they would just die so they lived as**11:34**long as they could reproduce and have fermentation fuels the cancer cell in our body is doing nothing than falling**11:40**back on these ancient fermentation Pathways that become accelerated up regulated in the tumor cell because the**11:48**efficiency of the energy coming from the mitochondria is now uh depleted it's**11:53**defective in many different ways so this is very clear and this happens in lung cancer colon canc we've looked at all**12:00**the major Cancers and we found out these common defects are seen in all the cancers so they're all very similar in**12:06**their metabolism they're very different in what they look like under the microscope lung doesn't look like colon doesn't look like brain um they're very**12:13**different genetically they're all different from each other but they're all common in a in a dependency on this  <br>**How Have You Arrived At This Conclusion?12:19**ancient pathway of energy metabolism can you take me back you mentioned a guy called Walberg there yeah can you take**12:26**me back on the journey that the scientific community or at least you have been on to arrive at the conclusion**12:31**that the central sort of causal Factor at least an indication of a causal factor of cancer lies in this shift in**12:38**Energy Systems where did this understanding start in in research well it started with Oto warberg for sure uh**12:44**in the 1920s uh the other linkage before I tell you what OT warberg did because I**12:50**was like everybody else I thought cancer was a genetic disease and and I heard about warberg didn't really know what**12:56**what he was talking about or invested any time thinking about what he said but**13:01**Linda nebling was a PhD nursing student at Case Western Reserve University and**13:07**in Ohio and she took these two little hopeless kids brain cancer we call**13:12**hopeless cases when they have no um predictability of long-term survival and**13:18**she gave them a ketogenic diet to lower blood sugar and she was able to rescue**13:24**these kids one one one eventually died the other one was lost to followup and she said it her strategy was based on**13:30**what OT warberg had said about glucose and cancer so then I said warberg I said who the hell what let me go back and**13:37**check out who this guy was and what he did because I was seeing similar things in the in the mouse with that drug it**13:42**was lowering glucose and and we were sh shrinking these tumor cells and we published a paper uh the first one of**13:49**the first ever papers linking that how high your blood sugar is determines how fast your tumor will grow in the mice**13:55**and now how this been replicated in all human cancers the higher your blood sugar the faster the tumor grows the**14:01**lower the blood sugar the slower the tumor grows undeniable for all different human Mouse cancers wow so warberg had**14:09**said this a long time ago back in the 1920s he he was taking slices of all**14:14**kinds of human and rat mouse tumors and slicing them up and he noticed something really strange about these um cancers**14:22**they take in less oxygen compared to the normal tissue from which they came wow**14:27**so they're kind of like oxygen deprived and they were throwing out this lactic acid waste product that he was that he**14:33**was saying and they were taking in so much more glucose than the normal so the normal cells take in just a little bit**14:39**of glucose and they can make tremendous energy from a tiny amount this guy was taking in huge amounts of glucose but**14:45**not fully metabolizing it to CO2 and water but dumping it out as lactic acid**14:51**which is a a breakdown product of glucose that is not fully metabolized in the cell wow he said this is**14:58**unbelievable and then he did all kinds of tissue I looked at his data was unbelievable he was cutting humans mice**15:04**rats and seeing the same thing over and over again and uh he was saying the**15:09**origin of cancer has to do with something in the ability of the mitochondrian the organel to generate**15:16**efficient energy from oxygen so the sorry the mitochondria is the part of the cell that creates energy it's the**15:22**part of the cell that creates energy through oxidative phosphorilation which is burning energy using oxygen okay okay**15:30**so it's like an engine it's an engine a very highly efficient engine that this is an organel you have to realize we**15:37**have the cell yeah and we have a nucleus that every everybody knows about this nucleus and then we have all these**15:42**little organel in there we have lomes and we have the mitochondrian which is like a spaghetti Network inside the cell**15:50**they fuse it's actually a second living it's a second living organism inside our cells and to simplify what they do the**15:57**mitochondria they convert oxygen and glucose into energy yes and they combust**16:02**uh energy uh they they take the foods that we eat have carbon hydrogen bonds**16:07**okay and we break those down inside our mitochondria and we and we and we when we break those bonds down we create a a**16:14**hydrogen gradient and we dissipate that gradient through an impeller mechanism that generates energy like crazy it's**16:21**unbelievable very efficient highly efficient but the cancer cell has corruption in that system but it doesn't**16:27**happen overnight as warberg said if you break that system too acutely and too fast the cell will die it doesn't have**16:34**the so you have to have two things to get from oxidative phosphorilation to uh**16:40**energy with with with minimal oxygen fermentation sorry just to keep it simple from a normal cell to a cancer**16:46**cell from a normal cell to a cancer cell doesn't happen overnight okay it's a chronic damage to the ability of of that  <br>**Why Do Cancers Grow So Rapidly?16:53**organel inside the cell to generate efficient energy okay so all we have to**16:59**know with cancer is that they're how are they growing so rapidly why are they going out of control how come it's so**17:04**hard to kill them because as long as you have those fermentable fuels that drive**17:10**this ancient fermentation pathway um they will continue to grow they're very hard to kill and the fermenting fuels**17:17**are glucose and and glutamine glutamine yeah okay so here let's let me tell you**17:22**in a nut are are you ready brace yourself are you ready I'm ready are you braced are you braced sufficiently bra**17:28**sufficient he's sufficiently braced okay so uh a solution to the cancer problem**17:35**to manage cancer without toxicity is to simultaneously restrict the two fuels**17:42**that are needed to drive this disregulated growth while transitioning the whole body off to a fuel that the**17:49**tumor cells can't use which is fatty acids and Ketone bodies so when we take**17:55**the cancer patients or the mice we put them into a calorie restriction lowering**18:00**the blood sugar uh that I said is one half of the two fuels you can lower that down really really low and then we use**18:08**specific drugs to Target the glutamine and together we can selectively restrict**18:14**the two fuels while we transition the whole body over to to ketones we as a**18:20**species evolved to be in nutritional ketosis for the the majority of our existence as a as a species like one and**18:26**a half million years for for centuries and centuries thousands and thousands of years our species you and me our**18:34**ancestors were always in a state of nutritional ketosis because there was very few carbohydrates in the**18:40**environment for them to be consuming right so the cancer cell the body you and I could if we stopped eating and we**18:46**took a low carbohydrate diet and just did water only fasting we would get into nutritional ketosis where the normal**18:53**cells our brain our kidneys our heart can be burning these Ketone bodies**18:58**because they have a good mitochondria and they can burn these fuels effectively the tumor cells have a bad mitochondria they can't burn those fuels**19:05**they're dependent on glucose and glutamine we can replace glucose and glutamine with Ketone bodies in the normal cells of our so we selectively**19:12**marginalize these tumor cells slowly over time uh we they slowly start to Die  <br>**What Are Ketones?19:18**the blood vessels disappear and the body comes in and dissolves them so for someone that has never heard the term**19:24**keto before ketosis or ketones in a simple way what are KET ketones ketones**19:31**are water soluble breakdown products of fatty acids okay they're beta hydroxy beate acetoacetate these are small**19:38**molecules that are water soluble the liver throws them out like crazy kidney a little bit but mostly liver so as I**19:45**told you earlier when we don't eat um you you get anxious mainly because**19:52**our brains are addicted to glucose it's like cocaine and nicotine and whatever**19:57**you start getting all antsy haven't eaten anything you know uh what's going on um so you then once the body realizes**20:04**you ain't going to eat anything we have to start mobilizing out of our fat resources and the fats uh go into the**20:10**bloodstream as triglycerides which are three fatty acids attached to a glycerol**20:16**backbone they go to the liver the liver chops them up and puts out these little water soluble Ketone bodies that the**20:24**name Ketone body is kind of a weird thing from biochemistry but but they're called Ketone bodies um and they can**20:31**supply the brain with energy the heart with energy and not only that they're a super fuel it's unbelievable that**20:38**mitochondria Burns these ketones okay but they ener remember I was talking about how energy efficient the**20:43**mitochondria become when they burn ketones they become even more energy efficient it's unbelievable how you you**20:49**they don't need as much oxygen to generate more en that's why they my colleagues called and some of the greats**20:56**in the bio in the biochemistry field called them super super fuel because you**21:01**can get more energy bang for buck burning a ketone body than you can burning a pyruvate coming from glucose**21:07**or even a fatty acid uh and the biochemistry for that is is interesting**21:12**but but the bottom line is when you transition away from these fuels to ke we don't forget we evolved our our**21:19**ancestors were always in a state of ketosis you get into that state by consuming very few carbohydrates and  <br>**What Can We Learn About Cancer From Our Ancestors?21:25**having a lot of energy and this is the way our ancestors were so what can we learn from our ancestors about cancer**21:31**how prevalent was cancer um when we look back at our ancestors if they were often in a state of ketosis yeah well um it's**21:39**hard to determine uh from skeletal records uh but I think we can look at U**21:45**um modern pop modern man who live according to their traditional ways um**21:52**you know uh Albert schwitzer the Great humanitarian physician went to Africa and looked at Africans that were living**21:58**according to the traditional ways and he said one of the weirdest things they don't have cancer it was like what what**22:04**uh cancer was extremely rare in Africans in ints living in in the in the areas**22:12**British when they came you know in in in looking at the health conditions of folks that lived in the Arctic Circle**22:18**cancer was not there they had other things but they didn't have cancer um Aboriginal folks so it seems as though**22:25**uh our living we we can't go back 50,000 years ago because we don't have people**22:30**to examine but we have people to examine today and that was one of the things schwitzer and several other Physicians**22:36**from Europe would go to Africa and they would look at these some of these tribes that were traditional and they would say**22:42**whoa what's going on with these Africans how come they don't have but when modern diet lifestyle entered into their**22:48**societies cancer out of control what about what about our the primate cousins**22:54**yeah um there's never been a documented uh case a breast cancer in a female**23:00**chimpanzee uh and they're 98% similar to us in Gene and protein sequence uh you**23:05**know what's going on with that um monkeys uh they don't generally form cancer they're eating they're not eating**23:12**what we eat okay don't forget we did not evolve to eat pork pies and Dunkin**23:19**Donuts jelly fil donnuts and pizzas we did not our ancestors did not eat this right we were killing and eating Animals**23:26**As I said we ate everything that walked crawled flew or swam on this planet became part of our diet um we did not**23:33**have Donuts on every corner delicate essin on every corner our we evolved over this period of time just like our**23:40**primate ancestors uh the animals chimps and gorillas and things that you see in**23:46**the zoos are fed their natural diets as if they were living in in their habitat**23:51**their natural habitat whether it was in South America Africa or wherever it was were're not throwing in jelly donuts**23:57**every day and pizza pie into the chimpanzee pen and as a matter of fact I even went to the zoo down down here in**24:04**in Boston Franklin Park Zoo and also at the San Diego Zoo I said how come how**24:10**come you guys don't give these guys run down and get a big pizza for these for these animals oh no it' be animal**24:16**cruelty their systems aren't Geared for this well neither are**24:22**we we have an obesity epidemic we have all these different chronic diseases why**24:27**we didn't have to eat all this crap that we're eating today so what I've told many people in these podcasts is that**24:33**our food science and technology and our society's technology has evolved so much  <br>**What Role Does Exercise Play In Fighting These Diseases?24:39**faster than our biology can you explain to me in simple terms the role the exercises playing in staving of cancer**24:46**well exercise lowers blood sugar you know you and and also lowers glutamine so uh the two fuels that are driving uh**24:53**now we can't completely remove glutamine by exercise that's for sure um but we my**24:58**my late good friend George kahill published some papers on showing how exercise could actually lower uh**25:04**glutamine availability so it's a it's a little bit of a push but you're also when you exercise you're burning and**25:10**you're not eating a lot of carbs your mitochondria burning ketones and the oxygenation from all the exercise is**25:16**keeping those mitochondria super healthy at their highest level of Energy Efficiency so exercise you're building**25:23**muscle as well aren't you yeah you're building well you can build muscle but you're certainly getting aerobic exercise to oxygen is coming in and**25:30**you're burning ketones which I already told you is a super fuel so your body is super healthy uh these bodies from the**25:37**Paleolithic period these men were jacked there was no obesity in these people they had tremendous energy they're**25:43**they're not dying from uh the things that are killing us they're dying from injuries and infections when you  <br>**What Lifestyle Choices Are Causing The Cancer To Develop?25:49**described this slow and gradual shift in the cell as it moves to this sort of**25:55**ancient system it sounded very gradual so in my I thought okay so does that mean that the cancer is a gradual**26:03**process that is kind of building up in me or isn't building up in Me based on the lifestyle decisions I'm making and**26:09**my environmental factors right now like I'm trying to say does is does**26:15**cancer start slowly years before you you you know you find it is a gradual process but it can**26:22**be impacted by several provocative Agents from the from the micro environment um lack of exercise okay so**26:30**we're not exercising nearly as much as our Paleolithic ancestors Bar None right**26:35**we have massive amounts of processed carbs in our diets we have a lot of emotional stress uh um mental emotional**26:44**stress that's impacting negatively on on our biology um we we have lack of sleep**26:52**sleep uh a lot of us because we we have stresses you you have to have when you put all of these impact act ful things**26:58**together in one person you can put yourself at risk for Cancer all of which**27:04**will damage and reduce the efficiency of mitochondria and also the joy of living**27:11**uh having friends and friendships and and this kind of thing reduces stress in a lot of different ways makes people**27:17**enjoy getting up and and having a a nice day rather than being depressed or or these kinds of things um you put all all**27:24**this together and you put yourself in a a diet and lifestyle that puts you at risk for damage to oxidative**27:31**phosphorilation and the transition from one form of energy to a fermentation energy and what I'm trying to understand**27:36**is that a it's a grad a gradual transition you have to be able to do that and how long does it take for a**27:43**colon a group of cells in a in a in a crypt of your colon to transition from**27:48**one stage to another you have to be constantly under stress those cells and that organ now why somebody gets colon**27:55**cancer another person gets breast cancer another person gets black cancer and some person gets a brain cancer and all these different kinds of cancers what**28:01**whatever happened the process was dis was causing a gradual disruption of**28:07**oxidative phosphorilation oxidative respiration and a and a gradual transition to a fermentation like in the**28:14**brain the neurons rarely if ever get cancer but the gal cells that support neurons they are usually the source of**28:21**the origin of cancer in the brain for those kinds of cells and you can look at different cells and some are more or**28:27**less prone and why this guy got lung cancer from from smoking cigarettes this guy got bladder cancer from smoking**28:33**cigarettes how did it all start it all started from a population of cells in one of those organs having an a chronic**28:41**not instant a chronic Interruption of oxidative energy followed by an upregulation of this fermentation energy**28:48**so really we need to be thinking about all the things that have caused dysfunction in the mitochondria absolutely I want to get a list of the**28:54**key things that are associated with causing this dysfunction okay carcinogens okay so carcinogens and you**29:00**know there's many asbesto there's all kinds of chemicals in the environment you hear about this oh there's a whole**29:05**list of carcinogens we and they put them on the on the labels on different chemicals they say carcinogenic  <br>**Is Cancer Genetic?29:11**potential and whatever you have what are the types of things that are C cogenic that most people don't realize oh well**29:17**now we're talking about microplastics we're talking about um is that in part what causes breast cancer cuz I always**29:25**think about dooen with breast cancer and and the stuff that we're kind of lathering onto our arm yeah well the the**29:30**one that was was most interesting was the talcum powder one how does talcum powder would cause ovarian cancer okay**29:37**it's taken up into the urogenital tract and it forms a fosi in in a part of the**29:42**ovarian tissue what's a fosi a Locus like a collection of material a fosi is**29:49**a an area where say talum materials would be accumulating and that leads to a**29:56**inflammatory um area of the body and our immune**30:01**system comes in to see what's going on our immune system is a healing machine and they see something that's not not**30:08**normal normally they would clean it up but they throw grow cyto kindes and growth factors on there leading to**30:14**disregulated damage to mitochondria and disregulated it and then you get this tumor that starts so if I get a talcum**30:21**powed uh granule or whatever and it goes into my body my body then tries to**30:26**attack it to sort of out and in doing so it creates inflammation which leads to damage to mitochondria in a particular**30:32**group of cells near that fosi okay and this this is applicable to I guess a lot of different Nano particles and yeah and**30:39**microplastics are this now they're looking at this but then we have chemical carcinogens tetrahydrochloride there's all kinds of other things that**30:45**can actually damage arsenics and and these kinds of chemicals um urethane uh**30:52**anything that could chronically damage uh a mitochondrian forcing over time for**30:58**ing it to upregulate the fermentation energy without oxygen isn't this most things I'm trying to figure out what I**31:04**how to live my life yeah well that's what that that's why it was called the oncogenic Paradox but but you can you  <br>**How Do We Keep Our Mitochondria Healthy?31:09**can avoid that that's why I'm saying if you can keep your mitochondria healthy how exercise and reduce uh consumption**31:17**of Highly processed carbohydrates do I need to be avoiding these microplastics as well you you know the problem with**31:23**microplastics they're very ubiquitous we're not really sure uh we just now becoming aware of it nobody really knew**31:29**that before um look it up it's but it could it could cause U small fosi in**31:35**different populations of cells but you know it's very hard to really chronically damage mitochondria**31:41**mitochondria a tough organel the problem is we are chronically abuse it without realizing what we need to do to keep it**31:47**healthy so even if you are exposed to chemical carcinogens even if you are exposed to all these things but you're**31:53**keeping your body as healthy as you possibly can you could possibly delay or**31:58**even prevent the damage to the mitochondria even though you have the even though you are being exposed to**32:04**this so it's a it's actually in your hands um you can actually reduce**32:10**risk for cancer by knowing what keeps your mitochondria healthy vigorous**32:15**exercise uh fasting water only fasting um you know it's very hard some but**32:21**sometimes we when we were putting mice on calorie restriction it was hard to get them to get tumors their body was so**32:26**healthy this was shown Years Ago by by a couple of scientists in mice using mice**32:32**with that developed a lot of breast cancer if you put them on a calorie restricted diet the incidence was way**32:37**way down so cancer is very preventable it's a very preventable uh disorder it's  <br>**Is Cancer Genetic?32:42**just that we're doing everything we possibly can induce it in our diet lifestyle a lot of big institutions**32:49**believe that cancer is a genetic problem**32:54**um you believe otherwise the evidence is striking I mean to believe it's not**33:00**whether you believe it's what the data tell us okay so according to the somatic mutation theory of cancers mutations in**33:07**the nucleus lead to disregulated cell growth that's the sematic mutation theory in the mitochondrial metabolic**33:13**Theory it's a transition from oxidative phosphorilation to to a fermentation metabolism inside inside the cell um the**33:22**mutations are largely irrelevant what do you mean by that when the mitochondria become defective they throw out**33:29**Ros reactive oxygen species that are carcinogenic and mutogenic W what does**33:36**that mean causing mutations so a lot of the mutations that we see in the nucleus of the tumor cell that is the subject of**33:42**the sematic mutation Theory are Downstream effects of the dysfunction of the mitochondria so the mitochondria is**33:49**causing a downstream effect which are mutations which according to the sematic mutation Theory are the cause of the**33:54**disregulated cell growth let me tell you why that's absolutely untrue there's some cancer cells growing**34:00**out of control have no mutations and normally not discuss how can that be that's a a challenge to the theory if**34:07**the theory says that all cancers have mutations and you have some cancers that have no mutations and they're growing out of control that should say who bell**34:14**ring one uh then they the the sematic mutation uh people people who think this**34:20**said oh okay we have we have a problem here not all mutations are the ones that cause the disregulated only some and we**34:27**have a name for those some that's called driver mut okay now it's a nice term because some of those mutations are**34:32**called passengers they don't really do anything but the drivers are the ones that lead to the disregulated cell**34:37**growth so we should be focusing our attention on these driver mutations new evidence from the recent scientific**34:43**literature can you believe this they're taking tissue normal tissues from patients different organs and things**34:49**like this from not patients from normal people no cancer perfectly like yourself here we would take tissue from you and**34:55**say oh my Christ look at the you got driver mutation in your esophagus and your different parts of your body you**35:00**got driver but you don't have a tumor what's going on with that how you explain that these driver mutations are**35:05**causing disregulated cell growth when we have thousands of driver mutations that are there that are not causing**35:11**disregulated cell growth oh okay that's a another problem the biggest devastating information against the**35:18**somatic mutation theory is if you take the nucleus from a tumor cell cleanly take it out of the tumor cell and you**35:24**have another normal cell here you take the nor the nucleus out of the normal cell and you put the tumor cell into**35:30**that cytoplasm you get regulated growth no disregulated growth but if I have the normal cell and have a tumor cell take**35:37**the tumor nucleus out of there and take the normal nucleus and put it into the tumor cytoplasm which contains**35:43**mitochondri defective mitoch disregulated cell Dr this has been seen over and over and over again so just to**35:48**summarize that so if you take the tumor nucleus side of the cell and put it into a a normal healthy cell yes um**35:55**everything's fine everything is fine but if you take take healthy cell nucleus and put it into a tumor cell you still**36:00**have the same dis regulated cell growth tumor growth so which means that it's not the nucleus absolutely it's**36:06**something else it's something else and that's the mitochondria and I told you then you have cancer cells with no mutations and then you have driver**36:12**mutations and normal cells that never become cancer you put all those things together and you have to be uh a**36:19**hopeless ideologue to think that cancer is a genetic disease um it's a silent**36:26**assumption in the field that cancer is a genetic every textbook of biology cell biology and bio cancer is a genetic  <br>**Why Haven't Opinions Changed Based On Dr Seyfried's Evidence?36:31**disease why hasn't people's opinions changed despite the evidence that you**36:37**present it's a very difficult thing it goes back to um when you have one Theory**36:44**replacing another theory it's called Paradigm Paradigm shifts and in all in**36:49**history of science Paradigm shifts have been met with great great resistance uh the clear the clearest one was the**36:56**Kernan Revolution when uh for eight 1,800 years astronomers in**37:04**our early Astron astronomers thought the Earth was immovable in the center of the solar system for 1,000 this was Claudius**37:12**TMI Aristotle and the Bible and all these Earth is immovable and the Sun and**37:18**the Moon and the planets all revolve around the earth 1,800 years even**37:24**Cernic's uh was working with these mathematical formulations this kep was being constantly confused until he said**37:31**what happens if we put the sun in the center of the solar system and consider the Earth as simply another planet that**37:37**would revolve oh all of a sudden things started to make sense and gardano Bruno**37:44**uh a theologian was put to death for suggesting that cernus was right um**37:50**there was a tremendous resistance on the part of the Roman Catholic Church at that time and this is the same thing**37:56**that happened when when and um Lewis Pastor said the germs the germs rather than bad air are the cause of disease so**38:04**uh and when Darwin Wallace theory of evolution came it's not special creation it's it's natural selection that that**38:10**can explain this these were massive Paradigm changes in the history of Science and what we're seeing today is**38:17**the same thing the mitochondria is the center of the problem with cancer not the nucleus the mitochondria it's a**38:23**mitochondrial metabolic disease and once you realize that we're going to drop these death rates massively in a very a  <br>**If We Adopt This Mindset, What Will Happen To Cancer Statistics?38:31**number of years for sure so if we take two paths then if we realize that that the mitochondria is the center of the**38:37**dysfunction and ultimately disease in the cell yes if we go that down that path what impact do you think that will**38:43**have on the canc cancer statistics over the coming years it'll drop it massively**38:48**okay I'm not going to say we'll get rid of cancer completely uh but here's the thing we may never get rid of it but we**38:54**can learn to live with it and keep it at Bay if if we know how to if we know that it can't survive without these two fuels**39:00**and you can do a diet and lifestyle that can restrict the availability of those two fuels and keep your mitochondria as**39:06**healthy as you possibly can what if we don't go down that path what you think then you're going to be right one out of two people are going to be having cancer**39:13**that your statistics are going to be U AB absolutely correct is there anybody that you believe because you know when  <br>**Are The Current Cures Working?39:19**we talk about these subjects often we think of like big Farmer and the incentives and money and follow the money and you'll figure out why people**39:25**don't want change are is any of that sort of conspiratorial thinking correct in your view are they I**39:31**don't know if that's conspiracy I don't like conspiracy terms that's absurds I like what are the facts of what we're**39:38**looking at but do you see a resistance from Big farmer to entertain this point of view um what do you think what do you**39:45**think I mean do you think this is I mean you're making a lot of not you but but people in these in that those Industries**39:51**the hospital industry is making enormous amounts of money they're rewarding we get uh7 billion a year for cancer**39:58**research in the in the in in the National Cancer Institute awarding gr many many not all many grants to look at**40:05**for gene mutations and all this kind of stuff um and we have drugs that are extremely expensive based on a sematic**40:11**mutation theory of cancer that are basically not dropping the death rate as I said we got while we're talking here**40:17**we're g to have 140 people dead uh from cancer uh 1,700 people years getting**40:22**worse and worse um with as you said we're always running for raising money for cancer research uh where's all that**40:29**money going what are you doing with all that money no accountability and then when you look at the scientific advisory committee of all these societies that**40:36**you're running for they all think published papers on cancer as a genetic disease it's too hard for the field to**40:43**accept at this point um it's it's too traumatic at what I'm saying it's too**40:50**disruptive to a a massive industry uh at this time they will come to gradually**40:56**adjust to what I'm saying it's just a matter of time because we cannot continue this trajectory it's immoral**41:02**what we're doing to some of these people I read a St that said the global incidence of early onset cancer**41:07**increased by roughly 80% between 1990 yeah and 2019 that's in the bmj oncology**41:16**um early onset of cancer is basically patients under the age of 50 and and when I think about this you know growing up in the UK whenever there's a a fun**41:23**run a charity race a marathon whatever it might be cancer research get the money yeah and to hear that you know**41:29**there's been so much money invested in cancer research over the last couple of decades but there's been an increase of**41:34**80% in early onset cancer in the same period for me I'm like this research doesn't appear to be**41:41**do being very effective well as I said you got to find what people don't do is they never ask where's the research go**41:48**what kind of research what what are you doing what is the research it's the theory that drives the the impetus to do  <br>**The Current Technologies Used To Prevent Cancer41:54**research now a lot of great stuff has been done on you know keeping people alive that**41:59**suffer from cancers right because if you think about the probability of dying from a cancer I'm I'm assuming that has gone**42:06**down yeah uh to some extent it has you know we call there's two ways of looking it's called Uh progression free survival**42:12**and overall survival uh these are the terminologies that are used in the clinical world of cancer uh uh and they**42:19**represent the approval of drugs through the Food and Drug Administration if you have a drug that**42:25**improves a progression free survival uh progression free means it looks like**42:30**the drug is working on the tumor um because you know the tumor you can see it it gets bigger and bigger and more**42:36**lethal and more lethal and and if I see it not growing nearly as much uh I say**42:41**wow look at the it's it's slowing the what we call traditional progression okay it's called progression free**42:47**survival and then you have overall survival so you have two ways to approve**42:53**drugs mostly for cancer right how does it work on aggression free survival and**42:58**how does it work on overall survival well they stop looking at overall survival now somebody's going to bark**43:04**and say well you know bottom line is mostly progression free which means that the patients it looks like the tumor is**43:09**being effectively managed but they live only a couple of months longer than they would have if they didn't use this drug**43:16**so therefore it's approved and and and um that as opposed to overall survival**43:22**you know you're only living a two okay You' lived two and a half extra months the tumor looked like it was manage**43:27**pretty well but your overall survival is is this much but you you didn't see the tumor growing uh we're going to improve**43:34**that drug so a lot of the new drugs that we're giving do a really good job at progression free survival but they do a**43:40**horrible job in keeping people alive much longer which ultimately is what you want to do you want overall survival let**43:46**me give you an example avastin uh bismid this this is an immoral drug that should never be used on people it was blocked**43:53**because it caused colon perforations in women with breast cancer they still use it on brain cancer and when you so the**44:00**in the tumor you got a A tumor you can see it with PET Imaging and you can not so much pet MRI and Cat Scan you can see**44:06**it there and it's looking there okay uh you can see it now you give the patient a vaston and uh which is this um**44:15**anti-angiogenic drug it's supposed to stop the abnormal blood vessels right they think that the angiogenesis blood**44:22**vessels is is driving the disregulated growth it's the fermentation that's driving the just regulated growth by the**44:28**way so all of a sudden you give the the tumor kind of disappears it doesn't look like it whoa patient gets all excited**44:35**The Physician looks and says look at that look at the looks like you're doing well what it does the EV what the drug**44:41**does is it causes the tumors permeate your enti your entire brain just like spreading it through**44:48**your whole brain you don't live any longer uh but you had this progression free look at the tumor so the patient**44:54**gets excited because it looks like the tumor's disa appearing with this very expensive drug but what it does is it**45:00**almost guarantees that that patient will not survive because you spread the tumor cells through the whole brain so um this**45:07**is why I call it an immoral kind of a thing but chemotherapy and sort of these radiation therapies they have proven to**45:13**keep people alive who otherwise would have died in some cases they it can and**45:19**and that's another thing we have to look at we have and I I work heavily in brain tumors and G blastomas and things like**45:24**that when you irradiate somebody's brain uh who has one of these tumors you free up massive amounts of glucose and**45:30**glutamine in the micro environment and if you look at the survival when we did survival looked at survival curves for**45:35**gleo blast throughout the world oh it's un you can't even design experiments so consistent how fast people will die it's**45:42**like all the different hospitals have the same survival same survival what are you doing well we do chemo we do**45:48**surgical debulking uh T olomide and we give steroids which raise blood sugar and we irradiate we irradiate we**45:54**irradiate everybody's dead so um not everybody but you know fiveyear survival**46:00**is is very very low 10e survival is almost zero um but if you go if you got**46:05**a breast cancer or if you got this is brain cancer I'm talking about this is freeing up now yes if you have a**46:11**circumscribed tumor and it's not anywhere else you can come in with a radiation or surgical procedure and cure**46:18**essentially cure that patient but if you have any level of spread or anything like this um that that person now and**46:26**also if you're taking a toxic poison into your body like Red Devil docar rubison they call it Red Devil your P**46:32**turns red everything turns red what is that is that chemotherapy yes is a chemotherapy to kill a small group of cells um or maybe a little bit of a**46:40**spread but your your hair falls out your body gets brutalized uh by this and then**46:46**if you survive the cancer and many people do we have millions and millions of cancer survivers on this planet but**46:52**many many folks in that group suffer from the adverse effects of being p poisoned or irradiated or surgically**46:58**mutilated I mean they have to change their whole and often times the cancer comes back or they die from**47:04**cardiovascular disease or they die from secondary adverse effects of being brutalized uh with medieval I call it**47:11**medieval approaches to this are you kidding me what they're doing to cancer patients so when we do metabolic therapy**47:19**we we shrink the tumor down for sure then the surgeon can come in and he sees**47:24**it smaller fewer blood vessels because of the metab therapy and we can take out a greater amount uh of of this and then**47:30**we transition back to prevent this tumor from recurring metabolic therapy can be**47:35**used to not only prevent the cancer but can also be used to treat the cancer now let me tell you go most hospitals**47:42**suppose people say well you know I really want to do things to prevent cancer can I do standard of care before I have a tumor what do you mean you want**47:50**to go into a uh major Cancer Clinic and have toxic doxorubicin and radiation to**47:55**your body just in the event that you might get a cancer this is absurd but yet when you have cancer that's what they do to you right but with metabolic**48:03**therapy you can use it as both a prevention and a treatment it's just that with a treatment we bring in some more drugs to Target the glutamine we**48:09**don't do that on the prevention side on the I was just looking at some stats as you were speaking around the fiveyear**48:14**survival rates of a variety of different cancers um over time and it does appear**48:20**that survival rates of these cancers from breast cancer to prostate cancer to lung cancer to leukemias um and various**48:26**melanomas has improved since the 1970s so the 1970s to the 1990s to the**48:33**2010s there's been an improvement in the survival rate um which I guess is a credit to the research that's been done**48:40**um what you're saying is that this the treatments we have still today are horrific yeah and the and the survivals**48:46**are not that much greater it's not like you're getting massively longer survivals yeah I mean and I have to I I**48:52**have to preface that these stats might not be right because this is AI we're dealing with here but the there's a 5%**48:57**for example with breast cancer between the 1990s and 2010 there's just a 5% difference in overall survival in**49:04**overall survival okay so your survival your overall survival is two and a half to three months greater I I don't  <br>**How Do We Prevent Cancer?49:10**actually have those stats in no but that's that's that's the the evidence the papers that we're looking at so so**49:15**how do we prevent prevent this then I'm 32 years old now so I want to make sure that I**49:23**live my life in such a way that I limit my chance of cancer one of the things I always reflect on is the fact that many**49:28**of the people that I know that have got cancer breast cancer or other forms of cancer appear to be remarkably healthy**49:33**yeah always at the beginning there there not always but many times the person comes in gee I**49:39**just was diagnosed with cancer I didn't know I had it I didn't feel bad I didn't and then all of a sudden you get treated and they look like death warmed over but**49:45**I'm saying like how can how can healthy people be getting cancer if there's this sort of central well because you I as I**49:50**said are the the the the and we're seeing this I'm seeing it in my own I'm getting more and more emails from young**49:57**people in their 30s uh late 20s 30s early 40s like with colon cancer breast cancer and all these kinds of things but**50:04**look at our diet and lifestyle situation today those those things that I'm talking about lack of exercise a lot of**50:10**stress poor sleep bad food all of this kind of stuff impacting parts of our**50:15**bodies so what do we do about it though know about it and then and then what do we do so I know that's personal choice**50:21**I'm not here to take pieces and and jelly donuts off the market for sure or breakfast here I love that stuff too but**50:27**the qu the question is I don't eat it every day and I know if I do it'll kill**50:34**me so so yeah skipping meals water only fat occasionally there's a lot of things**50:41**you can do to keep your mitochondria healthy okay so tell me what those things are I just exercise you look like**50:46**you're a pretty healthy guy yeah I go to I go to the gym you don't look morbidly obese to me not not yet not yet well**50:51**that's important because you don't ever want it yet we would't be in America too long so my chan well and listen it's not**50:56**just the United States we were kind of like the first ones to plow that field but it's starting to spread everywhere I think in China they have the most 200**51:03**million obese people in China now so should I be on a keto diet then here's what we did okay uh we developed the  <br>**Should I Be On A Keto Diet?51:10**glucose Ketone index calculator at Boston College all right my students and I because we were trying to uh work with**51:17**cancer patients blood sugar and ketones um independently of each other we had a**51:23**ketone meter and we had a blood glucose meter so we were monitoring ketones by itself and glucose by itself and we**51:30**worked with a very nice woman U from American who lived in East France who since passed away from a brain stem**51:37**tumor was very very difficult we kept her alive very long but eventually we didn't know what we need what we know**51:42**now but she got into an argument for a handicapped parking spot with her neighbor upstairs and her blood sug and**51:50**blood sugar went through the roof she ran upstairs and she took her blood blood sugar and she says oh my God the tumor is going to grow I said what's**51:55**your ketones and she says oh it's still 2 and a half Miller well that's still pretty high usually it's very very low**52:01**it's very high so my students and I we said you know this is too traumatic to try to measure these two independently**52:08**why don't we make a singular number divide the glucose in molar in the blood by the Ketone and Molar in the blood now**52:15**you get this number that's much more stable and it allows the cancer patient to know that if I keep this Zone in 2.0**52:22**and below my tumor cells aren't going to be able to grow very fast I did this for the brain cancer right now it's being**52:28**used for all Cancers and now it's being used for guys like yourself who just want to stay healthy and because what it**52:35**is essentially is a quantitative determination if you're in the Paleolithic zone or not oh so if I'm at**52:40**2.0 like my friend Dominic the austino he's always down in these zones he's living the P he's a Paleolithic man**52:47**living in modern society what's a Paleolithic man that's how our ancestors were during the Paleolithic period okay**52:53**so he's got the right balance of glucose and ketones in his blood like we did when we were hunting mammoths and and**52:58**Buffalos and these kinds of things when we were hunter gatherers in the thousands of years of our existence as a**53:05**species tens of thousands of years he is in that zone is he in keto yeah well**53:10**that's that's what the low gki is that means you're at a level of Keto now yes**53:15**he doesn't eat a lot of carbohydrates in his diets eats leafy vegetables and a lot of meat and and this kind of thing**53:21**sparingly on fruits uh like grapefruits we learned from the epilepsy field great fruits provide a tremendous amount of**53:28**vitamin C with don't and do not Spike glucose that's that's very interesting so you can have uh certain fruits that**53:34**can keep you in this metabolic zone of P I call it the Paleolithic Zone which is the way we evolve with there was no**53:40**cancer in our in our existence when people hear that they might start jumping on the paleo diet I don't even know what the not a paleo diet it's it's**53:47**diets that are low in carbohydrates okay okay um Mediterranean diets like people**53:52**say to me at told God what should I eat should I eat this and that normally you would eat foods that have very low low**53:57**glycemic index which means the speed with which glucose is released like a banana very high in glycemic index you**54:04**eat a banana your blood sugar immediately spikes many fruits are like that um but you want you want foods that**54:11**keep a low steady uh uh gki now I built that uh calculator for brain cancer**54:19**patients initially then we realize it's powerful for all cancers uh we put the cancer patient in the low glucose Ketone**54:25**index we get them down in there then we come in with the glutamine targeting drugs to to kind of polish off these**54:31**tumors or put them in even a more dormant state but now we finding all these young kid like yourself all these**54:36**30 20 year olds what's your gki I mean they're out to weightlifting and they're looking at their G they don't have**54:42**cancer they're just excited to see they they can get into this Paleolithic Zone by themselves and that yes that will**54:48**prevent cancer because you can't get cancer if your mitochondria healthy if if you're in a Paleolithic Zone where our ancestors rarely have ever got**54:54**cancer then you're you're back in this oh you me to tell me I can't eat this and I can't eat that what does it do to  <br>**Dr Seyfried's Dog Study54:59**your gki oh Mak it go up well don't eat that so you did a study on dogs a dog**55:05**with a tumor yes can you tell me about that study it was a woman came to me and this is what I say does you don't have**55:12**to have a a PhD in Biochemistry to understand what some of the things this**55:18**woman had no degree whatsoever she just heard the uh about what we did to these mice and she did the same thing to her**55:25**dog um it was a pitbull and at aged seven years old it had big mast cell**55:30**tumor on its lip so she listened to my YouTube video over and over she said to me I just kept listening then he says I**55:37**I got I I I I got some raw chicken she says dogs wolves evolved to eat chickens**55:43**so she got some uh chicken Cho chopped up the chicken she cut the calories of she found some dog food calculator to**55:50**how much calories the dog was getting she cut the calories the dog look lost only 5% of its body weight**55:56**she got uh pollic fish oil raw eggs and cut all the calories everything was all**56:03**natural for this dog um and all of a sudden we have the pictures you can see them in the P if you saw the picture big**56:09**big tumor on its lip that the the veterinarians said this dog is gonna to survive you have to give him chemo and**56:15**radiation and surgery and all this kind of stuff and it's going to cost a lot of money the dog's gonna have diarrhea it's going to be you know she didn't want any**56:21**part of that so she said well let's just try this metabolic thing and and she**56:27**kept all the records and the pictures and what she did and how much she gave the dog and all this so I was able to get all that information from her um put**56:35**my friend Lauren Lauren Nations who was a veterinarian uh on the paper because I said what biology guy at Boston College**56:42**is telling you how to manage cancer in a dog we got to have some veterinarian on here to validate to make sure he's there**56:47**and he looked at the pictures and we looked at all the thing and disappeared so what happened was the dog eventually**56:53**died of heart disease at 15 and a 12 years years of age so essentially that's the only when people say well metabolic**57:01**therapy cure cancer I I say metabolic therapy is never considered a cure for**57:06**cancer it's an effective non-toxic management for cancer but in the case of that dog it appeared to work to cure the**57:12**dog but that's the only one I'll say oh he's gonna say cure cannot that dog happened to get he died from old age  <br>**Human Cases Of People That Have Followed Your Research57:17**from a heart heart attack and we did it with a brain tumor guy Pablo Kelly who just passed away unfortunately from a**57:23**from a surgical um his his uh had a a major cerebral uh Hemorrhage after his**57:29**surgery from Devon England you know Devon England that's where I'm from are you from Devon yeah oh wow well Pablo**57:35**was there he just passed away fortunately we've talking to him the day before he passed away Pablo Pablo Kelly**57:41**so he was from Devon England had a gleo blastoma which is the worst of the worst uh they said and he's all over your your**57:48**newspapers there and Devon he was always sending me articles from England um man**57:53**rejects standard of care so he he had this gleo blastoma and they took the**57:58**tissue out which is brain cancer yeah brain the worst of the brain cancers you know uh they took the tumor out and they**58:04**said oh you it's in inoperable inoperable and uh but if you do**58:10**radiation in chemo uh we you might live nine maybe 12 months at the most well**58:15**Pablo came from a family of like we don't dabble and and this kind of medicine we're more holistic kind of**58:22**people so he emailed me this was in 2014 um and said I want to try this metabolic**58:29**thing so he rejected uh chemo and radiation and they said it wasn't**58:35**surgically capable of being completely removed anyway so he did this I I gave**58:41**him the information that I give to everybody and this was way back before we knew a lot of what we now know and uh**58:48**I said this poor guy he sees another one and they said you're going to be dead they they brow beat him they try to force him to put the radiation mask on**58:55**they hacked his beard off uh all this kind of stuff and he just jumped up he said I can't do this stuff so um he**59:01**didn't take any steroids he didn't take any any radiation he didn't take any chemo he just did the metabolic therapy**59:07**and he's on English telev or things with all of his paleo diet which actually a low very low carbohydrate diet he had**59:13**the avocados there he had the fish oil there he had this different stuff two three years go by he emails me**59:20**I said gez Pablo I thought you would have been dead you're still alive what's going on with that**59:27**so so he calls me up and he says you know um I went in for a CAT scan the**59:32**other day doctors are like still surprised that he's alive and they said this tumor is is still there and it's**59:38**growing and they think they can cut it out now so he was three years on on just**59:43**metabolic approach he didn't take any glutamine Inhibitors which was really remarkable so so anyway he asked me and**59:50**I have I have physician friends that a radiologist that can look at it and we measured it when it was first first**59:57**diagnosed in 2014 and then we saw it did become a little bigger so and the now**1:00:02**the surgeon said I think I can get it looks more more receptable here it was inoperable now it becomes receptable so**1:00:08**he took it out and um Pablo recovered really well and uh the surgeon says I**1:00:14**think I got it all wow so so and and Pablo is measuring his glucose Ketone**1:00:19**index with our Keo monitor so I had every day sometimes two and three five years of data on Pablo can you believe**1:00:26**this so so anyway Pablo thinks he's cured because the the surgeon all of a**1:00:33**sudden he goes back to his kind of weak weak ways and you can see the his gki**1:00:38**goes up and all of a sudden the tumor starts to show up again puts the fear of God back into him goes back on a more**1:00:44**restrict condition another three years goes by and this time the tumor is growing slowly very slow don't forget**1:00:51**gleo blastomas kill you very quickly um with standard of care you can barely get out of at his age if you can get two**1:00:57**years you're doing you're doing really good so anyway now he's three and he's got six years out and he says you know**1:01:04**um uh it's still back you know he I got to go in so it first so this is second debul first debul goes off gets back on**1:01:12**another second debulking another three years goes by he has a third debulking can you believe this the debulking**1:01:17**debulking is the cutting the tumor out it's the removal surgical removal of this tumor but he's never had radiation**1:01:23**or chemo or any of the kinds of stamp what we call standards of care so for**1:01:28**and now um he he has uh I talked to him a couple of weeks ago and uh he was**1:01:35**doing he was doing really really good he had the the third removal and we were laughing with myself and Dr duer and my**1:01:42**associates he says yeah can you imagine um uh I've had now three operations on a**1:01:49**previously inoperable tumor so we were saying wow they got**1:01:55**that wrong didn't they follow and they kept wanting to irradiate him and do all this stuff and he said no no going to keep doing this and so we were speaking**1:02:03**to him and and uh he's out 10 years the tumor was was diagnosed in in in August**1:02:10**2014 and he passed away August uh 2024 from they try to go in and get the**1:02:17**last bit of tumor out of his brain he came out of we got him uh we talked to him a thumbs up smiling talking like**1:02:23**crazy six hours later cereal hemr and need dies so uh he didn't die from the cancer he died from the a surgical**1:02:31**problem with the surgery so he was a you talk about long-term survivors uh you**1:02:36**rarely survive two years with a gleo blastoma the fact that he was out 10 years and if he hadn't had that last bit**1:02:42**of surgery the guy would have still been alive because he was talking like you and I are talking this is a guy who has a a terminal so I said to Pablo I said**1:02:50**you could outlive me I I says I said we're all terminal to some extent right we're never all of us aren't going to**1:02:55**live to I said sure he was a young guy he was only 20 22 or 23 when he was diagnosed he was in his 30s now when he**1:03:01**passed away 10 years so he's 33 34 years old and and I said you know I could be**1:03:07**dead before you and we were laughing and we had a good time and then next thing I know I got an email from his wife he**1:03:12**said Pablo is is on on on on brain dead and something I said what**1:03:17**the hell happened what happened to this poor guy and it wasn't the cancer so um**1:03:23**who how know I don't know what how long you would have lived how many more things but what I'm saying oh he's an**1:03:29**anecdote well listen if I had a drug that did what what metabolic therapy did and I could get more people like Pablo**1:03:35**are you kidding me they'd be run running all over the world and when you say metabolic therapy you mean the  <br>**What Is Metabolic Therapy?1:03:40**combination of the calorie restrictive yeah ketogenic approach yes avoiding well first of all you're avoiding you're**1:03:47**avoiding things that are going to kill you the radiation is going to kill you for the for many people not all people**1:03:52**okay everybody say well well listen you can you can look at go have people look at the data themselves for crying out loud and you can see how long you're**1:03:58**going to live he didn't do what they what they grab everybody in what did he do specifically he didn't take radiation**1:04:03**or chemo yeah and he brought his glucose Ketone index down to the 2.0 Zone and**1:04:08**kept it kept it low and he took some supplements and a few things here and there but he wasn't really targeting the**1:04:15**glutamine like we thought it with like we we thought we we found now certain parasite medications will be effective**1:04:20**in targeting glutamine so we're doing all non-toxic strategies to manage cancer you don't have to be brutalized**1:04:26**by the system if you know what to do and how to do it the problem the problem is most of the poor oncologists never heard**1:04:32**of what I'm talking the stuff I'm telling you right now they never heard of it the risk is someone gets cancer that's listening to this or someone has  <br>**What Should Someone That Has Cancer And Is Listening To This Do?1:04:37**cancer that that's listening to this I mean statistically there's a lot of people listening to this that have cancer right now and they're speaking to**1:04:43**their doctor and their doctor is saying chemotherapy radiation therapy etc etc gluc glucose has nothing to do with**1:04:50**tumor eat whatever you want yeah and so what' you say to those people who are they've just got a DI agnosis um and**1:04:57**their doctors are saying right listen this is pretty bad severe we're going to suggest that you take chemotherapy yeah**1:05:03**you're not telling them not to take chemotherapy are you I'm not telling them that and what we found what we found is that when you are in uh**1:05:10**nutritional ketosis with a glucose keto index of 2.0 or below my colleagues that**1:05:15**we work with in Istanbul Turkey were able to show that chemotherapies at much lower dosages can be even more**1:05:22**therapeutically powerful when you're in nutritional ketosis so you don't have to get rid of a lot of these different**1:05:27**procedures that we have today I'm just saying radiation for brain cancer I'm not saying radiation for lung or some of**1:05:33**the other cancers okay because if you can if you can shrink those tumors down and make them very weak and vulnerable a**1:05:39**surgical procedure a radiation procedure even lowd dose chemo could come in and even immunotherapy if you if you took a**1:05:46**big tumor and shrunk it down to a small small nub and it's resistant to a lot of the things they all have to share**1:05:53**something in common for them to survive have this this path that might be an immunotherapy could come in because**1:05:59**they're going to Target whatever all of them have together and you could possibly get rid of it that way I'm thinking of a friend of mine that um has**1:06:06**been diagnosed with brain cancer brain tumor and this is one of the most you**1:06:11**know it's a it's a woman in her 40s or 50s trying to keep her Anonymous as possible um who is just the most fit**1:06:20**athletic person that I I know eats amazingly well is literally known for**1:06:26**exercise um and I'd go how how is it possible that someone who I would probably say is fitter than I am if you**1:06:31**looked at their sort of metabolic Health has got a severe brain tumor well it it**1:06:37**they can stay healthy for uh and I'm not saying everybody who has and it depends**1:06:42**on what kind of a tumor it is as well is it a gly blastoma alod dendral Goma you know Panet there's a lot of different**1:06:49**kinds of tumors that want to know that it's it's not growing necessarily but it's big and it's in the brain and**1:06:54**they're going to remove for surgical operation well if they can what we always suggest for the brain cancer if you do metabolic therapy up**1:07:01**front and I've had uh surgeons tell me this uh you can shrink it down because**1:07:07**one of the um one it's angry it's an angry thing right and you can see some**1:07:12**slight Invasion if you can shrink that down so that it's more circumscribed now the surgeon can look at and go oh my God**1:07:18**we we know uh many many scientific Publications the more you can debolt that's called the removal of the tumor**1:07:25**debulking the longer the patient will survive the evidence is massive to support that but you know with a lot of**1:07:31**these brain tumors you don't get it all and there's always some little piece that remains and when you irradiate you**1:07:36**explode the ability to the cells to ferment energy and it's very hard to kill them but but if you can get the**1:07:43**majority of it out and then transition the patient back into a metabolic State keeping the pressure on those tumor**1:07:49**cells you can remain healthy like Pablo I mean these these guys can and when you found in mice is that when ketogenic  <br>**Keto Plus Hyperbaric Oxygen Study1:07:54**diet was combined with a hyperbaric oxygen therapy the average survival time was increased by roughly 80% yeah even**1:08:01**more sometimes now but what okay so why do we hyper do hyperbaric oxygen right**1:08:07**that's the question what's going on with hyperbaric oxygen why is this like a good thing it works best when the**1:08:13**patient and the mouse is in nutritional ketosis okay so look we have a tumor we**1:08:20**iriate that tumor how does the radiation kill the tumor cells it hits oxygen blows up and it causes a reactive R and**1:08:28**it's like a a stepping on a landmine it blows the tumor up right so um cancer**1:08:35**cells protect themselves even though they make a lot of rust they all they're this close to death anyway but they have**1:08:41**a very powerful antioxidant system and interestingly enough that besides**1:08:47**causing the disregulated growth the glucose and the glutamine also protect**1:08:52**them to some extent from the Ross that they're making and can you believe this the Ross r r reactive oxygen species**1:09:01**that are carcinogenic and mutogenic so they're they destroy our our our proteins lipids and and nucleic acids**1:09:09**they're disruptive molecules so radiation will cause a Ross in the micro environment Ros that'll blow up and kill**1:09:16**cells normal and and tumor cells but but if you want to selectively kill tumor cells you with Ross Not to cause your**1:09:24**hair to fall out your gums to bleed and all this crazy stuff you take the patient you put him in nutritional**1:09:30**ketosis and you say he's l a low gki then you go into hyperbaric oxygen which**1:09:35**dissolves oxygen directly into your blood now it's better than just breathing 100% oxygen because you can**1:09:40**actually dissolve oxygen in the bloodstream then you're taking away the two fuels that protect the tumor and**1:09:47**you're giving it internal Ross which kills the tumor internally only to the tumor cell not to your surrounding**1:09:53**tissues so you're killing selectively killing tumor cells without collateral damage to your to the rest of your body**1:09:59**as a matter of fact the rest of your cells are getting super healthy because they're burning ketones in pure oxygen**1:10:04**unbelievable how do we measure if our um can you believe this I can't even believe I'm saying this stuff**1:10:10**myself you really got to know the biochemistry and you have to know the physiology of your own body and you have**1:10:15**to understand evolutionary biology most people just aren't that intelligent including me it's not**1:10:21**intelligence most people most people kind of want things sort of simple principles that they can**1:10:27**live by and Implement and also quick and easy yeah of course okay they don't want to do what I'm talking about it because**1:10:33**it might be or the other thing let me tell you one thing and remember it if you do metabolic therapy success rides**1:10:39**heavily on your shoulders you're not sitting there like some Pawn with mannequin some guy's poison and radiating you to to make metabolic**1:10:46**therapy work you are the one doing the gki you're the one in your it's your**1:10:51**soul it's your you're responsible for your existence on this planet you're G to put your your precious soul in the**1:10:57**hands of someone who has less of a knowledge about the the problem than than you might as an entrepreneur I'm**1:11:04**always looking for ways to connect and to create and that's why I decided to launch the conversation cards I turned**1:11:09**to Shopify who also sponsored this podcast and Shopify made it so easy to**1:11:15**set up an online store and reach all of you no matter where you are in the world I remember the challenges we faced when**1:11:21**we first launched the DI Co conversation cards managing inventory ensuring a SC this checkout process and reaching our**1:11:27**audience Shopify stepped in and made everything so straightforward and efficient it was like having an entire**1:11:32**team of experts by our side allowing us to focus on creating

business to the next level and to say thank you for listening to this podcast we're giving you a trial which is just $1 a month and you can sign up**1:11:51**by going to shopify.com Bartlet the link is in the description destion below**1:11:56**could you be predisposed genetically to cancer yeah that's what those germine mutations but you can manage that people  <br>**Can You Have A Pre-Disposition To Cancer?1:12:03**think you know my my grandmother had breast cancer my mother had breast cancer so yeah you know they live in a common environment too it's not like**1:12:09**you're like in order to prove that you you you and all the siblings would have to be raised in a different environment**1:12:15**different countries different Lifestyles and then see if you all got cancer at the same time under all these different conditions that's definitely genetic**1:12:21**that's like Huntington's disease tayac disease or these kinds of things they'll manifest regardless of the environment**1:12:27**so you saying to me that I should as a 32y old man that's cancer-free um God willing I think God touchwood um I  <br>**Should I Restrict What I Eat, To Stave Off Cancer?1:12:34**should calorie restrict myself to keep my mitochondria healthy and my**1:12:40**metabolism healthy now I should be in a in a sort of restri I say it's good to**1:12:46**visit the state our Paleolithic ancestors had no choice there wasn't a**1:12:51**doughnut shop on every corner there wasn't pizzas there were there weren't the kinds of Highly processed carbohydrate Foods available to them so**1:12:58**should I be fasting should I be doing keto I you know I don't want to tell you what you should or should not do I'm not a physician here I'm a scientist I study**1:13:06**what causes these things and I study how to manage them you have to read what I'm saying and you have to come to your own**1:13:12**decisions about how you want to conduct your life I've given you information what's your view on fasting fasting is a  <br>**What's Your View On Fasting?1:13:19**powerful uh way to get your body into nutritional ketosis but it ain't easy try doing it try you try doing it see**1:13:26**how how easy it it ain't easy right uh but that's why we developed this procedure where if you go um rather than**1:13:33**going cold turkey uh say well today I'm gonna have a big I'm G eat as much as I can and then tomorrow okay you can go**1:13:39**the I can it's the second third days when you start to really know what the hell is going on believe me I've tried**1:13:44**it it's It Ain't Easy that's why we developed uh a zero carb diet for 14 days 10 to 14 days just zero eat meat**1:13:52**fish chicken whatever you want but just don't eat any bread pasta this kind of thing on keto um how do we get into that  <br>**How Do I Get Into The Keto State?1:14:00**sort of ketosis state that people often talk about measure your glucose Ketone index how do do that with the the the**1:14:06**keto Mojo meter you can buy it from Amazon okay okay you can buy now don't forget they get a free Libra meter now**1:14:12**for the blood they're working on Ketone blood meters but it's not there yet right now the keto Mojo or some other**1:14:18**keto meters where you could take a prick your finger like a diabetic you take a glucose strip and you put it on the**1:14:23**blood and you put it into the machine it tells you what your glucose is squeeze your finger a little bit more take the Ketone strip touch it to the blood put**1:14:30**it in the meter it gives you the Ketone value push the button gki comes right up okay okay very simple everybody can buy**1:14:38**it from from Amazon get the meter buy the consumables uh and then they can test it this is what Pablo this is what**1:14:44**all the the cancer patients the ones who really want to get into metabolic ketosis I think I've tried keto before**1:14:49**and I say think because I didn't measure my my keto level I was assuming I did yeah no it's really people say well I**1:14:55**haven't eaten you know I'm in ketos how do you know well I blew into this thing and the bulb came out I peed on a strip it looked like it was ketosis they are**1:15:02**indirect measures the most accurate is the blood measure so um it's hard to stay in that state for most people right**1:15:09**this is one of the things because the Temptations in our society are so strong yeah I mean Paleolithic man had no**1:15:16**choice do you think he that was his State that's all he knew for thousands and thousands tens of thousand hundreds**1:15:21**of thousands of years that's all he knew he didn't say let me go down to get a big jelly fil donnut down at the at the**1:15:28**end of the the river there no there's none of that he had to live in that state now we have so many Temptations**1:15:34**all the things that we are biologically clear for when you see obesity that's**1:15:39**evolution in action they are the descendants of our long ancestors that**1:15:44**could hold on to energy so efficiently we were an energy starved species for**1:15:50**the majority of our existence on the planet so anything we ate would be very little we never pee out glucose glucose**1:15:56**is converted to fat and we store energy as fat so those guys are energy efficient human beings now all of a**1:16:04**sudden we find oursel with everything and that's Evolution and action man that we're just we're just you're allowing to**1:16:11**see the how we can store energy so efficiently because our ancestors liveed**1:16:17**through such um environmental forcing we had famines we had long TRS**1:16:23**we our body could store energy so efficiently because it wasn't we had to store what little we could get from the**1:16:29**environment now you've got you know 300 million Americans in this food environment where when when they walk out their front door they see the Dunkin**1:16:35**Donut they can lie in bed and order a Dunkin Donut to their front during 10 minutes you don't even have to unas the**1:16:40**car they hand it through the window yeah no energy no energy expenditure energy in so so you know giving them this**1:16:47**information might be fairly futile because the tempt well that's I'm not here to tell people again I'm not here**1:16:53**to tell people what they should or should not do I'm just here to explain like why do we have all this not mystery**1:16:59**it's all biological evolution you understand biological evolution almost everything that I'm talking about makes**1:17:04**perfect sense um and unfortunately that's not part of our scientific literacy anymore so we need what  <br>**Do We Need More Discipline?1:17:10**discipline discipline is important um discipline is important um you know**1:17:16**every major religion had had a point of fasting um to be whether you're Islamic**1:17:25**Judaism or whatever Catholicism Hinduism whatever I don't whatever they always**1:17:31**had some sort of fasting why why you do fasting because you want to purify your body you want to become closer to God**1:17:36**you want to you want to you want to feel in control uh and that's always part and**1:17:41**if you do it with prayer it's even better so uh there was a reason for doing all that and uh people realized**1:17:48**the Ancients uh knew this kind of thing but uh we don't do that anymore uh we**1:17:53**don't go 40 days without food like Jesus did in the deserts um but a human being**1:17:59**you could absolutely do that I I know because I can look at your weight I can look at your size and I can pretty much**1:18:04**tell you how long you can go with before you died and how do I know that because George Cahill a good friend late George**1:18:11**kale ran the D jlin diabetes center and he he he evaluated people that would**1:18:16**just could water only fasting on until until death and um and some of those**1:18:22**conon MA prison and things so he was able to know how much you could how long**1:18:29**you could go now what about um Angus barbar went 377 days uh without food  <br>**What Happens When You Fast?1:18:36**George Cahill would fast some of these obese people for for 250 300 days what**1:18:41**happens inside their body with with they're burning fat so what happens is you burn fat okay liver stores a lot of**1:18:47**of um bone store the minerals that you can get minerals from your bones you can get a lot of fat storage um vitamins are**1:18:55**stored in fat a lot of vitamin D outside of the weight loss what's going on in you know we said PE religious people**1:19:01**used to fast to get closer to God yeah which seems to me to point to some sort of cognitive change yes and that's from**1:19:07**burning ketones yeah burn when you burn K I said in the brain when your brain starts shifting to ketones your energy**1:19:13**uh the bang for the buck for each calorie that comes in from a ketone body increases the efficiency of oxidative**1:19:19**phosphorilation so you more focused massively and you know this is**1:19:25**why our ancestors with the way that if you're if you are dependent on killing**1:19:30**some animal uh for your survival and you are out on the hunt you are focused uh**1:19:37**because if you're not focused you're going to starve to death so every organ sense organ in our body is super is**1:19:44**super jacked when you're in these ketotic states so and these guys walking around with headphones listen you know**1:19:51**all this I mean this is like depriving ourselves of the natural ways uh of our ancestry don't forget we're not just you**1:19:58**and I are not just here over the last you know 100 300 400 years we are the descendants of members that are same as**1:20:05**us you know hundreds of thousands of years ago they were they just didn't have the technology that we have today**1:20:11**but if you could brought a Paleolithic man from say 500,000 years ago and you gave him a bunch of donuts and told a he**1:20:18**would die went to heaven you mean to tell me I don't have to go out and kill the elk anymore they're going to hand me the food right through the window of**1:20:23**course he's going to do that you go in the cave and you throw a bunch of jelly fil Donuts into a bunch of**1:20:29**Caven who been chewing on the half eaten rat or something you think they're not**1:20:34**going to eat those jelly donuts they have a some chimpanzees live with a family down in Florida I know some**1:20:41**YouTube thing The Chimps they're eating the food with the family and then they give jelly sandwiches to The Chimps**1:20:47**banging on the table you think they were going to go crazy chimpanzees loving the jelly sandwiches do you have kids  <br>**What Advice Would Dr Seyfried Give To His Kids?1:20:53**yes what advice would you give to your children if they're listening to this now about um how to prevent their chance**1:21:00**of getting sick from cancer or these other well they probably say well Dad how come you don't do a lot of the things first of all I'm not telling I**1:21:05**told you I don't tell anybody what to do or or how they do it I'm just telling you the science behind why why things**1:21:12**work um yeah my my my my my children my two sons and my um they're all very very**1:21:19**successful and uh they they said if we ever got cancer we would be doing your we would be doing metabolic therapy if**1:21:25**we were to ever get cancer and I said just keep you know exercise and and do what you can do the best you can in our**1:21:31**environment I mean don't get me wrong I'm eat I'm eating a jelly donut I'm drinking beer I'm drinking whiskey why**1:21:38**because I like it but I'm not going to be doing it all the time you know it's just it's just I'm not going to be**1:21:43**saying oh I'm going to eat pizza sure but I'm not going to be uh uh not doing it I do water I do intermittent fasting**1:21:50**I don't eat for 18 20 hours at a time I do a lot of exercise over at the university the gym and the facilities**1:21:57**that we have um but I but I understand and then if I were to get cancer I would**1:22:02**have to um bite the bullet and do what I'm do what I know works as much as it wouldn't be pleasurable but it would be**1:22:08**certainly a better alternative than being radiated and poisoned I'm telling you that if that has built your  <br>**Why Isn't Dr Seyfried Trying To Be Metabolically Perfect?1:22:14**conviction to the point that you're so convinced that the real issue is this sort of metabolic dysfunction**1:22:20**um why aren't you optimizing your life to be sort of metabolically perfect well because I live in the same Society you**1:22:26**do yeah okay and and fortunately yes our technology has improved uh**1:22:33**significantly um you know I'm not a monk I'm not going to be in some Monastery you know chanting something um I I I am**1:22:41**a member of the society just as you are and I enjoy the things that we have to offer us to make our lives a little bit**1:22:48**more pleasurable there's nothing like sitting down over a nice meal and having a discussion with some wine and enjoying**1:22:53**it and en jooy the moment but don't but not to be locked into that kind of uh**1:22:59**diet and lifestyle all the time uh puts you at risk there's an election going on  <br>**What Food Laws Would Dr Seyfried Introduce?1:23:05**in the United States at the moment Trump versus Camala Harris um if you won the**1:23:10**election and you became president of the United States and you had to introduce some regulations or some laws around**1:23:16**food and all of these kinds of things what would you do well I I think you**1:23:21**know you're were talking about a food industry you're talking about a multi-dimensional economy I I would not**1:23:29**again you don't want government to tell you what you should do you should make**1:23:35**the choices but you have to recognize are there are there choices and what are these choices right now we're not in and**1:23:41**we're not seeing or understanding uh how things harm people if if we have an**1:23:47**obesity epidemic and that would put you at risk for all these horrific chronic diseases why do they not know that we we**1:23:55**introduced some regulation in the UK regarding smoking so you can't smoke inside anymore well that's but do you see this your secondhand smoke can**1:24:02**impact negatively the person sitting next to you this uh uh obese person's**1:24:07**personal choice to be obese is not going to make you obese or sick so this is a different kind of a situation um it that**1:24:15**has to come from internal to the person and they have to be concerned with their own health what about drugs though like**1:24:20**cocaine is not legal so why can't they intervene to say you can't have Dunkin Donuts um because they're both you know**1:24:29**gonna harm the indivual I think you'd get a revolution if you can't eat a Dunkin Donut you were not going to get a revolution if you can't have**1:24:35**C you try take go down here in Brooklyn and take away all these Donuts from people you know you're going to see**1:24:42**they're going to go you know it's it's like it's personal choices I I I I like**1:24:47**Dunkin Donut I mean I like the coffee especially but um but you can go to donnut shop and get some of these**1:24:53**crawlers and jelly fills and Honey Dipped are you kidding me these things are delicious you ever get these blueberry muffins you tremble while you**1:24:59**eat some of this stuff you know it's and I'm not going to take that away from me but if I want one I'm not going to be oh every day I got to eat no I just don't**1:25:06**eat it I on the weekend I might get one and even sometimes two or three weeks months go by before I'll get one you**1:25:12**know but uh but when you get it man you enjoy it you really love it are you  <br>**Is Dr Seyfried Hopeful?1:25:18**hopeful I am very hopeful because PE when the science comes you can't**1:25:23**suppress the truth it's going to come out the evidence the scientific evidence is there I'm documenting this scientific**1:25:30**and it's based on the shoulders of OT warberg are you kidding me I mean this was a giant in the field of biochemistry**1:25:35**it's not like I made this stuff up I'm just extending what he has done to a new dimension and putting it into a**1:25:41**practical application which he had never done so it's just an extension of of of**1:25:46**the knowledge base o over this time why' you care so much why do I care so much**1:25:52**you know I'm not in it for the you know what I'm in it for I want to see the the scientific**1:25:59**principles substantiated if you know that you can keep these people alive at a higher**1:26:05**quality of life based on the knowledge of the science that's doing that that's gratification man it's gratification to**1:26:13**know that these if because because you arise on understanding the mechanism of the problem and if you say you know if**1:26:20**we do it the way we're writing a big treatment protocol as we speak it's review a really comprehensive treatment**1:26:26**protocol and we Institute that in the clinic and for G blastoma patients and these Advanced cancers they're not**1:26:32**they're not living a few extra months they're living several years longer why because you knew the science what's**1:26:39**wrong with that that's that's gratification you don't have to make a billion dollars on that all you have to**1:26:45**know is that all those folks are living longer because you understood the science that was put into practical application what's WR that's our our**1:26:53**research is supported by philanthropy and private foundations that money allows me to to to do these experiments**1:26:59**to test what I'm testing on pre-clinical models and then we translate it back into the clinic directly and we see like**1:27:06**Pablo Kelly he should have been done he should have been done years and years ago he lived all those years extra he's**1:27:12**had a wife and he's got kids he didn't have to have his sperm Frozen he didn't have to have any of that stuff done**1:27:18**what's wrong with that keep I'm seeing people that are should have been dead a long time ago and they're still alive**1:27:23**and they're saying I'm doing fine I get calls from people geez I thought that guy would have been a goner he's still**1:27:28**alive he's doing well I said that that keeps me going because it tells me that we're on the right path this is a**1:27:35**solvable problem this cancer this cancer can be dropped significantly you can**1:27:41**take away the fear people now put the put it on their shoulders I know what to do how to do it I'm going to follow this**1:27:46**will it work for everybody no well it will help a lot of people much more than what we have today but it's Paradigm**1:27:52**change massive paradigm change so uh they will come to know it's just a**1:27:58**matter of time I don't know how long it's going to take but I ain't going anywhere I'm continuing to do this I'm going to get better and better results**1:28:04**and we're going to keep pushing I published these case reports in the scientific literature let the scientific field uh make their decision on the**1:28:11**results from these papers and if you are to succeed what happens people improve  <br>**And What If You Are Successful?1:28:17**um what I'm not going to live forever so but I know that what I've done with with**1:28:23**following Auto warberg and cleaning up the misconceptions and misunderstanding of why he he was stalled when the field**1:28:29**ran off chasing jeans we got to bring bring it back on track it's a metabolic problem with metabolic U Solutions so**1:28:37**that will help a lot of people but it's also going to change a lot of way people are thinking about this but I I can tell**1:28:43**you they want to open clinics I get calls from from Asia Africa South America they want to open clinics people**1:28:50**are being brutalized by a system that's not working don't forget besides the terrible Financial tox the personal**1:28:57**physical toxicity people have gone bankrupt their marriages are falling apart because they can't pay for the**1:29:03**expensive drugs on these cancer things and they die and the bills are passed on to their level this is immoral stuff is  <br>**Are There Any Studies That Have Broken Dr Seyfried's Heart?1:29:10**there a particular case study that's broken your heart more than any others Trudy Dupont who originally let me we we**1:29:18**built a glucose Ketone index calculator on her Pablo is I'm still we're still**1:29:24**ated by Pablo's loss because Pablo was a a guy that I've known for 10 years**1:29:29**worked him through and then all of a sudden he gets a cerebral hem and dies he was our poster child for how long you could live with a gleo blastoma on**1:29:36**metabolic therapy but he didn't die from the cancer um yeah have there's some others that we wished they could have**1:29:43**lived a little bit longer uh with the appropriate help what I find is that sometimes within the family there's a**1:29:49**lot of the guy he's I really want to do what you're doing but my wife and kids saying I'm foolish to do that so it's**1:29:56**it's still a very we're in a very early stage of this we haven't really worked**1:30:01**it out into a an effective standard yet it will come so people and the other**1:30:07**members of the family get super help when they all work together and they do it everybody says I never felt so**1:30:12**healthy in my life um gu tanom had Advanced prostate cancer he wrote a book and he's on the web and he had**1:30:19**hypertension high blood pressure overweight more obesity and all everything and then he does uh 18**1:30:25**several 18-day water only fasts got himself everything all these things went away his diabetes went away his**1:30:31**hypertension high blood pressure and the cancer can't be found so is he cured I have no idea but but he's managed yes**1:30:38**he's managed and he's healthier so what's wrong with that isn't that isn't that ultimately what medicine wants to**1:30:44**do keep people alive longer and a healthier quality of life yeah how many more do we need they say oh that's a  <br>**What Would Dr Seyfried Say To Someone Listening?1:30:51**fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke how many damn flukes do you want if there's someone listening now and I'm sure**1:30:57**there's going to be many thousands and tens of thousands of people listening um that are currently battling cancer have early**1:31:05**stage diagnosis I know I feel bad about this because people say oh I want to do medicab bolic therapy where can I go and**1:31:11**they go to their local hospital and get slapped down there's no evidence there's everything that's should come out of my mouth has never been taught to me in**1:31:17**medical school so what do you say to those people you know I say I I say the**1:31:24**I I'm sorry that the medical establishment has not come to recognize what I'm saying and then I tell them WR**1:31:31**your c i i you know it's it's the change has to be coming from the people ain't going to come from the top medical**1:31:37**schools they they are doing what they're doing very the status quo is very**1:31:42**profitable the status quo is very effective for these people but it's not helping the cancer patient uh as well as**1:31:48**it can and don't forget we're not throwing out all this stuff we're just asking people to know how to use the tools we have in a better way we don't**1:31:55**have to throw out immunotherapies radiation we don't have to throw out toxic poisons we just have to know**1:32:00**better how to use it when the patient is in this new state and the data will prove it but who's going to do that**1:32:07**who's going to do that the doctor says I'd love to do this if I but I'm going to lose my license if I do it what**1:32:12**what's going on with that they wrote the standard of care as if it were in granted can't be changed no it should be**1:32:18**flexible when new eviden|## SUMMARY  <br>Professor Thomas Seyfried discusses cancer as a metabolic disease and advocates for metabolic therapies, including the ketogenic diet.  <br>  <br>## IDEAS:  <br>- Cancer’s rising incidence suggests lifestyle changes impact its development and prevention significantly.  <br>- Traditional views perceive cancer primarily as a genetic disorder rather than a metabolic one.  <br>- Studies show cancer is rare in traditional societies, implying diet affects cancer prevalence.  <br>- Metabolic therapy utilizes dietary changes to treat cancer more effectively than conventional methods.  <br>- A ketogenic diet lowers blood sugar, potentially reducing tumor growth and enhancing treatment efficacy.  <br>- Specific metabolic therapies can improve survival rates in terminal cancer patients significantly.  <br>- The glucose-ketone index helps monitor dietary impact on cancer progression and metabolic state.  <br>- Mitochondrial dysfunction is central to cancer development, indicating a focus on cellular metabolism.  <br>- Exercise plays a crucial role in reducing cancer risk by lowering blood sugar and glutamine levels.  <br>- Emotional stress and lack of sleep negatively affect mitochondrial health, increasing cancer risk.  <br>- Metabolic therapy can be a non-toxic alternative to conventional cancer treatments like chemotherapy.  <br>- Historical evidence suggests humans evolved with diets low in carbohydrates, impacting modern health.  <br>- The industrial food environment contributes to rising obesity and chronic diseases, including cancer.  <br>- Cancer cells thrive on glucose and glutamine, necessitating their restriction for effective treatment.  <br>- The scientific community faces resistance to the idea that cancer is primarily a metabolic disorder.  <br>- Changing dietary habits can prevent and manage cancer, emphasizing individual responsibility for health.  <br>  <br>## INSIGHTS:  <br>- Embracing a holistic understanding of cancer as a metabolic disorder can reshape treatment approaches.  <br>- Lifestyle choices significantly influence cancer risk, highlighting the importance of personal dietary decisions.  <br>- The effectiveness of metabolic therapies underscores the need for integrative medicine in cancer treatment.  <br>- Progress in cancer treatment can be achieved by refocusing on metabolic health rather than genetics.  <br>- Public health initiatives must address dietary habits to combat rising cancer rates effectively.  <br>- Understanding mitochondria’s role in energy metabolism can lead to breakthroughs in cancer management.  <br>- Encouraging healthier diets may mitigate the cancer epidemic and improve overall public health.  <br>- Personal responsibility for health choices is vital in preventing chronic diseases like cancer.  <br>- Research on cancer metabolism could revolutionize how we approach prevention and treatment.  <br>- Promoting exercise and stress management can enhance mitochondrial health and reduce cancer risk.  <br>  <br>## QUOTES:  <br>- “Cancer is very preventable when the medical establishment acknowledges what I know about this disorder.”  <br>- “Cancer was extremely rare in African tribes that were living according to traditional ways.”  <br>- “Metabolic therapy can be used as both prevention and treatment.”  <br>- “If you do metabolic therapy, you can actually reduce risk for cancer.”  <br>- “Cancer is a metabolic disorder, not just a genetic disease.”  <br>- “We can selectively restrict the two fuels while transitioning the body over to ketones.”  <br>- “The mitochondria is the center of the problem with cancer, not the nucleus.”  <br>- “Cancer cells depend on fermentation energy without oxygen.”  <br>- “Fasting is a powerful way to get your body into nutritional ketosis.”  <br>- “We evolved as a species to be in nutritional ketosis for the majority of our existence.”  <br>- “Our food science and technology has evolved faster than our biology.”  <br>- “Exercise lowers blood sugar and helps manage cancer risk.”  <br>- “Metabolic therapy is an effective non-toxic management for cancer.”  <br>- “The scientific evidence is there, and it’s just a matter of time.”  <br>- “Cancer can be managed effectively through dietary changes and metabolic therapies.”  <br>- “There’s no major advance in reducing cancer death rates.”  <br>  <br>## HABITS:  <br>- Regular exercise maintains mitochondrial health and supports overall metabolic function effectively.  <br>- Monitoring blood sugar and ketone levels can help manage cancer risk and treatment effectiveness.  <br>- Following a ketogenic diet may prevent cancer by restricting glucose and glutamine availability.  <br>- Practicing intermittent fasting can aid in achieving nutritional ketosis and improving metabolic health.  <br>- Reducing processed carbohydrates in the diet supports healthier mitochondrial function and cancer prevention.  <br>- Maintaining a balanced lifestyle includes managing stress, ensuring adequate sleep, and exercising regularly.  <br>- Engaging in community and social connections enhances emotional well-being and reduces cancer risk.  <br>- Prioritizing whole foods over processed options can improve overall health and reduce disease risk.  <br>- Staying informed about dietary impacts on health empowers better food choices and cancer prevention.  <br>- Making conscious food choices helps maintain metabolic health and support cancer management.  <br>  <br>## FACTS:  <br>- Nearly two million new cancer cases are diagnosed annually in the United States.  <br>- Approximately 1,700 people die from cancer daily in the U.S., highlighting its severity.  <br>- Cancer is projected to become increasingly prevalent globally by 2050 if current trends continue.  <br>- Traditional diets in some cultures correlate with significantly lower cancer rates.  <br>- Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to the development of various cancers worldwide.  <br>- The fermentation process is central to cancer cell metabolism, emphasizing dietary impact.  <br>- The American Cancer Society reports over 600,000 cancer-related deaths annually in the U.S.  <br>- Exercise can lower both blood sugar and glutamine, two fuels driving cancer growth.  <br>- High blood sugar levels correlate with faster tumor growth in both human and mouse studies.  <br>- Cancer cells can survive without oxygen, relying on fermentation for energy production.  <br>  <br>## REFERENCES:  <br>- "Cancer as a Metabolic Disease: On the Origin, Management, and Prevention of Cancer" by Thomas Seyfried.  <br>- Research papers from Boston College focusing on metabolic therapy and cancer.  <br>- The glucose-ketone index calculator developed by Seyfried and his students for patient monitoring.  <br>- Studies on the effectiveness of ketogenic diets in managing cancer and improving survival rates.  <br>- Reports on the impact of exercise on cancer prevention and overall metabolic health.  <br>  <br>## ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY  <br>Understanding cancer as a metabolic disease emphasizes the importance of dietary and lifestyle changes for prevention and management.  <br>  <br>## RECOMMENDATIONS:  <br>- Adopt a ketogenic diet to help manage blood sugar and reduce cancer risk effectively.  <br>- Engage in regular physical activity to enhance mitochondrial health and overall well-being.  <br>- Monitor glucose and ketone levels to optimize dietary choices and health outcomes.  <br>- Incorporate intermittent fasting into your routine to achieve nutritional ketosis.  <br>- Educate yourself on the metabolic aspects of cancer to make informed health decisions.  <br>- Reduce processed foods and sugars in your diet for better metabolic health.  <br>- Foster supportive social relationships to improve emotional health and reduce stress.  <br>- Prioritize sleep and stress management as essential components of cancer prevention.  <br>- Explore metabolic therapies as a complementary approach to conventional cancer treatments.  <br>- Stay proactive about health choices and seek knowledge on cancer prevention strategies.|**Description:** In this groundbreaking podcast episode, cancer expert Dr. Thomas Seyfried

Dr Michael Israetel  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/OTrTqs9FLq0](https://www.youtube.com/watch/OTrTqs9FLq0)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.160 doing this at home will give you  <br>00:00:01.880 phenomenal overall results with not so  <br>00:00:04.359 much time investment and it's not so  <br>00:00:06.080 difficult we're talking about a su total  <br>00:00:08.320 of really yeah yeah doing that per week  <br>00:00:11.360 will radically transform your body Dr  <br>00:00:13.519 Michael Israel is a leading Sports  <br>00:00:15.360 scientist who provides noons  <br>00:00:17.320 science-based strategies on muscle  <br>00:00:18.920 building fat loss and helping people  <br>00:00:21.160 maximize their Fitness potential my  <br>00:00:23.039 mission is to get everyone in as good of  <br>00:00:26.039 shape as possible with minimum time  <br>00:00:28.439 investment so where do we start so it's  <br>00:00:30.800 the consistency that matters doesn't  <br>00:00:32.598 matter if it's 2 hours a week or if it's  <br>00:00:34.200 18 hours a week if you're consistent you  <br>00:00:36.280 can get amazing benefits and then  <br>00:00:37.600 there's specificity which is the most  <br>00:00:39.320 important principle in all of exercise  <br>00:00:41.280 science that's telling yourself okay I  <br>00:00:42.640 want bigger biceps and then focus on  <br>00:00:44.680 that and also every real working set  <br>00:00:46.840 should be challenging is there a perfect  <br>00:00:48.879 amount of repetitions to do there is  <br>00:00:50.559 it's a trade secret but it's how long  <br>00:00:53.120 will it take me to lose the muscles that  <br>00:00:54.640 I've gained if I don't go back to the  <br>00:00:55.879 gym after about 2 weeks of not lifting  <br>00:00:57.800 we start to lose muscle but most people  <br>00:00:59.399 think oh my God another 8 months just to  <br>00:01:01.640 get back to where I started but when you  <br>00:01:03.359 gain an initial amount of muscle it  <br>00:01:04.959 never goes back to the same size as when  <br>00:01:06.640 you started it's just always going to be  <br>00:01:08.360 bigger and then got a couple of hours a  <br>00:01:10.119 week I just want to get a bit leaner and  <br>00:01:11.439 I want to gain some muscle okay the  <br>00:01:12.720 first thing we do is Dr Michael are  <br>00:01:15.520 there any supplements you suggest I take  <br>00:01:17.479 whey protein casum protein what about  <br>00:01:19.360 steroids Jesus Christ I'm really going  <br>00:01:21.600 to say this he's recently on like a  <br>00:01:23.960 boatload of steroids there are a few  <br>00:01:25.960 downsides what are the downsides that no  <br>00:01:27.439 one's talking about they're unspeakable  <br>00:01:29.520 you really want want  <br>00:01:33.320 know this is a sentence I never thought  <br>00:01:36.000 I'd say in my life um we've just hit 7  <br>00:01:38.320 million subscribers on YouTube and I  <br>00:01:39.880 want to say a huge thank you to all of  <br>00:01:41.479

<br>00:02:22.000 heart let's get to the  <br>00:02:23.920 [Music]  <br>00:02:26.480 conversation Dr  <br>00:02:28.440 Michael what is the mission that you  <br>00:02:31.280 find yourself on in this phase of your  <br>00:02:34.319 life for those who would  <br>00:02:36.760 like to get everyone who would like in  <br>00:02:40.680 as good of shape as possible with as  <br>00:02:44.720 minimum of a Time investment injury  <br>00:02:48.239 probability and inconvenience in in  <br>00:02:52.239 general as possible and the highest  <br>00:02:54.000 likelihood of best results while trying  <br>00:02:56.480 to completely excise doing anything that  <br>00:02:59.440 is pointless and also I say this  <br>00:03:03.200 politely telling people things that  <br>00:03:06.280 aren't true we're trying to get as many  <br>00:03:08.680 people fit leaner more muscular more  <br>00:03:11.280 flexible healthier Etc as humanly  <br>00:03:14.560 possible to the extent that they are  <br>00:03:16.640 interested in that sort of thing because  <br>00:03:17.840 not everyone's into fitness and I  <br>00:03:19.159 understand that I mean I think I look  <br>00:03:20.799 kind of you know freaky and it scares  <br>00:03:22.519 certain people so I have a lot of time  <br>00:03:24.080 for that but if you want to get fit uh  <br>00:03:26.319 we're trying our best what are the the  <br>00:03:29.080 big myths that end up standing in the  <br>00:03:30.840 way of most people when they when they  <br>00:03:32.760 hear this conversation now what are the  <br>00:03:36.120 most frequent rebuttal that you'll get  <br>00:03:38.439 when you say that someone can get in  <br>00:03:39.879 shape and be be lean with limited time  <br>00:03:44.040 two super common ones  <br>00:03:46.360 are I don't have the time to work out  <br>00:03:50.319 and into that time to work out is  <br>00:03:52.599 included I don't have regular gym access  <br>00:03:55.040 or I technically do but I'd have to  <br>00:03:57.200 drive to the gym I just don't have the  <br>00:03:58.840 time of the bandwidth where I don't have  <br>00:04:00.280 the scheduling positioning in in my life  <br>00:04:02.400 to do this sort of thing and baked into  <br>00:04:05.519 that is the assumption that getting much  <br>00:04:08.000 healthier and much leaner and much more  <br>00:04:09.720 muscular takes like an inordinate amount  <br>00:04:11.720 of time one of the most common questions  <br>00:04:13.519 I get out in the real world when people  <br>00:04:15.599 happen to look in my general direction  <br>00:04:17.079 because usually people just kind of go  <br>00:04:18.358 like what the hell is wrong that guy's  <br>00:04:19.639 head but uh one of the most common  <br>00:04:22.120 questions I get is how many uh hours a  <br>00:04:25.120 day do you work out or how many days a  <br>00:04:26.800 week do you work out and every single  <br>00:04:28.560 person is expecting an answer that is  <br>00:04:31.160 kind of like asking the tallest  <br>00:04:33.080 basketball player you've ever met how  <br>00:04:34.520 tall they are you want an answer that's  <br>00:04:36.080 like 2 and a half meters you want  <br>00:04:38.080 something meaty and if they tell you  <br>00:04:39.600 like well I'm a meter 90 you're kind of  <br>00:04:41.479 like is that that cool and every time I  <br>00:04:44.120 tell them how much I work out which is  <br>00:04:45.680 really like it at my real like trying to  <br>00:04:49.160 be as good as bodybuilding as possible  <br>00:04:51.039 is really eight hours a week and this is  <br>00:04:53.919 to do this insane thing for people just  <br>00:04:57.400 trying to be fit and healthy Etc where  <br>00:04:59.880 talking about a sum total of 1 hour per  <br>00:05:02.800 week split into two or three 20ish  <br>00:05:06.280 minute sessions something we'll be  <br>00:05:07.520 trying later on is such a huge stimulus  <br>00:05:12.280 and can radically transform your body  <br>00:05:14.360 especially if you have attention to  <br>00:05:15.960 nutrition and that's the second thing  <br>00:05:17.800 that's a big Dogma big myth is people  <br>00:05:20.800 have ideas about what comes into  <br>00:05:24.720 nutrition and nutrition for being more  <br>00:05:27.639 lean more muscular and healthier they  <br>00:05:30.000 have all these kind of a constellation  <br>00:05:31.759 of ideas um uh Economist and philosopher  <br>00:05:34.840 Thomas soell calls them Notions so if  <br>00:05:36.759 you have a hierarchy of understanding  <br>00:05:38.919 you have Theory at the top which is like  <br>00:05:41.160 gravitation Evolution things super super  <br>00:05:43.199 confirmed just beneath that you have  <br>00:05:44.880 model like uh the standard model in  <br>00:05:46.840 physics is not quite good enough quite  <br>00:05:48.560 good enough support be a theory but it's  <br>00:05:50.120 very well understood space with a few  <br>00:05:51.680 Mysteries under that you have a  <br>00:05:53.880 hypothesis which is you know you have a  <br>00:05:56.160 real good idea formally phrased and  <br>00:05:58.479 underneath that you have a notion and an  <br>00:06:00.240 oce's just things people say and people  <br>00:06:02.400 are like uhhuh and no one even asks or  <br>00:06:04.800 answers about is this really true and so  <br>00:06:06.960 when you talk to people about nutrition  <br>00:06:08.240 or they talk to you about why they're  <br>00:06:10.160 not in such great shape another thing I  <br>00:06:12.000 get is when you're pretty jacked and  <br>00:06:13.560 lean and you sit next to someone on a  <br>00:06:15.000 plane they treat you almost like a  <br>00:06:16.759 religious figure like a priest or an  <br>00:06:18.120 imom and they're like apologize they're  <br>00:06:20.400 like Co you look like you're in good  <br>00:06:21.759 shape I just haven't been to the gym and  <br>00:06:23.000 I'm like I love you as a human being no  <br>00:06:25.039 matter all the time really all the time  <br>00:06:27.039 they apologize for the state they're in  <br>00:06:28.479 more or less yeah or they see me eat a  <br>00:06:29.960 protein bar and they're getting like the  <br>00:06:31.160 food on the plane and they're like this  <br>00:06:32.639 is bad for me huh and I'm like no it's  <br>00:06:34.080 actually quite fine and I always a  <br>00:06:35.319 little bit confused so all these ideas  <br>00:06:38.280 people have about nutrition organic  <br>00:06:41.280 artificial sweeteners are bad  <br>00:06:43.720 glutenfree GMOs um you have to have very  <br>00:06:47.520 meticulously well-prepared meals there  <br>00:06:49.840 is a ton of food that's huge laundr list  <br>00:06:52.240 of food that's unhealthy and bad for you  <br>00:06:53.800 makes you fat there are other foods that  <br>00:06:55.560 are a little bit more nuanced and  <br>00:06:56.840 difficult to find that are super Health  <br>00:06:58.120 Foods and'll radically transform you I  <br>00:06:59.879 can go on for hours about these myths  <br>00:07:01.759 but people come in with these myths as  <br>00:07:03.840 Notions as things they believe that  <br>00:07:05.479 they're like this is how it is right and  <br>00:07:07.400 when you tell them like actually that's  <br>00:07:09.000 not true a lot of them are  <br>00:07:11.240 like no way because maybe that's the  <br>00:07:13.639 first time they've heard about it so you  <br>00:07:14.960 tell people working out doesn't have to  <br>00:07:17.440 last forever if you do it intelligently  <br>00:07:19.840 which is what we specialize at RP about  <br>00:07:21.400 teaching people how to do and  <br>00:07:22.440 demonstrating digital  <br>00:07:24.000 products you can get into really really  <br>00:07:26.199 good shape with not so much time  <br>00:07:27.960 investment and it's not so difficult  <br>00:07:29.800 it's difficult in the moment as far as  <br>00:07:31.080 you got to try hard but you know an hour  <br>00:07:33.400 of trying hard a week is not the end of  <br>00:07:34.879 the world and then a nutritional front  <br>00:07:36.759 they come in and they think it takes all  <br>00:07:39.039 these crazy special things like people  <br>00:07:41.560 will watch me eat regular food and  <br>00:07:43.160 they'll be like you eat that I'm like  <br>00:07:45.400 yes like but I thought that you know but  <br>00:07:48.039 you need the super special food I like  <br>00:07:49.639 that's never been true but um people  <br>00:07:53.199 come in with their stack of ideas and  <br>00:07:57.319 these there's just dozens and dozens and  <br>00:07:59.520 myths on both ends we'll go through all  <br>00:08:01.400 of those myths but but my last question  <br>00:08:04.080 before we get into it is why does it  <br>00:08:06.520 matter to be in good shape and this is I  <br>00:08:09.639 I'm asking you here to really draw on  <br>00:08:11.280 some of the case studies that you've  <br>00:08:13.039 probably been exposed to where people  <br>00:08:15.000 have turned their lives around what is  <br>00:08:16.879 the net benefit of someone who's  <br>00:08:18.159 listening right now who's maybe heard  <br>00:08:19.479 about Fitness stuff before and has heard  <br>00:08:21.560 from personal trainers and bodybuilders  <br>00:08:23.400 and whoever else but for whatever reason  <br>00:08:25.199 they just haven't been able to get up  <br>00:08:26.680 off the sofa and get into action it's  <br>00:08:28.400 difficult you know what is why should  <br>00:08:30.520 they why should they C I love that  <br>00:08:32.519 question the first thing I'll say is um  <br>00:08:37.240 is maybe not a surprise to many of the  <br>00:08:39.240 people that know me politically I'm like  <br>00:08:41.799 super pro freedom freedom of all kinds  <br>00:08:44.279 inclusion and that means to me also that  <br>00:08:47.279 if someone doesn't want to pursue  <br>00:08:48.880 Fitness as a human being you have the  <br>00:08:51.160 same love and respect at least for me  <br>00:08:53.120 that anyone who's fit would have and so  <br>00:08:55.800 as far as like it'll just make you a  <br>00:08:57.640 better person and you you got to get fit  <br>00:08:59.640 people will see uh people that are obese  <br>00:09:02.120 and they're like look lazy and uh how do  <br>00:09:04.120 they live with themselves I don't ever  <br>00:09:06.160 think things like that not because I'm a  <br>00:09:08.079 good person I'm not a good person at all  <br>00:09:09.959 but what Fitness won't give you is it  <br>00:09:12.760 won't elevate your status as a better  <br>00:09:15.160 person in some way however the other  <br>00:09:19.839 benefits of Fitness we could have a  <br>00:09:22.720 10-hour podcast where I just go through  <br>00:09:24.640 them one one at a time and we would  <br>00:09:26.120 never get through all of them I'll give  <br>00:09:27.320 you a couple of samplings of kind of the  <br>00:09:28.680 big hitters  <br>00:09:30.600 one is Health straight up so if you  <br>00:09:34.320 reduce your body fat substantially and  <br>00:09:36.160 you increase your muscularity  <br>00:09:37.360 substantially and you adopt a lifestyle  <br>00:09:39.600 of moderate to moderately High physical  <br>00:09:43.000 activity quite  <br>00:09:45.120 regularly this is about as close in real  <br>00:09:47.240 life as we have so far to a Panacea a  <br>00:09:49.120 cure all it isn't cure all but the  <br>00:09:51.760 degree of  <br>00:09:54.000 preventative uh you won't get really  <br>00:09:56.240 sick very soon effect that has is just  <br>00:10:00.440 radical I uh just coming off of them but  <br>00:10:04.360 if it's okay to say it was recently on  <br>00:10:06.279 like a boatload of steroids like the  <br>00:10:08.920 worst ones got blood work right in the  <br>00:10:11.760 middle of that because I was very lean  <br>00:10:14.200 and very physically active and muscular  <br>00:10:16.120 my blood Works Stellar just being leaner  <br>00:10:18.880 and more muscular and more active just  <br>00:10:21.240 cleans your blood work up like  <br>00:10:23.560 crazyy and makes your longterm it  <br>00:10:27.040 increases your longevity considerably  <br>00:10:29.320 but it does something I think is pretty  <br>00:10:30.920 close to equally important it  <br>00:10:33.200 increases the kind of time you're having  <br>00:10:35.480 in your life while you're alive uh it  <br>00:10:38.680 makes it way better it reduces the  <br>00:10:40.680 morbidity and so because you can be  <br>00:10:42.600 around a long time living in an assisted  <br>00:10:44.720 care facility and like on machines to  <br>00:10:46.800 keep you that's you're alive sure but  <br>00:10:49.120 there something missing there but if you  <br>00:10:51.079 have more muscle less fat and more  <br>00:10:53.079 physical activity you ever see like an  <br>00:10:55.079 80-year-old that's like cardio walking  <br>00:10:56.680 down the street and you're like my man  <br>00:10:58.880 it'll you that so that's a big deal so  <br>00:11:01.440 Health it'll give you usually people  <br>00:11:04.279 experience a perception of Wellness  <br>00:11:06.160 that's psychological they just feel  <br>00:11:08.760 better they feel cleaner they feel more  <br>00:11:11.880 energy the cognitive benefits of health  <br>00:11:14.399 and fitness are now being addressed  <br>00:11:16.000 seriously in the literature and they  <br>00:11:17.240 have been for a little while but it's  <br>00:11:18.360 kind of  <br>00:11:19.519 swelling uh is unequivocally true now to  <br>00:11:22.360 say that regularly engaging in Fitness  <br>00:11:24.959 makes you literally smarter just  <br>00:11:27.480 straight up and it conserves your  <br>00:11:31.000 brain's cognitive health for decades  <br>00:11:34.600 into the future as you do it  <br>00:11:36.279 consistently it's just win all the way  <br>00:11:38.480 across what is your background in terms  <br>00:11:42.519 of your academic qualifications and  <br>00:11:45.279 experiences that you've had that feed  <br>00:11:47.360 into everything that you know this is  <br>00:11:49.360 sounds so pretentious I can't believe  <br>00:11:50.880 I'm using this nomenclature but I did my  <br>00:11:53.120 undergraduate work at the University of  <br>00:11:56.040 Michigan where I met uh my fellow  <br>00:11:58.800 co-founder of RP Nick Shaw and um that  <br>00:12:03.040 was in kinesiology uh specifically a  <br>00:12:05.639 subset of something called movement  <br>00:12:07.079 science I then went on to do a master's  <br>00:12:10.279 in technically strength and conditioning  <br>00:12:12.120 but exercise science at appalachin State  <br>00:12:14.560 University then I went for one year to  <br>00:12:17.079 go work in New York City with Nick as a  <br>00:12:19.160 personal trainer at the end of that  <br>00:12:21.519 process I realized that for my own  <br>00:12:23.600 personal like Vibe I just didn't know  <br>00:12:25.680 enough and I wanted to know more and so  <br>00:12:28.880 I got accepted to a PhD program at East  <br>00:12:30.800 Tennessee State University under the  <br>00:12:32.160 great Mike Stone who is probably one of  <br>00:12:34.880 the most well-published sports  <br>00:12:35.959 scientists of all time maybe definitely  <br>00:12:38.399 the conversation for the greatest  <br>00:12:39.519 American Sports scientist of all time  <br>00:12:42.079 and I went to that PhD program and that  <br>00:12:44.760 was in sport physiology and the best way  <br>00:12:46.600 we had of summarizing what it is we were  <br>00:12:48.399 learning is the thing we're learning  <br>00:12:50.240 best here is how to take good athletes  <br>00:12:52.040 and make them better and so I did three  <br>00:12:54.240 years of that it sounds like a it's like  <br>00:12:55.639 a prison time I did three years in  <br>00:12:57.600 ETSU and uh that was the conclusion I  <br>00:13:01.279 was a terminal degree I got a PhD in  <br>00:13:02.839 sport physiology and then I spent oh gez  <br>00:13:05.720 10 years in various uh professorships uh  <br>00:13:08.720 teaching and doing some research and all  <br>00:13:10.959 this other stuff I'm no longer a college  <br>00:13:13.040 professor mostly because like there's  <br>00:13:15.760 only so many things you can do at the  <br>00:13:17.240 same time well and it was kind of like  <br>00:13:19.440 this is this YouTube thing is getting  <br>00:13:20.880 kind of insane so time to Pivot to that  <br>00:13:23.320 but uh I'm still actively involved in  <br>00:13:25.360 research our company funds research I  <br>00:13:26.959 still look at manuscripts I still  <br>00:13:28.199 co-author so I'm still involved in that  <br>00:13:29.800 capacity as well so I want to start with  <br>00:13:31.519 a start if someone's listening to this  <br>00:13:33.720 right now and they have walked into your  <br>00:13:36.440 this is your uh this is your practice  <br>00:13:38.839 this is your hypertrophy practice let's  <br>00:13:40.440 say this table and they sit there and  <br>00:13:42.720 they say I would like to gain more lean  <br>00:13:45.800 muscle mass and I'd like to lose some  <br>00:13:48.519 weight um I live A busy life where do we  <br>00:13:52.120 start what step one and you know like  <br>00:13:54.839 I'm actually going to Hazard a guess at  <br>00:13:56.040 step one to see if I'm correct but for  <br>00:13:58.480 me step one is quite psychological  <br>00:14:00.920 because it's all well and good me having  <br>00:14:02.199 the tactics and strategies and the  <br>00:14:03.800 information but if I don't have the  <br>00:14:05.639 motivation none of it's going to matter  <br>00:14:08.079 anyway so is step one psychological in  <br>00:14:11.560 some way absolutely my God you should  <br>00:14:14.079 just be taking my job with this point no  <br>00:14:15.519 but okay I thought so I thought that was  <br>00:14:17.160 so what what would you do for me to get  <br>00:14:19.079 me in the right psychological  <br>00:14:21.480 mindset I would even take a step back  <br>00:14:23.600 before that okay the first thing we do  <br>00:14:26.920 is called the needs analysis and formal  <br>00:14:29.399 Sport Science a needs analysis is what  <br>00:14:33.519 do you  <br>00:14:34.600 want specifically do you want bigger  <br>00:14:37.720 arms how much muscle are you trying to  <br>00:14:40.079 gain it's a very different conversation  <br>00:14:41.560 of someone weighs 150 pounds and they're  <br>00:14:44.040 like I want to be 155 but leaner versus  <br>00:14:47.040 I weigh 150 pounds and I want to be 200  <br>00:14:49.920 ripped different timelines different  <br>00:14:52.000 approaches different trade-offs okay  <br>00:14:53.440 give me the  <br>00:14:54.399 typical answer to that question most  <br>00:14:57.360 people just open-ended to be completely  <br>00:14:58.839 honest honest you're like I just want to  <br>00:15:00.279 get much leaner and some of them will  <br>00:15:02.320 say I also want to put on a lot of  <br>00:15:03.720 muscle the muscle thing is a lot of  <br>00:15:06.040 times with females they just want the  <br>00:15:07.519 leaner part but they understand in many  <br>00:15:10.000 cases that if they just jettison their  <br>00:15:12.600 muscle entirely they end up looking more  <br>00:15:14.399 sick than healthy uh but a lot of the  <br>00:15:16.800 males leaner is important but also  <br>00:15:18.920 getting super jacked is important but  <br>00:15:20.920 how jacked and how lean that's the  <br>00:15:23.120 conversation is if they come in with  <br>00:15:24.880 totally open-ended concerns it's kind of  <br>00:15:26.399 like walking into a car dealership and  <br>00:15:27.600 being like I want a car like you going  <br>00:15:28.720 to have to be a little I we'll sell you  <br>00:15:30.120 whatever you're going to have to tell me  <br>00:15:31.680 a little bit more about what your use  <br>00:15:32.959 cases are about what your budget is so  <br>00:15:35.240 that's another big thing in a need  <br>00:15:36.399 analysis is how much time can you give  <br>00:15:40.000 to this because if someone says I want  <br>00:15:43.040 to eventually be a professional  <br>00:15:45.120 bodybuilder and I've got nothing but  <br>00:15:47.480 time in my week to do the thing think  <br>00:15:49.880 getting a very different plan than  <br>00:15:51.199 someone that's like I just want to be  <br>00:15:53.839 able to see my man down there again and  <br>00:15:57.959 like just not die soon and I have two  <br>00:16:02.120 hours a week to give you very different  <br>00:16:04.880 plan so I've got let's say I've got a  <br>00:16:07.319 couple of hours a week so you know two  <br>00:16:09.319 three hours a week that I could probably  <br>00:16:11.519 spare maybe four and I just want to get  <br>00:16:14.040 a bit leaner and I want to gain some  <br>00:16:15.360 muscle yeah I also ask what have you  <br>00:16:19.240 been doing so far tell me about your  <br>00:16:21.680 approach to Fitness and the answer could  <br>00:16:23.160 be I don't have one I've never tried to  <br>00:16:25.680 do anything once we get a lot of that  <br>00:16:27.920 information I don't want to say the plan  <br>00:16:29.839 writes itself but sort of almost now we  <br>00:16:33.120 really really really have all the  <br>00:16:35.560 details to fill in the blanks and then  <br>00:16:38.279 from there once you've done that sort of  <br>00:16:39.360 needs analysis and you've understood the  <br>00:16:40.759 investment that they're willing to make  <br>00:16:42.199 you understand what their goals are you  <br>00:16:44.240 understand their current approach to  <br>00:16:45.440 Fitness what becomes step two so if  <br>00:16:48.680 again I'm trying to embody the viewer  <br>00:16:50.000 here who's trying to change their life  <br>00:16:51.600 yeah yeah get going for step two often  <br>00:16:53.600 times uh just to keep it SCH we can I we  <br>00:16:56.079 definitely do nutrition uh if you'd like  <br>00:16:57.800 so please C me in for that but I'll just  <br>00:16:59.360 use um training as a quick example here  <br>00:17:02.480 uh a big one is do you go to a gym can  <br>00:17:07.400 you make it to a gym or are you going to  <br>00:17:09.160 be training at home because training at  <br>00:17:11.880 home is a bit of a different world you  <br>00:17:13.559 can get amazing results at home but we  <br>00:17:15.599 need to make sure you have the right  <br>00:17:16.760 equipment and it's super minimal two 20  <br>00:17:19.839 lb dumbbells I like that you're looking  <br>00:17:21.760 over at the dumbbells like are those 20  <br>00:17:23.919 kg dumbbells they're 20 pound dumbbells  <br>00:17:26.280 is that what I need at home for many  <br>00:17:28.240 people 20 like adult males white spry  <br>00:17:31.039 like yourself 20 pound dumbbells at home  <br>00:17:33.440 will give you phenomenal overall result  <br>00:17:37.039 yeah what is that nine kgs or something  <br>00:17:40.120 oh here we go your assistance are quite  <br>00:17:42.919 strong by the way thank do you fight  <br>00:17:44.760 crime in your spare  <br>00:17:47.480 time okay so these are 20 pound  <br>00:17:50.840 dumbbells You're just showing off now  <br>00:17:52.840 but but these are what I need at home to  <br>00:17:54.799 to do a workout uh yeah somewhere  <br>00:17:56.799 between 10 and 20 pounds 10 for small  <br>00:17:58.840 smaller lighter females 20 for larger  <br>00:18:01.799 more strong males somewhere between that  <br>00:18:04.480 two of those dumbbells at home and a  <br>00:18:06.799 little bit of floor space can be the  <br>00:18:08.480 beginning of an absolutely revolutionary  <br>00:18:10.400 workout program really yeah oh yeah how  <br>00:18:13.960 so give me the starting position and the  <br>00:18:16.960 end position that I could get to just  <br>00:18:19.559 with these dumbbells at home if you  <br>00:18:22.600 properly control your diet and you  <br>00:18:24.880 haven't really lifted weights before and  <br>00:18:27.039 you're let's say 30 40 50 years old in a  <br>00:18:30.440 6month time span we can reliably get you  <br>00:18:34.000 to gain 5 to 10 lounds of muscle which  <br>00:18:37.400 if you go to the store what is that like  <br>00:18:39.600 five let's say the two to five kilos of  <br>00:18:42.559 muscle you ever buy two to five kilos of  <br>00:18:44.880 meat at the store that's a lot of meat  <br>00:18:47.240 that's going on your body and we can  <br>00:18:49.720 reliably get you to lose oh gee five to  <br>00:18:54.799 7 and 1 12 kilos of fat in a six-month  <br>00:18:57.400 time frame just by being intelligent  <br>00:18:59.720 about your diet and doing two workouts  <br>00:19:03.120 per week at home with your dumbbells and  <br>00:19:05.840 the workouts each take roughly 20  <br>00:19:08.760 minutes so that's 40 minutes a week oh  <br>00:19:12.440 yeah now that's if you're unaccustomed  <br>00:19:14.039 and unadjusted if you have already and  <br>00:19:16.159 that's why those intake questions are  <br>00:19:17.400 important because if you're like look I  <br>00:19:18.720 go to the gym six times a week I spend  <br>00:19:20.120 two hours at the gym like them dumbbells  <br>00:19:22.320 can keep you in pretty good shape but  <br>00:19:24.480 they're not going to elevate your shape  <br>00:19:25.679 very likely at very least it'll be  <br>00:19:27.640 highly inefficient and incredibly  <br>00:19:29.200 discomforting for what you'd have to do  <br>00:19:30.679 with such  <br>00:19:31.760 dumbbells so what is step three then so  <br>00:19:34.080 if we've got the equipment part figured  <br>00:19:35.640 out and I guess the complicated element  <br>00:19:37.520 of that is some people have anxiety as  <br>00:19:40.240 it relates to going to the gym I've got  <br>00:19:41.480 a lot of friends that because they're so  <br>00:19:44.039 inexperienced with weightlifting or the  <br>00:19:45.799 machines they feel embarrassed to go to  <br>00:19:48.240 the gym so that well at least that's  <br>00:19:50.720 what they tell me now I don't know  <br>00:19:51.880 whether they're Beering themselves but  <br>00:19:53.679 they tell me that they have gym anxiety  <br>00:19:56.000 you know you walk and I no actually I  <br>00:19:57.320 can relate you walk into a gym  <br>00:19:58.679 especially if I go to like a uh like a  <br>00:20:00.320 bodybuilding gym and I do look around I  <br>00:20:02.480 go okay everyone here knows what they're  <br>00:20:03.640 doing more than I do o that's already  <br>00:20:05.720 wrong but we'll get to that a bit and  <br>00:20:07.240 are they looking at me are they do they  <br>00:20:08.919 know that I I don't know how this  <br>00:20:10.280 machine works and if I don't know how a  <br>00:20:11.919 machine works and there's nothing you  <br>00:20:13.720 know No Label to tell me sometimes I  <br>00:20:15.360 just avoid the machine if I'm in in like  <br>00:20:16.919 a bodybuilding gym because I [ __ ]  <br>00:20:18.600 hell I don't know how to do my wrist  <br>00:20:20.880 muscles yeah I just look like a doofus  <br>00:20:23.480 and everyone's making fun of me in their  <br>00:20:24.720 head what I think sometimes if I go to  <br>00:20:26.080 like a really Elite Gym so yeah so first  <br>00:20:28.880 of all I think people's gym anxiety is  <br>00:20:30.799 absolutely real thing I can speak to  <br>00:20:32.240 that at at length The Next Step would be  <br>00:20:35.799 to say Hey listen based on all the  <br>00:20:38.559 information we've collected on your  <br>00:20:39.880 limitations desires abilities we've  <br>00:20:43.120 cultivated a plan for you be diet plan  <br>00:20:45.559 and just just stick into the muscle  <br>00:20:47.080 growth  <br>00:20:48.200 stuff here's your plan for your  <br>00:20:52.760 training and we actually have an app for  <br>00:20:55.640 this sort of thing where we would say  <br>00:20:57.840 okay here's how you you type in all your  <br>00:20:59.320 stuff in the app the app will create a  <br>00:21:01.120 plan for you and it'll tell you here's  <br>00:21:03.919 what to do for warming up here's you  <br>00:21:05.960 know you pick a weight it tells you how  <br>00:21:07.159 to pick your weights and then it  <br>00:21:08.440 programs the rest of your two months of  <br>00:21:10.880 training for you you fill in the how do  <br>00:21:12.799 we how do I feel how am I recovering  <br>00:21:14.279 it'll take care of everything else and  <br>00:21:16.720 if you ever get confused you click on  <br>00:21:18.600 the exercise and it opens up a video  <br>00:21:20.840 with an audio demonstration of how to do  <br>00:21:23.880 it and of someone a professional  <br>00:21:25.960 bodybuilder doing the thing you go oh  <br>00:21:28.120 that's that's what bicep curls was okay  <br>00:21:29.880 got it so now you have all the answers  <br>00:21:31.880 and you don't have to have our app we  <br>00:21:34.039 think it's nice you don't have to have  <br>00:21:35.320 it just whatever kind of plan you have  <br>00:21:38.200 that's your little map of the Caribbean  <br>00:21:40.080 Sea with the AIS and the pirate ships  <br>00:21:42.240 and you know exactly where to go and  <br>00:21:44.240 it's you your app or your map of how to  <br>00:21:47.320 train your program and everyone else  <br>00:21:50.440 like in The Avengers movie it's just  <br>00:21:53.279 just floats away there's no one else  <br>00:21:54.960 there's not even any other machines it's  <br>00:21:56.559 you and the bicep curl machine  <br>00:21:59.159 and the hypertrophy app says first set  <br>00:22:01.440 is 12 reps at 50 pounds I take the  <br>00:22:03.360 select Dr stack I go to 50 and I'm nice  <br>00:22:05.559 and warmed up and I do 12 reps and  <br>00:22:07.799 that's as far as you have to think about  <br>00:22:09.120 it comparisons whatever everyone else  <br>00:22:10.679 thinks without a plan oh boy are you  <br>00:22:13.120 second guessing yourself with a plan you  <br>00:22:15.320 don't have to second guess anything most  <br>00:22:16.520 those people don't have a plan they're  <br>00:22:17.440 just in there on Vibes I feel like my  <br>00:22:19.000 delts are going to grow today if I do  <br>00:22:20.320 this like thanks thanks for that  <br>00:22:22.039 intellectual opinion you said there's  <br>00:22:24.000 two types of effective training one of  <br>00:22:27.039 them's H H can't say this but one of  <br>00:22:29.240 them is hypertrophy very good and the  <br>00:22:31.600 other one is  <br>00:22:33.760 periodization uh so periodization is the  <br>00:22:37.480 scientifically based organization of any  <br>00:22:39.880 kind of training that you want okay  <br>00:22:41.919 hypertrophy training is a type of  <br>00:22:43.679 training it's just muscle growth  <br>00:22:44.880 training it's like a fancy [ __ ]  <br>00:22:46.880 science word for just getting more  <br>00:22:49.440 jacked putting on muscle that's the  <br>00:22:51.919 technical definition of hypertrophy and  <br>00:22:54.360 when you train for hypertrophy you can  <br>00:22:56.080 do it kind of like by feel and more or  <br>00:22:57.880 less at random and you'll get pretty  <br>00:22:59.120 good results in most cases but to get  <br>00:23:00.960 your best results you want that training  <br>00:23:02.320 to be periodized periodization is the  <br>00:23:05.760 scientific approach to how to organize  <br>00:23:07.559 your training to get sort of roughly  <br>00:23:09.640 three things some of these are a bit  <br>00:23:11.240 more for athletes and not regular people  <br>00:23:13.919 get the best results that you can Peak  <br>00:23:16.679 at an appropriate time abs for summer  <br>00:23:19.520 and minimize injury risk and taking all  <br>00:23:22.400 the science that we know that plan that  <br>00:23:24.559 you've made because you did in an  <br>00:23:26.559 evidence-based fashion that is now what  <br>00:23:28.760 is considered a periodized plan so  <br>00:23:31.039 that's how those two concepts relate to  <br>00:23:32.960 each other what do I need to know about  <br>00:23:35.000 hypertrophy in order to be able to  <br>00:23:36.960 achieve it is there anything really  <br>00:23:38.440 foundational because I think everyone  <br>00:23:40.840 wants a bit of muscle growth and I spend  <br>00:23:42.880 I think I spend too long in the gym I  <br>00:23:44.159 think I could be much more efficient um  <br>00:23:46.360 when I'm training what would you  <br>00:23:48.480 recommend that I start thinking about as  <br>00:23:50.720 F foundational principles when it comes  <br>00:23:52.799 to hypertrophy muscle growth one is  <br>00:23:56.320 specificity it's the most important  <br>00:23:58.440 principle in all of sport painting and  <br>00:24:00.440 exercise science is uh what am I here  <br>00:24:03.919 for what do I want because you can do a  <br>00:24:06.919 bunch of exercises in the gym and you're  <br>00:24:09.159 like that was great and someone's like  <br>00:24:10.720 are you getting the results you like  <br>00:24:11.679 you're like well I what I want is a  <br>00:24:13.120 bigger bicep like how many bicep  <br>00:24:14.720 exercises do you do like I think upright  <br>00:24:16.720 rows maybe so I want a bigger bicep  <br>00:24:18.840 bicep if we just focus on me give  <br>00:24:20.440 getting Steven B a bigger left bicep so  <br>00:24:24.760 specificity is telling yourself okay I  <br>00:24:26.279 want bigger biceps and whatever XYZ  <br>00:24:28.399 other  <br>00:24:29.200 muscles then we move in to the principle  <br>00:24:32.399 of overload which means you have to  <br>00:24:35.120 challenge  <br>00:24:36.440 yourself if most of your  <br>00:24:39.559 sets someone else watching them can't  <br>00:24:42.080 tell if you're warming up or doing  <br>00:24:43.600 what's called a working set like a real  <br>00:24:45.159 set you have a problem so towards the  <br>00:24:48.039 end of all of your sets either the  <br>00:24:50.360 weights are slowing down or even if it's  <br>00:24:53.720 the same speed to you they feel  <br>00:24:55.480 perceptively harder you know you do this  <br>00:24:57.960 this this and in a couple reps you're  <br>00:25:00.720 like that's what you want every real  <br>00:25:03.600 working set should be challenging you  <br>00:25:05.720 should be work approaching every real  <br>00:25:07.320 set with just a teeny teeny dose of  <br>00:25:09.600 trepidation like oh boy here we go I'm  <br>00:25:13.000 GNA have to  <br>00:25:14.279 try once you have that and a set is a a  <br>00:25:18.080 group of repetitions correct so if I do  <br>00:25:20.720 10 repetitions that's one set one set  <br>00:25:22.799 yeah and so your sets have to be  <br>00:25:25.399 sufficiently heavy uh anything between  <br>00:25:28.320 between roughly five reps per set and 30  <br>00:25:31.200 reps per set where the last few reps are  <br>00:25:33.440 getting close to you not being able to  <br>00:25:34.919 use good technique and lift the weights  <br>00:25:37.279 check plus so there's not a set a  <br>00:25:39.640 perfect amount of repetitions to do  <br>00:25:41.840 there is it's a trade secret and I'd  <br>00:25:43.279 have to say it off camera to you like ND  <br>00:25:45.600 assign okay we're off camera all right  <br>00:25:47.080 great so it's  <br>00:25:48.480 17 um there is so there's just tons of  <br>00:25:51.880 tons of contextual Nuance kind of stuff  <br>00:25:54.720 some people some of their muscles will  <br>00:25:56.600 seem respond better to sets a five to 10  <br>00:25:59.279 other folks even the same person could  <br>00:26:01.159 have muscles in their body that really  <br>00:26:02.360 respond better to sets of 20 to 30 and  <br>00:26:04.840 everything in between but generally you  <br>00:26:06.039 get in in the exercise science data  <br>00:26:09.039 you'll have a group of people training  <br>00:26:10.919 for sets of roughly five reps and  <br>00:26:13.360 another group training for sets of  <br>00:26:14.760 roughly 30 reps and their change in  <br>00:26:17.039 muscle growth over 8 12 16 weeks is  <br>00:26:19.480 statistically undifferenced  <br>00:26:28.600 that's so crazy using the same weight  <br>00:26:30.760 I'm guessing different weight a weight  <br>00:26:32.840 that is challenging for five reps is  <br>00:26:34.279 much heavier than a weight that is  <br>00:26:35.320 challenging for 30 okay so I do Wonder  <br>00:26:37.200 this all the time when I go to the gym I  <br>00:26:38.279 wonder if I should be doing I don't know  <br>00:26:40.320 30 reps of 10 kg on my bicep or I should  <br>00:26:42.960 be doing 10 reps of 20 kg they're both  <br>00:26:46.360 right answers no wrong answers there and  <br>00:26:48.120 they both have the same chance of  <br>00:26:50.559 growing my muscles as long as the strain  <br>00:26:53.120 that I experience subjectively is  <br>00:26:55.799 difficult at the end of those set  <br>00:26:57.080 correct okay interesting which is really  <br>00:26:59.120 good news because that's like another  <br>00:27:00.360 thing you don't have to worry about  <br>00:27:01.760 which means at home I can get any range  <br>00:27:03.159 of Weights versus having to get really  <br>00:27:05.559 really big ones to gr as long as they're  <br>00:27:07.039 not so tiny that you're on rep number 45  <br>00:27:09.120 and you're like I could just do this for  <br>00:27:10.240 forever or they're not so enormous that  <br>00:27:12.240 you're like I can't really even do two  <br>00:27:13.679 reps of this anything between roughly  <br>00:27:15.399 five and roughly 30 reps challenging is  <br>00:27:18.159 really really good how many sets and how  <br>00:27:21.240 often do I have to visit the gym to get  <br>00:27:24.279 this bicep to grow that answer depends  <br>00:27:26.640 on how much you've been doing before  <br>00:27:28.640 okay but if you're new to the gym two  <br>00:27:31.559 sessions a week with two to three sets  <br>00:27:35.440 per session for your biceps is something  <br>00:27:38.640 that's going to cause months and months  <br>00:27:40.200 and months of consistent progress can  <br>00:27:42.559 you do more yes do you have to do as a  <br>00:27:45.760 beginner no eventually as a more  <br>00:27:48.000 advanced person do you need to do more  <br>00:27:50.039 sets and perhaps more sessions to get  <br>00:27:51.679 consistently better results yes but for  <br>00:27:53.919 beginners who haven't been in the gym  <br>00:27:55.200 very much or at all the minimal  <br>00:27:57.320 effective dose is profoundly small which  <br>00:28:00.640 is why I can say things like if you work  <br>00:28:02.039 out for 20 minutes twice a week you're  <br>00:28:03.360 going to get great gains what if I go to  <br>00:28:05.480 the gym and I do six sets on my biceps  <br>00:28:09.120 and I just go to the gym once a week  <br>00:28:10.960 does the distance between the workouts  <br>00:28:13.519 in a muscle group have an impact yes  <br>00:28:16.919 once a week training gives you good  <br>00:28:18.880 results but twice a week training for  <br>00:28:21.240 the same muscle gives you notably better  <br>00:28:24.799 results training three times a week  <br>00:28:27.559 versus twice tce training four times a  <br>00:28:29.840 week versus three times training five  <br>00:28:31.799 times a week versus four times is uh an  <br>00:28:35.279 an exponentially de-escalating amount of  <br>00:28:37.919 impressive differences so one time a  <br>00:28:40.320 week Works it'll get you results two  <br>00:28:43.320 times a week gets you like one and a  <br>00:28:45.120 half times the results like way better  <br>00:28:47.919 better three times a week is like  <br>00:28:50.399 another little bit more results still  <br>00:28:52.320 notable four times a week is like you  <br>00:28:54.519 got to be training for a while to notice  <br>00:28:56.120 the difference between three and four  <br>00:28:58.080 four and five is contextual and nuanced  <br>00:29:00.000 and I can't actually tell you that  <br>00:29:01.320 categorically 5 days a week is better  <br>00:29:03.080 than four there are some things I would  <br>00:29:04.720 have to know about your plan and  <br>00:29:05.799 everything else to make that conclusion  <br>00:29:07.159 so really I want to be aiming at twice a  <br>00:29:08.559 week per muscle group twice is our  <br>00:29:10.279 minimum two to four times a week is what  <br>00:29:11.880 I say is kind of the best overall  <br>00:29:13.480 recommendation per muscle group and if  <br>00:29:15.799 you train all of your muscles together  <br>00:29:17.519 at the same time a whole body workout  <br>00:29:19.039 which most people in the realm of just  <br>00:29:20.880 I'm busy and I can't train a lot it  <br>00:29:22.640 would be all of the major muscles of  <br>00:29:24.519 your body in the same session twice or  <br>00:29:28.440 three times or four times a week and  <br>00:29:30.039 that is an awesome beginner fitness plan  <br>00:29:32.840 what's going on in my muscles that's  <br>00:29:35.519 encouraging them and making them grow  <br>00:29:37.480 and when are they growing is it when I  <br>00:29:38.720 go to bed at night is it when I do they  <br>00:29:40.559 grow the minute that I curl the the  <br>00:29:42.799 dumbbell what's actually going on  <br>00:29:44.640 because sometimes understanding what's  <br>00:29:45.960 actually going on inside helps me to  <br>00:29:47.519 think through and change my behavior  <br>00:29:50.000 yeah so uh the primary stimulus for  <br>00:29:53.600 muscle growth is there are molecular  <br>00:29:56.320 machines in your muscles in your muscle  <br>00:29:58.919 cells and they are designed to detect  <br>00:30:01.960 the presence of  <br>00:30:04.360 tension and when your muscles generate  <br>00:30:06.559 tension the molecular detector machines  <br>00:30:08.559 go o we got tension here and they start  <br>00:30:11.320 uh saying to other parts of the cells  <br>00:30:13.039 like hey uh let's get this muscle growth  <br>00:30:14.679 thing started started not happening  <br>00:30:16.679 started it's a stimulus of muscle growth  <br>00:30:19.080 there are a couple of other mechanisms  <br>00:30:20.600 which might SL probably have an effect  <br>00:30:24.840 and that a couple of them are metabolite  <br>00:30:26.960 sequestration which is a very fancy way  <br>00:30:28.880 of saying the burn you know at the end  <br>00:30:30.559 of a set you're like ah the metabolites  <br>00:30:33.799 the um byproducts of training if they  <br>00:30:36.480 accumulate to high levels it's been  <br>00:30:37.880 shown in tons of animal studies and a  <br>00:30:40.000 few human studies that like  <br>00:30:41.640 mechanistically they might also tell the  <br>00:30:43.399 molecular Machinery that grows muscle  <br>00:30:45.000 for you again later to uh hey get the  <br>00:30:48.240 muscle growth process another one is the  <br>00:30:49.760 pump so you know you do a couple sets of  <br>00:30:51.399 biceps you're oh my God what's going on  <br>00:30:53.320 here baby flash it at some girl she runs  <br>00:30:55.399 away as usual and the actual cell  <br>00:30:58.440 swelling itself might play a causal  <br>00:31:01.399 mechanistic role in generating more  <br>00:31:03.159 muscle growth but but we know it's  <br>00:31:04.960 probably at least at Le least 80% of the  <br>00:31:07.720 muscle growth anyone will see is because  <br>00:31:09.840 of those receptors for tension muscle  <br>00:31:13.320 growth as soon as you leave the gym is a  <br>00:31:16.200 negative because the gym is catabolic  <br>00:31:18.440 it's a breaks down your muscle actually  <br>00:31:21.120 training breaks down more muscle than it  <br>00:31:23.559 builds however as you go home and you  <br>00:31:26.919 start eating food protein carbs fats and  <br>00:31:30.039 you have several meals per day and  <br>00:31:32.399 you're resting when the food's coming in  <br>00:31:35.120 several hours after training begins if  <br>00:31:37.360 you measure muscle growth consistently  <br>00:31:39.000 which is really difficult to do they  <br>00:31:40.320 don't do it super often you have to keep  <br>00:31:41.960 people in a laboratory you have to do  <br>00:31:43.240 radioactive tracers and measure all this  <br>00:31:45.200 weird  <br>00:31:46.200 stuff every couple of hours they measure  <br>00:31:48.720 the amount of muscle growth that's going  <br>00:31:50.399 on in the biceps goes up and up and up  <br>00:31:52.200 and up and it usually Peaks  <br>00:31:53.840 about half a day to a day and a half  <br>00:31:56.880 after you lift depend depending on how  <br>00:31:58.360 hard you went if it's a pretty easy  <br>00:31:59.679 workout it Peaks a little sooner and  <br>00:32:02.440 Dives and drops off about a day or two  <br>00:32:04.480 later if you train really crazy hard  <br>00:32:07.159 it'll Peak like a day day and a half  <br>00:32:08.679 later and then half a week later it'll  <br>00:32:10.399 drop off back to Baseline levels but  <br>00:32:12.559 it's this really smooth curve and you're  <br>00:32:15.880 growing muscle at every single point  <br>00:32:17.559 under that curve So when you say is it  <br>00:32:19.600 while I'm sleeping is it while I'm  <br>00:32:20.679 eating is it while I'm resting the aners  <br>00:32:22.320 all of those except it's not at the gym  <br>00:32:25.200 you don't grow muscle at the gym you  <br>00:32:26.919 give yourself a signal to grow muscle at  <br>00:32:28.480 the gym and then what you do outside of  <br>00:32:30.039 the gym matters so some people train  <br>00:32:31.320 really hard they don't eat right they  <br>00:32:33.159 don't need enough protein their sleep is  <br>00:32:35.080 total insert bad word here and their  <br>00:32:37.799 stress levels are just totally psychotic  <br>00:32:40.320 they train hard and then week after week  <br>00:32:42.440 after week they're like not seeing any  <br>00:32:44.720 results well the results are actually  <br>00:32:46.440 created when you're resting when you're  <br>00:32:48.480 sleeping when you're eating nutritious  <br>00:32:49.960 food they're stimulated in the workout  <br>00:32:52.880 but that's just phase one phase two the  <br>00:32:54.840 actual growth occurs outside the gym and  <br>00:32:56.720 it occurs not in any any specific time  <br>00:32:58.639 Point like a Magic Window of two hours  <br>00:33:01.279 after the gym like that's when all the  <br>00:33:02.480 growth occurs that's actually when it  <br>00:33:03.840 just starts to go up it's four days  <br>00:33:06.480 afterwards so if you train twice a week  <br>00:33:08.559 you train on Monday you're going a lot  <br>00:33:10.039 of muscle on Monday night Tuesday and  <br>00:33:12.080 Wednesday back uh towards the end of  <br>00:33:14.000 Wednesday you're just not really growing  <br>00:33:15.279 much more muscle you go back to the gym  <br>00:33:17.320 Thursday you hit it hard again you hit  <br>00:33:19.320 that curve up by Sunday you're totally  <br>00:33:21.519 relaxed during Sunday you're not growing  <br>00:33:24.159 any muscle your body's really recovering  <br>00:33:26.039 a lot of that fatigue and then by Monday  <br>00:33:28.159 you're fresh as a pickle and you're  <br>00:33:29.360 ready to go at it again how long will it  <br>00:33:31.600 take me to lose the muscles that I've  <br>00:33:33.320 gained if I don't go back to the gym so  <br>00:33:35.200 again focusing on this bicep I train it  <br>00:33:37.600 I do two times a week I get it nice and  <br>00:33:39.559 big how long before it  <br>00:33:42.559 vanishes great question two-part  <br>00:33:45.919 answer part one  <br>00:33:49.159 is within about two weeks of not  <br>00:33:52.039 training  <br>00:33:53.120 it the first reduction in muscle that is  <br>00:33:57.240 detected by Modern Machinery occurs so  <br>00:34:00.679 if you don't lift for 2 weeks and we put  <br>00:34:03.679 you in an MRI scanner or a dexa scanner  <br>00:34:06.279 let's say a week and a half you don't  <br>00:34:07.440 lift I can't tell you're not really  <br>00:34:10.119 losing any muscle yet you're just going  <br>00:34:11.879 insane and so me personally I'm like  <br>00:34:13.839 addicted to lifting so if I don't lift  <br>00:34:15.159 for a week I'm like oh my God oh my God  <br>00:34:16.599 all my muscle's gone there is some kind  <br>00:34:18.760 of intuitive truth to that because when  <br>00:34:21.040 you don't stress your muscles they when  <br>00:34:23.440 you do stress your muscles they get a  <br>00:34:25.280 little bit inflamed and they bulge up a  <br>00:34:27.399 little bit B so when you're not training  <br>00:34:29.440 for half a week to a week your muscles  <br>00:34:32.560 look smaller like they've lost weight  <br>00:34:34.280 but it's really just all water that they  <br>00:34:35.560 lost you do one gym session thinking  <br>00:34:38.399 like oh my God my biceps are gone a week  <br>00:34:40.000 and a half later you do one session at  <br>00:34:42.079 the end of that you flex and you're like  <br>00:34:43.320 oh my God I'm the biggest I've ever been  <br>00:34:45.159 I was just delusional that whole time CU  <br>00:34:47.079 that stuff comes back super quick after  <br>00:34:49.560 about two weeks of not lifting you start  <br>00:34:51.760 to lose muscle but it happens really  <br>00:34:53.839 really slowly and takes weeks and weeks  <br>00:34:55.918 and weeks and weeks after for several  <br>00:34:58.200 months of not lifting you're going to  <br>00:34:59.920 look considerably smaller in your biceps  <br>00:35:02.839 but probably not as small as when you  <br>00:35:04.960 started lifting because your muscles  <br>00:35:06.960 have a certain memory if we can call it  <br>00:35:08.920 that is that true that thing oh yeah and  <br>00:35:12.200 so a lot of times when you gain an  <br>00:35:13.760 initial amount of muscle especially if  <br>00:35:15.280 you've been at it for years it just  <br>00:35:17.359 never goes back to the same size as when  <br>00:35:19.079 you started it's just always going to be  <br>00:35:20.920 bigger until you reach your 80s or  <br>00:35:22.960 something like that that being said yes  <br>00:35:26.599 you will notice reductions size so two  <br>00:35:28.440 weeks is the direct answer there and  <br>00:35:30.599 it's going to take weeks and weeks and  <br>00:35:31.960 months and months to recede however  <br>00:35:33.520 here's part two and this is awesome news  <br>00:35:36.480 because of that muscle memory  <br>00:35:38.720 situation however long it took you to  <br>00:35:41.079 gain the muscles  <br>00:35:42.839 initially it's going to take you an  <br>00:35:45.839 order of magnitude a factor of 10ish or  <br>00:35:48.760 so less time to get it back if you've  <br>00:35:51.960 been more jacked before if you've had  <br>00:35:53.880 bigger muscles they come back to their  <br>00:35:56.680 old size  <br>00:35:58.160 if it took if you you you lifted for  <br>00:36:00.240 eight months you got a bigger bicep and  <br>00:36:03.119 you stopped Lifting for three months and  <br>00:36:04.520 it looks about the same as when you  <br>00:36:06.000 started if you're really careful like  <br>00:36:07.200 okay it's a little bit bigger but really  <br>00:36:08.440 it's just back to square one most people  <br>00:36:10.560 think oh my God another eight months  <br>00:36:13.480 just to get back to where I started like  <br>00:36:15.079 forget the gym the truth is after  <br>00:36:18.000 roughly about a month maybe as little as  <br>00:36:20.599 3 weeks you're going to have the same  <br>00:36:22.240 size biceps that you did in your Peak  <br>00:36:24.400 because the degree to which your tissue  <br>00:36:26.920 grows if it's been a certain size before  <br>00:36:29.079 especially if it was notably bigger than  <br>00:36:31.760 normal and you held that around for a  <br>00:36:33.720 few months and a few years it comes back  <br>00:36:37.160 in a way that is so fast If you  <br>00:36:39.680 experience If you experience it yourself  <br>00:36:42.160 it's it's like you don't believe that  <br>00:36:44.000 it's happening to you you they been able  <br>00:36:46.240 to like scientifically test this oh yeah  <br>00:36:48.319 all the time yeah retraining studies  <br>00:36:49.839 detraining retraining oh yeah they've  <br>00:36:51.680 they've done studies where they  <br>00:36:52.800 purposefully like lift for a while and  <br>00:36:54.560 they stop Lifting for a long time and  <br>00:36:55.920 they see how long it takes to get back  <br>00:36:57.319 and  <br>00:36:58.160 um there's one study I'm familiar with  <br>00:37:00.440 offand that there's a group of people  <br>00:37:02.640 that trained consistently for multiple  <br>00:37:05.119 weeks and there's another group of  <br>00:37:07.400 people that trained consistently for a  <br>00:37:09.319 few weeks and then took two weeks  <br>00:37:11.200 completely off in the middle and then  <br>00:37:12.880 just started retraining again for a few  <br>00:37:14.359 weeks later both groups had identically  <br>00:37:17.680 sized differences in muscle at the end  <br>00:37:19.680 of the study and so we were like okay so  <br>00:37:21.680 so that group that trained consistently  <br>00:37:23.280 never took two weeks off could we say  <br>00:37:25.839 that they purposefully like dunked two  <br>00:37:28.359 weeks of their time away for nothing  <br>00:37:30.599 uhhuh yeah your body goes right back  <br>00:37:33.839 into regaining old lost muscle so  <br>00:37:36.880 rapidly that this is such great news  <br>00:37:39.960 because look let's say you lifted  <br>00:37:41.839 consistently most of the Year holiday  <br>00:37:43.880 season comes up Winter  <br>00:37:45.520 holidays you're not going to the gym as  <br>00:37:47.920 much maybe not at all three weeks later  <br>00:37:50.240 of no gym you look at yourself you look  <br>00:37:52.040 a little small or kind of deflated and  <br>00:37:53.560 you're like oh my God I'm going to have  <br>00:37:55.760 to restart all this from scrap  <br>00:37:58.079 nope two weeks later you're in the best  <br>00:38:00.640 shape of your life again if you left the  <br>00:38:02.720 gym for 6 months one or two months later  <br>00:38:05.680 you're in the best shape of your life  <br>00:38:06.920 again that's how rapidly it comes back  <br>00:38:08.720 so it's really good news for anyone who  <br>00:38:09.960 hasn't been in the gym and is feeling  <br>00:38:11.119 guilty about it go back get consistent  <br>00:38:13.280 again you're just going to Skyrocket  <br>00:38:15.839 that is very exciting because yeah we  <br>00:38:17.880 always have sometimes it's the trough  <br>00:38:19.960 the the couple of weeks off that makes  <br>00:38:21.480 us demotivated cuz that's crossed my  <br>00:38:23.400 mind before Oh my God that took me three  <br>00:38:24.839 months to get there and it's going to  <br>00:38:26.599 take me another 3 months to get back but  <br>00:38:28.920 what about so if I'm training that bicep  <br>00:38:31.240 how have I got to think about stretching  <br>00:38:33.560 and warming up before I start before I  <br>00:38:36.040 get going with my training there are  <br>00:38:38.079 many ways to do it but uh there's some  <br>00:38:41.040 research on this recently  <br>00:38:43.000 actually you don't need much one of the  <br>00:38:46.560 simplest ways to warm up that we  <br>00:38:48.520 recommended RP and our app has it in the  <br>00:38:50.760 in the  <br>00:38:52.280 instructions you want let's say you have  <br>00:38:54.480 your final weight already picked out  <br>00:38:56.640 like last week did 20 lb dumbbells for  <br>00:38:59.680 sets of 15 this week it's sets of 16  <br>00:39:02.240 with the 20 lb dumbbells what you want  <br>00:39:04.359 to do is you want to do very lightweight  <br>00:39:08.680 maybe the 5B dumbbells for a set of 12  <br>00:39:12.079 just to get everything moving and  <br>00:39:13.160 grooving good technique same technique  <br>00:39:14.599 you're going to  <br>00:39:15.640 use 30 seconds of rest a minute of rest  <br>00:39:19.359 you pick up  <br>00:39:21.880 the 10 or 15 PB dumbbells you do a set  <br>00:39:25.000 of eight reps there a little bit more  <br>00:39:26.640 challenging your feel your grooove a  <br>00:39:28.040 little bit but your body is already more  <br>00:39:29.240 warm your nervous system is more active  <br>00:39:30.800 your muscles are more  <br>00:39:32.319 pliable you rest a minute after that and  <br>00:39:36.119 then you'll pick up the weight you're  <br>00:39:37.400 actually using the 20 Pounders and  <br>00:39:39.800 you'll do a set of two to four reps with  <br>00:39:41.599 them just to get the feel of that heavy  <br>00:39:43.520 weight that you're going to be doing to  <br>00:39:44.880 climatize not just your muscles and your  <br>00:39:46.839 nervous system but your psychology to  <br>00:39:48.359 like okay this is this is the business  <br>00:39:49.640 weight that I'm going to be using so 12  <br>00:39:52.560 84 rest another 30 seconds first working  <br>00:39:56.040 set of whatever 6 reps you're up when  <br>00:40:00.079 you have multiple exercises for the same  <br>00:40:01.800 muscle group you just need to do one set  <br>00:40:04.560 of like four to eight reps in that  <br>00:40:07.240 middle weight range between zero and  <br>00:40:09.200 whatever you're going to do just to get  <br>00:40:10.800 the feel of the exercise because you're  <br>00:40:12.079 already generally warm in that area one  <br>00:40:14.520 little warmup set rest uh you know 30  <br>00:40:16.720 seconds to a minute and then hit your  <br>00:40:18.000 first set if you're switching which  <br>00:40:20.319 muscles you're using like you were  <br>00:40:21.520 training chest but then in the same  <br>00:40:22.839 session you started training back that  <br>00:40:24.880 first back exercise 1284 the weight goes  <br>00:40:28.079 up up up the Reps go down down down just  <br>00:40:30.200 a little bit of time between and then  <br>00:40:31.800 you hit your first work set you're good  <br>00:40:32.960 to go you don't have to do cardio before  <br>00:40:35.280 you don't have to get on the treadmill  <br>00:40:36.319 you can if you like it you don't have to  <br>00:40:38.079 do some kind of cardio warm-up you don't  <br>00:40:40.000 have to do any kind of stretching or  <br>00:40:41.280 anything like that you don't have to do  <br>00:40:42.560 any kind of weird bosu ball band around  <br>00:40:44.440 your neck crazy potentiation exercises  <br>00:40:47.119 just that little ramp up is basically  <br>00:40:50.119 98% of all cases exactly and only what  <br>00:40:52.760 you need to do what is a warm-up what is  <br>00:40:55.119 going on physiologically inside my  <br>00:40:56.640 muscle cuz we we all just warm up and I  <br>00:40:58.640 don't think anybody actually knows what  <br>00:41:00.000 what's going on yeah so your muscle  <br>00:41:04.079 tissues um they have uh they have  <br>00:41:08.440 physical qualities that can be measured  <br>00:41:10.200 almost in like a fluid dynamics terms  <br>00:41:12.119 like viscosity and hysteresis and all  <br>00:41:14.560 that stuff and so when you're very cold  <br>00:41:19.920 a lot of times the uh there's kind of a  <br>00:41:23.200 Frailty implied there as you're warming  <br>00:41:26.359 up you're sending blood to around the  <br>00:41:28.920 muscle the muscle itself is literally  <br>00:41:30.920 becoming warmer and a lot of those kind  <br>00:41:34.200 of tight structures that are uh they  <br>00:41:36.800 proteins that are made of kind of a  <br>00:41:38.040 stretchy material they loosen up a  <br>00:41:39.680 little bit and that allows you to go  <br>00:41:43.880 through that full range of motion and  <br>00:41:45.079 training and not actually get hurt and  <br>00:41:48.520 that's from the muscle perspective you  <br>00:41:50.720 also get some kind of chemical stuff  <br>00:41:52.280 that happens and certain structures fill  <br>00:41:53.839 up with chemicals certain structures  <br>00:41:55.480 chemicals go down and that gets you  <br>00:41:56.880 ready to perform super hard work but  <br>00:41:59.960 that's part of the story the other part  <br>00:42:01.160 is the nervous system because your  <br>00:42:03.440 nervous system is also getting warmed up  <br>00:42:05.200 and in technical terms it's called  <br>00:42:07.280 potentiation when you just show up to  <br>00:42:10.359 the gym and you let's say we said look  <br>00:42:13.359 okay we re-engineered your tendons when  <br>00:42:15.000 you were asleep you're not going to get  <br>00:42:16.720 hurt it's impossible for you to get hurt  <br>00:42:18.079 like a car would have to hit you for you  <br>00:42:19.280 to rip your bicep off you can just go  <br>00:42:21.520 and just hit the curls right away you  <br>00:42:23.680 wouldn't get hurt but it would feel  <br>00:42:25.480 really strange and you wouldn't get four  <br>00:42:27.680 or five reps close to where you're  <br>00:42:29.440 supposed to be from last week because  <br>00:42:31.319 your nervous system was like what hell  <br>00:42:33.559 is going on I'm supposed to be doing  <br>00:42:35.359 something so you need warm up the  <br>00:42:36.319 nervous system a part of that is  <br>00:42:38.119 literally like the actual nervous system  <br>00:42:39.800 itself down to the C Level is Flushing  <br>00:42:42.280 all kinds of metabolites through the  <br>00:42:43.680 connections are getting stronger you're  <br>00:42:45.920 uh sort of doing a little bit of kind of  <br>00:42:47.319 mini rewiring of primary motor cortex to  <br>00:42:50.200 say go oh we're doing curls this is how  <br>00:42:52.599 you execute this pattern another part is  <br>00:42:55.119 technical like oh this is the technique  <br>00:42:57.480 I'm going to do because if you just get  <br>00:42:58.960 in the muscle and just do stuff like  <br>00:43:00.920 imagine if I told you like hey here's a  <br>00:43:02.280 ball just like go go shoot some hoops  <br>00:43:04.040 just hit that you know three-pointer  <br>00:43:05.640 shot you're  <br>00:43:06.720 like I need a couple shots to remind my  <br>00:43:09.880 body of what it's like to shoot the  <br>00:43:11.720 basketball same idea for lifting you to  <br>00:43:13.880 remind your body of what a curl motion  <br>00:43:15.640 is and if you remind it a couple sets in  <br>00:43:17.520 a row by the time you hit that real  <br>00:43:19.400 working set that fourth set your body's  <br>00:43:21.559 like I know exactly what I'm going to do  <br>00:43:24.160 which parts of the muscle I'm going to  <br>00:43:26.119 activate to contract which other parts  <br>00:43:28.079 of other muscles am going to activate to  <br>00:43:29.680 relax and co-contract to make this whole  <br>00:43:31.680 thing happen what are the the other sort  <br>00:43:33.800 of common mistakes people make when they  <br>00:43:35.920 they go to the gym or they start  <br>00:43:36.960 training or they start exercising so  <br>00:43:38.839 there I've I've kind of ticked off not  <br>00:43:41.240 stretching and taking on a heavy load  <br>00:43:43.960 too quickly um but also ramping up  <br>00:43:46.920 volumes and loads too fast so that sort  <br>00:43:49.200 of over strained before my body is ready  <br>00:43:50.920 for it are there any really other sort  <br>00:43:52.960 of common obvious mistakes people make  <br>00:43:55.200 that inhibit their progress  <br>00:43:58.240 one of them is a failure to pay  <br>00:44:00.839 attention to good technique okay there  <br>00:44:04.040 are sort of some Universal principles of  <br>00:44:05.880 what is good technique in the gym for  <br>00:44:07.359 muscle  <br>00:44:08.280 growth one of them is are you moving in  <br>00:44:11.720 a way that properly activates stimulates  <br>00:44:14.880 that muscle to actually get it to grow  <br>00:44:17.800 because if you do a curl that arcs up it  <br>00:44:22.040 does a lot of bicep if you do a curl  <br>00:44:24.280 that arcs back this way because the  <br>00:44:26.440 bicep is being pulled one way and pulled  <br>00:44:28.839 the other way at the shoulder and the  <br>00:44:30.720 elbow it ends up doing more of um  <br>00:44:33.480 stabilizing contraction than actually  <br>00:44:35.760 being the prime mover for the movement  <br>00:44:37.960 so when you see people curling at the  <br>00:44:39.240 gym and they're just kind of doing this  <br>00:44:40.400 you're like yes that is training your  <br>00:44:43.119 biceps but if you just moved a little  <br>00:44:45.839 bit differently it would be so so much  <br>00:44:47.400 better here's another example squatting  <br>00:44:49.319 right for your legs if you squat really  <br>00:44:52.760 far back and not so far down like you're  <br>00:44:57.040 your glutes get hit okay your lower back  <br>00:44:59.280 and upper and midback is going to get  <br>00:45:00.920 hit a lot but because there's not a huge  <br>00:45:03.559 change in your knee angle you're not  <br>00:45:06.119 getting a ton of quad stimulus if you  <br>00:45:08.160 stay more upright and your heels and  <br>00:45:10.880 toes are on the ground and you allow  <br>00:45:13.240 your knees to go Way Forward beyond your  <br>00:45:15.880 toes as you stay upright and sink down  <br>00:45:18.520 really low so that your knee goes into  <br>00:45:19.960 one of these oh my God it's all quads  <br>00:45:23.000 all day long so you want technique that  <br>00:45:25.520 is targeting the muscle it's very  <br>00:45:27.720 similar rep to rep to rep and it puts  <br>00:45:30.400 the muscle consistently through a range  <br>00:45:32.720 of motion that is in that deep painful  <br>00:45:35.640 uh length and stretch position if you  <br>00:45:37.760 just have all those three everything  <br>00:45:39.480 else we can say about your Technique is  <br>00:45:41.079 just nuances and finer points those are  <br>00:45:43.079 really the big ones we talked about  <br>00:45:45.000 nutrition earlier as well so if I want  <br>00:45:46.920 to make my bicep grow and also drop off  <br>00:45:50.720 the weight around the bicep so you can  <br>00:45:52.520 see see it even more what should I be  <br>00:45:54.440 putting into my  <br>00:45:55.599 mouth the number one requisite for  <br>00:45:58.160 muscle growth is  <br>00:46:00.160 protein foods with lots of protein in  <br>00:46:04.079 them ideally should be consumed three to  <br>00:46:07.400 five times per day at roughly  <br>00:46:09.640 equidistant intervals breakfast lunch  <br>00:46:12.319 dinner totally fine even better  <br>00:46:14.440 breakfast lunch dinner evening  <br>00:46:17.000 snack the average person  <br>00:46:20.240 needs a little bit less than let's say a  <br>00:46:24.359 gram per pound of body weight per day of  <br>00:46:26.480 protein actually considerably less  <br>00:46:28.559 that's kind of the top limit and a cool  <br>00:46:30.559 aspirational thing to shoot for so if  <br>00:46:33.720 you weigh let's say 200 lb you should be  <br>00:46:37.200 consuming something like 150 to 200  <br>00:46:39.599 grams of protein per day and 150 for  <br>00:46:41.640 almost everyone's totally enough but if  <br>00:46:43.520 you're real serious and hardcore and  <br>00:46:45.119 just want that insurance policy 200  <br>00:46:46.680 grams of protein per day so then if  <br>00:46:48.680 you're eating four times a day that's oh  <br>00:46:51.160 yeah 30 40 let's say 40 to 50 grams of  <br>00:46:55.200 protein per meal can I eat too much  <br>00:46:57.800 protein and and then it becomes fat or  <br>00:47:00.359 something uh that's uh so protein by  <br>00:47:03.319 itself no if your protein is so high  <br>00:47:06.040 that your carbs and fats are the same  <br>00:47:08.160 and you jack up your protein super high  <br>00:47:09.720 but your carbs and fats stay where they  <br>00:47:11.440 are your calories become excessive that  <br>00:47:14.040 will cause fing over time but if you're  <br>00:47:16.119 doing a diet where you take a ton of  <br>00:47:17.640 protein but you dropped your carbs and  <br>00:47:19.119 fats and your calories are at  <br>00:47:20.559 maintenance levels you're not going to  <br>00:47:21.880 gain any fat it's not bad for your  <br>00:47:23.839 kidneys it's not bad for any other part  <br>00:47:25.520 of your body excessive protein as a  <br>00:47:28.559 health malady has been a myth the entire  <br>00:47:31.000 time and that's one of those um Notions  <br>00:47:33.280 that people carry with them that too  <br>00:47:35.000 much protein is bad right like yes if  <br>00:47:36.559 you've had kidney surgery absolutely  <br>00:47:38.359 short of that you're probably good to go  <br>00:47:40.640 you'll fart a lot and people will hate  <br>00:47:42.119 you but you know you mentioned three to  <br>00:47:44.800 five meals a  <br>00:47:46.040 day a lot of people are now in this Camp  <br>00:47:48.760 of of fasting an intermittent fasting  <br>00:47:51.720 and not eating often is it possible to  <br>00:47:53.839 fast but also to gain muscle mass in the  <br>00:47:56.200 way that you've described yeah totally  <br>00:47:58.000 it just won't happen at as an impressive  <br>00:47:59.920 rate so you have to make a trade-off for  <br>00:48:01.599 yourself if you want you know most  <br>00:48:03.839 jacked Steven that you can be three to  <br>00:48:05.720 five meals a day consistently spread in  <br>00:48:07.880 almost to an  <br>00:48:09.839 individual competitive bodybuilders eat  <br>00:48:13.720 that frequently and eat high protein how  <br>00:48:16.160 often did you eat uh I eat five five  <br>00:48:18.599 times a day four or five times a day  <br>00:48:20.079 usually and do you eat before or after  <br>00:48:22.040 you train both okay so before you train  <br>00:48:24.720 and after you train do you different  <br>00:48:26.160 things a times I'll train early in the  <br>00:48:27.920 morning and so I won't train at I won't  <br>00:48:29.640 eat at all I'll wake up and I'll have  <br>00:48:31.559 like a protein and carb mix shake with  <br>00:48:33.400 my training totally optional super extra  <br>00:48:36.079 credit may not do anything at all if you  <br>00:48:38.200 look at the literature but I find it a  <br>00:48:40.000 little bit compelling to do a little bit  <br>00:48:41.240 of that and then afterwards I have my  <br>00:48:43.200 first post-workout meal second meal  <br>00:48:45.119 third meal fourth meal bedtime wake up  <br>00:48:47.040 do it again what you take to get you  <br>00:48:49.280 going do you do pre-workout no why no uh  <br>00:48:51.920 I don't do any stimulants of any kind  <br>00:48:54.040 why uh I'm just kind of coked up all the  <br>00:48:56.960 time naturally so like if you give me  <br>00:48:59.280 stimulants it's just going to go into  <br>00:49:01.040 the not so pleasant side of side effects  <br>00:49:03.319 like I'm just going to be like this and  <br>00:49:04.960 way too amped up super high anxiety and  <br>00:49:07.640 my thoughts get to be like I have less  <br>00:49:09.440 fluidity of thinking and stuff so I just  <br>00:49:11.799 it just a lot of me I guess and so when  <br>00:49:14.079 I wake up in the morning I don't need  <br>00:49:15.520 anything to get me going I just go and a  <br>00:49:17.680 couple warm-up sets later I have all the  <br>00:49:19.319 energy I need that's not everyone and so  <br>00:49:22.559 some green tea some black coffee or some  <br>00:49:24.920 pre-workout 30 minutes before the the  <br>00:49:26.880 gym is great advice for a ton of people  <br>00:49:28.839 I feel like pre-workout can't be healthy  <br>00:49:30.799 if you're doing it five six seven times  <br>00:49:32.799 a week because some of that stuff is so  <br>00:49:34.799 unbelievably strong like I've had it  <br>00:49:36.720 before I've got literally like heart  <br>00:49:37.839 palpitations when I've had a pre-workout  <br>00:49:39.400 and you know you talk about anxiety that  <br>00:49:41.200 anxious feeling it can't be it can't be  <br>00:49:43.640 help healthy for people to be doing that  <br>00:49:46.200 frequently it seems to be quite fine it  <br>00:49:49.079 seems to be quite fine now at the  <br>00:49:50.839 extremes and in for some individuals  <br>00:49:53.440 it's not ideal but um the upper limit  <br>00:49:57.400 dose of caffeine in milligrams per day  <br>00:50:01.520 at which we can confidently say most  <br>00:50:03.400 people will experience the beginnings of  <br>00:50:06.000 Health  <br>00:50:07.000 maladies is a th000  <br>00:50:09.760 milligrams and a cup of coffee has  <br>00:50:12.440 depending on which cup 50 to 100 now  <br>00:50:15.440 some pre-workouts have 250 gr milligrams  <br>00:50:18.799 of caffeine some have  <br>00:50:21.160 500 uh last I checked Ronnie Coleman's  <br>00:50:24.280 pre-workout has 550 migs of caffeine per  <br>00:50:27.720 scoop or per serving and so that's kind  <br>00:50:30.119 of a lot uh I if I took 550 migs of  <br>00:50:33.640 caffeine you don't take me to the gym  <br>00:50:35.720 just take me right to the hospital put  <br>00:50:37.400 me in the psychiatric word 36 hours  <br>00:50:39.440 later I'll be okay but for some people  <br>00:50:41.799 to get so accustomed to high doses of  <br>00:50:43.440 caffeine that is supposed not unhealthy  <br>00:50:45.240 for them to consume and also uh they  <br>00:50:47.760 feel quite fine so I would say start  <br>00:50:49.599 with as little as you need to get you  <br>00:50:51.160 going and if you need to tight trate and  <br>00:50:52.640 work up from there that's a good thing  <br>00:50:54.760 the other thing I would say is I would  <br>00:50:57.200 have a compelling case for pre-workout  <br>00:50:59.559 or stimulant if I ask you like hey how  <br>00:51:02.400 much energy do you typically have at the  <br>00:51:03.640 gym you're like well that's super great  <br>00:51:05.599 and they're like should I take  <br>00:51:06.520 pre-workout I'd be like no there's no  <br>00:51:08.240 compelling case for that at all if  <br>00:51:09.920 you're like look I wake up in the  <br>00:51:10.839 morning some days I just don't get a ton  <br>00:51:12.599 of sleep and I need something to get me  <br>00:51:14.920 going not every day but sometimes I'll  <br>00:51:16.799 be like hey look consider green tea  <br>00:51:19.680 black coffee some diet soda or all the  <br>00:51:22.920 way up to pre-workout if you need it but  <br>00:51:25.440 some people take it kind of a like um a  <br>00:51:28.319 like a religious thing as a habit uh as  <br>00:51:31.160 a ritual and it's like dude you're  <br>00:51:33.240 training your forms and biceps for 20  <br>00:51:36.000 minutes total at 900 p.m. you do not  <br>00:51:38.599 need three scoops of pre-workout for  <br>00:51:40.440 that I don't even know where it's going  <br>00:51:42.000 at that point so some people get a  <br>00:51:43.280 little crazy with the pre-workouts at  <br>00:51:44.839 the end of the world it's at at best  <br>00:51:48.839 needless what's your stance on the whole  <br>00:51:50.960 idea of calories in calories out a lot  <br>00:51:53.359 of people just focus on that as their  <br>00:51:55.520 their sort of their script to lose body  <br>00:51:59.359 weight lose body fat and gain muscle is  <br>00:52:02.640 is that a useful frame to to use and why  <br>00:52:05.839 do so many people fail at it if if it is  <br>00:52:08.319 a useful frame most people fail at it  <br>00:52:11.240 because they don't consider both the  <br>00:52:13.440 calories in and calories outside of the  <br>00:52:16.559 equation and a lot of people fail  <br>00:52:18.920 because they're very bad at estimating  <br>00:52:20.680 food amounts and calories they someone  <br>00:52:23.359 will say like a tablespoon of peanut  <br>00:52:25.000 butter Stephen if you ever actually seen  <br>00:52:27.119 a tablespoon measuring cup it does not  <br>00:52:30.200 look like Mom's tablespoon where she  <br>00:52:32.119 takes the peanut butter and goes that's  <br>00:52:34.640 like four tablespoons and so like but  <br>00:52:36.720 I'm eating the calories blah blah blah  <br>00:52:39.599 every time you take people into what's  <br>00:52:41.319 called a metabolic Ward which is a study  <br>00:52:44.040 center where you're not allowed to have  <br>00:52:45.880 visitors that bring you food the workers  <br>00:52:48.240 only give you the food that you need and  <br>00:52:49.760 all of your exercise and your output is  <br>00:52:51.720 controlled and monitored and so is your  <br>00:52:53.359 intake no one has ever violated laws of  <br>00:52:55.960 thermodynamic we give you a certain  <br>00:52:57.440 number of calories and we expect you to  <br>00:52:58.760 lose a certain number of weight there's  <br>00:52:59.799 a variance about that but it you're  <br>00:53:02.720 going to lose the weight that roughly we  <br>00:53:04.520 predict if we account for all variables  <br>00:53:05.880 you're going to lose almost exactly the  <br>00:53:07.040 weight that we predict so calories in  <br>00:53:08.240 calories out is incontrovertible in  <br>00:53:10.599 among 90s something per 98% of people  <br>00:53:15.000 who do research in the field and are  <br>00:53:16.359 scientifically literate and educated  <br>00:53:18.160 calories in calories out is not  <br>00:53:19.640 controversial it never has been there  <br>00:53:21.559 are some people who say well calorie  <br>00:53:24.400 counting didn't work for me that's  <br>00:53:26.920 probably because you did it wrong or you  <br>00:53:29.000 weren't even concerned about how much  <br>00:53:30.400 protein you're taking in or how many  <br>00:53:31.640 carbs or how many fats there are other  <br>00:53:33.040 details that matter like if you say I  <br>00:53:36.880 need a V8 engine in a car that's all  <br>00:53:38.760 that matters like okay well there's no  <br>00:53:40.240 steering wheel there's no pedals cool  <br>00:53:42.160 well okay I need those things too so  <br>00:53:44.200 calories and calories out is the very  <br>00:53:45.839 core because without an engine you're  <br>00:53:46.920 not going anywhere but what types of  <br>00:53:50.119 foods you're eating matters a little bit  <br>00:53:52.200 are you getting enough protein carbs  <br>00:53:53.480 fats that matters a bit too so people  <br>00:53:55.319 like to just bash calorie balance and  <br>00:53:58.040 calories in calories out is well it's  <br>00:53:59.559 it's totally myth it doesn't work no no  <br>00:54:01.000 it works great it's just not always  <br>00:54:03.400 enough to get you in the best shape you  <br>00:54:04.760 can but if you do it right as far as net  <br>00:54:07.400 balance weight gain or weight loss  <br>00:54:09.720 calories in calories out is actually the  <br>00:54:11.520 only thing that matters tissue wise is  <br>00:54:14.760 that gain mostly muscle or mostly fat is  <br>00:54:17.160 the loss mostly muscle or mostly fat  <br>00:54:19.079 that has not so much to do with calories  <br>00:54:20.760 it has much more to do with proteins  <br>00:54:22.799 carbs fats the quality of food you're  <br>00:54:24.680 eating nutrient timing and all the rest  <br>00:54:26.440 of it so calories and calories out is  <br>00:54:27.680 amazing super explanatory critical but  <br>00:54:30.359 it's just not the whole picture and  <br>00:54:32.319 that's really it I guess because so many  <br>00:54:33.680 people say they've heard about calories  <br>00:54:35.319 and calories out but they fail at  <br>00:54:38.480 maintaining it now that's really about  <br>00:54:40.599 motivation and the psychology of doing  <br>00:54:42.200 such a thing um some people have said to  <br>00:54:44.079 me that our bodies want to defend our  <br>00:54:45.559 weight so if we start eating less we'll  <br>00:54:47.720 become a little bit more hungry if we go  <br>00:54:49.040 for a run after the run or after  <br>00:54:51.119 physical exertion our body will try and  <br>00:54:52.760 make up for it because it's programmed  <br>00:54:54.079 to try and defend its weight because its  <br>00:54:55.960 weight cor relates to our ability to  <br>00:54:58.520 survive  <br>00:55:00.119 um why do people fail at it one of the  <br>00:55:02.680 reasons you said is because you know  <br>00:55:04.160 that they're not actually measuring the  <br>00:55:05.440 calories correctly but the psychological  <br>00:55:07.480 reasons that it isn't hasn't worked for  <br>00:55:10.000 some people can you think of many  <br>00:55:12.359 because when I when people talk about  <br>00:55:13.440 calories in calories out if you look at  <br>00:55:15.000 the comment sections on those videos  <br>00:55:16.240 people say I've tried this and it didn't  <br>00:55:17.319 work okay so first of all I typically  <br>00:55:20.160 don't look at comment sections of videos  <br>00:55:21.760 because comment section is not  <br>00:55:23.520 representative of the population it's  <br>00:55:25.720 not represent reprentative of the people  <br>00:55:27.480 that watch your videos it's not  <br>00:55:28.799 representative of the hardcore  <br>00:55:30.000 demographic that watches your videos so  <br>00:55:32.640 just as a statistical artifact every  <br>00:55:35.000 single Claim by people against calorie  <br>00:55:37.520 balance in that comment section could be  <br>00:55:40.000 true for them but they represent 1% of  <br>00:55:42.599 the population so 99% of people at works  <br>00:55:44.920 just fine for 1% they get into some kind  <br>00:55:47.119 of trouble usually that trouble is they  <br>00:55:49.440 didn't count calories properly they  <br>00:55:51.480 didn't account for macronutrient profile  <br>00:55:53.280 proteins carbs fats they didn't account  <br>00:55:54.680 for nutrient timing or the kinds of food  <br>00:55:56.480 that they're they're doing and so on and  <br>00:55:57.680 so forth and another one is like you  <br>00:56:00.559 said  <br>00:56:01.799 sustainability how long do I have to  <br>00:56:04.200 count calories for in my life for me to  <br>00:56:06.920 get the body that I want and keep it is  <br>00:56:08.799 sure [ __ ] not going to be forever so  <br>00:56:10.520 what I'll do is I'll count calories for  <br>00:56:11.880 a few months I'll lose a lot of weight  <br>00:56:13.400 then I'll go back to eating on Vibes and  <br>00:56:14.960 the weight comes right back absolutely  <br>00:56:17.039 so better than just counting calories  <br>00:56:19.559 what we want to do is instill people  <br>00:56:21.200 with good eating habits if you learn how  <br>00:56:23.400 to construct meals made of lean proteins  <br>00:56:25.760 veggies fruits whole grains healthy fats  <br>00:56:28.200 you know roughly how to see how much  <br>00:56:30.000 food you need and how much food looks at  <br>00:56:32.039 least like it's what you eat per day if  <br>00:56:33.839 you're checking your body weight  <br>00:56:35.000 relatively often and when your body  <br>00:56:37.039 weight starts to get a little higher you  <br>00:56:38.319 kind of clean up your diet a little bit  <br>00:56:40.039 uh and when your body weight's nice and  <br>00:56:41.240 low you couple cheat meals couple kebabs  <br>00:56:43.680 you know burgers and stuff that's all  <br>00:56:45.359 good if you do that and you have those  <br>00:56:46.640 healthy habits whatever weight you lost  <br>00:56:48.400 on calorie restriction you can maintain  <br>00:56:50.920 with very very little work not counting  <br>00:56:53.839 a damn thing just on good habits but but  <br>00:56:56.799 if you counted calories you do some  <br>00:56:58.559 weird diet where you only eat like too  <br>00:57:00.200 with orange slices and protein shakes or  <br>00:57:02.280 something yeah the calorie counting will  <br>00:57:04.319 get you wherever you need to go but then  <br>00:57:06.160 afterwards like the diet's over and  <br>00:57:07.480 you're like now what do I do like uh  <br>00:57:10.200 good luck going out in the world and  <br>00:57:11.799 feating the same diet that got you fat  <br>00:57:13.559 in the first place that's the big kicker  <br>00:57:15.880 people might say it takes too much time  <br>00:57:17.880 to count calories it leads to a an  <br>00:57:20.599 unhealthy relationship with food I think  <br>00:57:22.640 there's a big movement at the moment to  <br>00:57:23.799 trying to get calories off menus because  <br>00:57:25.839 it's said to increase the amount of  <br>00:57:27.799 people that have eating disorders and  <br>00:57:28.920 things like  <br>00:57:30.799 that is that a a conversation worth  <br>00:57:34.799 entertaining in this in this regard sure  <br>00:57:36.839 sure very few people will develop Eating  <br>00:57:40.880 Disorders based on increases in  <br>00:57:43.079 information they are presented I would  <br>00:57:45.559 actually call that eating order instead  <br>00:57:47.039 of eating  <br>00:57:48.400 disorder most people who get Eating  <br>00:57:50.440 Disorders are highly at risk genetically  <br>00:57:53.119 and with a few other social  <br>00:57:55.000 circumstances  <br>00:57:57.280 Eating Disorders are uh for example the  <br>00:58:00.799 most uh deleterious Eating Disorders  <br>00:58:04.039 anorexia  <br>00:58:05.640 nervosa seen not exclusively but almost  <br>00:58:09.559 exclusively in females of reproductive  <br>00:58:12.000 age they ain't calories on a menu doing  <br>00:58:14.839 that that's something you bring into the  <br>00:58:17.359 table usually because you have the  <br>00:58:19.440 genetic proclivity for it and  <br>00:58:21.880 additionally because you've been in a  <br>00:58:24.119 social and cultural circumstance where  <br>00:58:27.079 not only were you the wrong person to  <br>00:58:28.920 get ridiculed for your weight but also a  <br>00:58:31.839 lot of people ridiculed you for your  <br>00:58:33.319 weight and then you go all careening off  <br>00:58:35.839 on this path where no one can even tell  <br>00:58:37.520 you're super skinny anymore because you  <br>00:58:38.760 don't believe it so the idea that uh  <br>00:58:42.200 you're going to see much higher  <br>00:58:43.200 prevalence globally in Eating Disorders  <br>00:58:44.839 from putting menu calorie labels on  <br>00:58:46.680 things is true by this much at the  <br>00:58:49.400 margins and it's just largely not the  <br>00:58:51.839 case adjacent to that is this idea of  <br>00:58:54.160 muscle dysmorphia which affects  <br>00:58:56.599 a lot of people but specifically men  <br>00:58:58.839 roughly 87% of men that are between 15  <br>00:59:01.960 to 32 years old that experience muscle  <br>00:59:05.200 dysmorphia which is what so muscle  <br>00:59:08.920 dysmorphia generally is for whatever  <br>00:59:11.799 level of jacked that you are you think  <br>00:59:14.520 you are considerably less jacked both in  <br>00:59:17.720 reference to yourself and your own  <br>00:59:19.359 desires and in reference to an ethereal  <br>00:59:21.920 make belief comparator population in  <br>00:59:23.920 your head so if you were to ask like hey  <br>00:59:26.920 Mike do you feel jacked and I'm like  <br>00:59:29.559 nope you're like oo not good not a good  <br>00:59:31.720 sign clearly he's jacked and then you  <br>00:59:33.640 can ask me Mike compared to other  <br>00:59:35.440 40-year-old ashkanazi Jewish men how  <br>00:59:38.400 Jacked are you and if I'm like I'm  <br>00:59:40.160 probably like bottom 50% for sure  <br>00:59:42.520 probably bottom 25 to' be like okay he's  <br>00:59:44.480 mentally ill take him away that is high  <br>00:59:46.760 level muscle dysmorphia a disassociation  <br>00:59:49.760 from any objective reality about how  <br>00:59:52.520 much muscle you actually have do people  <br>00:59:55.680 over estimate or underestimate their  <br>00:59:57.599 appearance as it relates to their  <br>00:59:59.039 muscles uh dysmorphia is almost always  <br>01:00:01.920 cataloged as an underestimation but but  <br>01:00:04.760 from your experience working with people  <br>01:00:06.119 do people think they're more jacked than  <br>01:00:07.480 they actually are it really depends on  <br>01:00:09.760 the individual most people that are in  <br>01:00:12.160 gym culture that are very invested if  <br>01:00:15.200 you catch them on their not so great  <br>01:00:16.799 days they think they're substantially  <br>01:00:19.440 less jacked than they really are and if  <br>01:00:21.720 you tease it apart via conversation  <br>01:00:23.880 they'll end up being like yeah no no I  <br>01:00:25.160 know I'm jacked but I'm just saying like  <br>01:00:26.880 and then it's aspirational like for my  <br>01:00:28.920 goals I'm not as jacked as I would like  <br>01:00:31.079 to be it's interesting because we  <br>01:00:32.799 typically think of women I think  <br>01:00:35.319 stereotypically in society as caring  <br>01:00:38.160 more about their body image but I've  <br>01:00:41.880 I've read a lot of stats lately that  <br>01:00:43.079 suggest men care equally about their  <br>01:00:44.920 body image but just in slightly  <br>01:00:46.280 different ways and the about the  <br>01:00:47.839 correlation between their perception of  <br>01:00:49.440 their body image and their own mental  <br>01:00:50.720 health and the link between the two sure  <br>01:00:53.640 sure do you see a lot of that do you see  <br>01:00:55.240 this link between Health in male body  <br>01:00:57.160 image yes huge proportion of  <br>01:01:00.799 psychological proclivities are genetic  <br>01:01:03.200 the others are very individually  <br>01:01:05.720 acquired they change through time it's  <br>01:01:07.920 not as easy as saying upbringing or  <br>01:01:09.680 family environment so the one consistent  <br>01:01:12.160 thing about how you relate to the world  <br>01:01:13.760 in your own thoughts is genetics and a  <br>01:01:16.400 lot of the traits tend to aggregate  <br>01:01:18.400 together so it is true to say on a  <br>01:01:21.839 spectrum very nuanced that some people  <br>01:01:25.240 aggregate a lot of negative  <br>01:01:26.799 psychological traits and some people  <br>01:01:28.920 aggregate a lot of positives and there  <br>01:01:30.520 absolutely people everyone's a mixed bag  <br>01:01:32.039 somewhere in between but there's a  <br>01:01:33.119 little bit of this kind of I don't want  <br>01:01:34.960 to use a a term for another mental a  <br>01:01:37.240 bipolarity to the distribution right and  <br>01:01:39.839 so a lot of people that are generally  <br>01:01:42.359 neurotic they feel consistently uh  <br>01:01:45.160 unsafe and unsure of themselves are  <br>01:01:47.440 going to be also the type of people that  <br>01:01:49.160 when they get more jacked through  <br>01:01:50.359 lifting they're still not going to  <br>01:01:51.920 believe that they're as jacked and  <br>01:01:53.400 accomplished and awesome and alpha male  <br>01:01:55.279 as they really are because they're  <br>01:01:56.839 always like you know to use the old  <br>01:01:58.640 Jewish joke stereotype  <br>01:02:00.319 like I'm never going to be big and it's  <br>01:02:02.960 like you're already big like oh I don't  <br>01:02:04.599 know it could get it could get worse  <br>01:02:06.039 tomorrow and a lot of people just bring  <br>01:02:08.680 that to the table and so when you get  <br>01:02:10.799 neurotic people jacked they don't think  <br>01:02:12.520 they're that jacked they're always like  <br>01:02:13.760 oh my God it's always going to end but  <br>01:02:15.440 if you take not neurotic people and make  <br>01:02:17.839 them jacked one week of lifting into  <br>01:02:20.799 those people and they're like dude I'm  <br>01:02:22.079 like do you think I should turn pro in  <br>01:02:23.640 bodybuilding like get out of here you're  <br>01:02:25.119 just overon  <br>01:02:26.480 so it really depends on who's doing the  <br>01:02:28.319 thing now cultural stuff social who's in  <br>01:02:30.920 your circle I'll give you a good example  <br>01:02:33.520 I have a lot of my closest friends have  <br>01:02:36.520 no relation to Fitness whatsoever a  <br>01:02:38.279 bunch of them are actually  <br>01:02:38.920 neuroscientists just randomly people I  <br>01:02:40.880 knew in college that ended up being my  <br>01:02:42.319 friends for life and so when they assess  <br>01:02:45.079 their muscularity relative to myself and  <br>01:02:47.520 my bodybuilder friends they're like I'm  <br>01:02:50.079 in terrible shape and I'm not remotely  <br>01:02:51.599 jacked and they have such a weird  <br>01:02:53.440 comparator population that I always  <br>01:02:55.039 remind them like dude dude not everyone  <br>01:02:56.599 looks like this they go to the store  <br>01:02:57.760 they go to school they go to the bank  <br>01:02:58.720 and they're like oh crap you're right  <br>01:03:00.359 I'm actually the most jacked person at  <br>01:03:01.720 the bank it's just not like Gold's Gym  <br>01:03:03.480 where everyone's enormous so if you  <br>01:03:05.319 happen to be in an environment let's say  <br>01:03:07.400 you're a university student and you go  <br>01:03:08.920 to the University gym and there's lots  <br>01:03:10.559 of jacked people there and you're there  <br>01:03:11.839 all the time trying to do your best you  <br>01:03:13.960 may if you're neurotic to begin with  <br>01:03:15.720 more neurotic start to develop a sense  <br>01:03:17.839 that you're just not nearly as jacked as  <br>01:03:20.400 you should be or could be or whatever  <br>01:03:22.200 but if you like hang out at an old  <br>01:03:23.480 people home with your grandma and  <br>01:03:24.599 grandpa all the time you're going to  <br>01:03:25.799 feel like Superman all the time because  <br>01:03:27.480 holy [ __ ] you're like you can do real  <br>01:03:28.960 things and move furniture around and and  <br>01:03:31.400 so then go back to that point about  <br>01:03:32.440 weight loss if I'm trying to lose weight  <br>01:03:34.200 what are the biggest biggest myths  <br>01:03:36.200 around weight loss that hold people back  <br>01:03:38.440 and inhibit them one is you have to be  <br>01:03:40.839 perfect if I'm on my diet I'm good if  <br>01:03:43.880 I'm off my diet not only am I bad but as  <br>01:03:46.599 soon as I'm off my diet I have sinned  <br>01:03:48.880 and there is no Solace for me um I a lot  <br>01:03:53.279 of people have that falling off the  <br>01:03:54.520 bandwagon thing where eat clean food  <br>01:03:57.400 whatever that means diet food for weeks  <br>01:03:59.880 and weeks and weeks they have one Kebab  <br>01:04:01.799 they have one cheeseburger and they're  <br>01:04:03.039 like do it that's it man I'm done  <br>01:04:06.880 dieting I'm not a good person anymore  <br>01:04:08.599 it's like that whole dichotomizing and  <br>01:04:11.119 kind of a religious approach that hurts  <br>01:04:13.440 a lot of people because in reality if  <br>01:04:15.760 you just Eat A Cheeseburger your body's  <br>01:04:17.559 like oh sweet like I got a little bit  <br>01:04:18.960 more carbohydrates stored in the muscle  <br>01:04:20.960 I recovered a little bit more my diet  <br>01:04:22.720 fatigue is actually a little lower  <br>01:04:23.839 because you fed me some food tomorrow  <br>01:04:26.160 I'm back on the diet I'm making even  <br>01:04:27.559 better gains than if I didn't have that  <br>01:04:28.839 cheeseburger I was so exhausted and so a  <br>01:04:31.680 lot of people have that approach  <br>01:04:33.240 completely backwards and they're like  <br>01:04:34.480 I'm either good or I'm bad and and  <br>01:04:36.559 that's really tough another one is  <br>01:04:38.960 people think that the approach to lose  <br>01:04:41.160 weight is the same as the approach to  <br>01:04:43.039 maintain it um this is really really  <br>01:04:45.680 really nasty because so my wife is a uh  <br>01:04:48.839 board-certified uh Family Med Sports Med  <br>01:04:51.400 doctor and she does a lot of work  <br>01:04:53.720 international Olympic teams all that  <br>01:04:55.200 stuff  <br>01:04:56.279 and she is looking at these formal  <br>01:04:59.079 recommendations from the medical  <br>01:05:00.520 literature and it's like here's the kind  <br>01:05:02.599 of diet you need to get to lose weight  <br>01:05:05.480 and then she was like she followed up  <br>01:05:07.079 with some of the professionals and she's  <br>01:05:08.240 like and so what about maintenance and  <br>01:05:09.640 they're like uh yep what do you mean yep  <br>01:05:13.559 what are you talking about that's not  <br>01:05:15.400 the conversation so people think okay  <br>01:05:17.480 I'm going to clean up my diet no more  <br>01:05:19.039 ice cream no more no more crisps no more  <br>01:05:21.000 Cheetos I'm gonna eat super healthy and  <br>01:05:23.960 then when I get to the weight that I  <br>01:05:25.279 want  <br>01:05:26.480 I eat continuously super Health never  <br>01:05:29.799 have ice cream again what kind of  <br>01:05:31.520 bizarre world is it and so they'll flop  <br>01:05:33.359 back to the other one well they'll try  <br>01:05:35.000 for a few months after they've gotten to  <br>01:05:36.359 the weight they like to just eat  <br>01:05:37.760 completely super healthy clean  <br>01:05:39.200 everything like that they lose a little  <br>01:05:40.400 bit more weight they're exhausted  <br>01:05:41.760 they're tired they're food focus is  <br>01:05:43.200 driving them nuts they'll eat some ice  <br>01:05:45.319 cream and they'll go I'm a sinner and  <br>01:05:47.720 then ice cream ice cream cheeseburgers  <br>01:05:49.440 cheeseburgers up they go and then they  <br>01:05:51.200 regain all the weight so a huge myth is  <br>01:05:53.640 the fact that yeah when you're you're  <br>01:05:55.760 losing weight you got to pay a little  <br>01:05:57.079 bit more attention to what you eat but  <br>01:05:58.960 once you've gotten to that weight you  <br>01:06:01.079 both need some time roughly every 3  <br>01:06:04.079 months that you diet hard to lose weight  <br>01:06:06.520 you should be taking about at least two  <br>01:06:08.000 months at maintenance just maintaining  <br>01:06:09.720 it so if you weigh 100 kilos iron down  <br>01:06:11.799 to 90 after 3 months for about two or 3  <br>01:06:14.559 months just stay at 90 eat mostly the  <br>01:06:17.240 healthy stuff that you were but throw a  <br>01:06:18.760 little junk in there maintenance again  <br>01:06:20.799 is much easier than losing when  <br>01:06:23.760 physiologically and psychologically your  <br>01:06:26.240 diet fatigue comes down after those two  <br>01:06:28.160 or three months you're able if you'd  <br>01:06:30.319 like to start dieting really hard again  <br>01:06:32.839 to get to that next goal that you have  <br>01:06:34.599 or you just live in balance for the rest  <br>01:06:36.680 but if we tell you like here's your diet  <br>01:06:38.400 to make you lean and healthy and you're  <br>01:06:39.520 like okay how long do I have to do this  <br>01:06:40.640 and the doctor's like  <br>01:06:42.279 forever what what am I supposed to do  <br>01:06:44.359 I'm never I'm never allowed to have  <br>01:06:45.480 teramis Su after dinner ever again I'm  <br>01:06:47.240 like well probably not to that's  <br>01:06:49.279 terrible advice and not only do medical  <br>01:06:50.920 people too often say that most people  <br>01:06:53.039 have that in their heads and it's it's a  <br>01:06:54.520 very very untenable sitation one of the  <br>01:06:56.599 big sort of narratives that I was  <br>01:06:59.079 exposed to for most of my life about  <br>01:07:00.720 weight loss is that 80% of its  <br>01:07:03.799 diet what do you think about those  <br>01:07:05.680 ratios how much of weight loss is  <br>01:07:07.240 determined by diet versus exercise  <br>01:07:10.480 yeah diet has a bigger effect than  <br>01:07:14.000 exercise as a heuristic I'm very  <br>01:07:16.240 comfortable with 8020 there are a couple  <br>01:07:18.480 reasons for that one  <br>01:07:21.200 is there's a constrained energy  <br>01:07:24.200 hypothesis  <br>01:07:25.920 it's also called ponor Paradox based on  <br>01:07:28.119 Herman ponor work and physical  <br>01:07:29.960 anthropology and  <br>01:07:31.960 so basically they realize that the  <br>01:07:34.720 amount of physical activity that humans  <br>01:07:36.559 can do has a range but if you try to get  <br>01:07:40.520 people to like double their physical  <br>01:07:42.559 activity you say I'm not going to change  <br>01:07:44.240 my diet I'm GNA work out twice as much  <br>01:07:46.559 as the next guy your body becomes so  <br>01:07:49.760 fatigued so rapidly and your metabolism  <br>01:07:52.799 adjusts itself your physical activity  <br>01:07:54.799 that's not planned exercise like how  <br>01:07:56.799 much do you get up when someone calls  <br>01:07:58.640 you are you still on the couch talking  <br>01:08:00.039 to them or how much do you get up and  <br>01:08:01.400 walk around your kitchen a bunch your  <br>01:08:03.559 body makes all these adjustments so if  <br>01:08:05.680 you try to really outwork a bad diet it  <br>01:08:08.880 doesn't work and usually you just come  <br>01:08:10.839 back to the same physical activity  <br>01:08:12.240 because you're too exhausted to continue  <br>01:08:13.680 and then you failed whereas with diet  <br>01:08:16.600 you can make some dietary changes  <br>01:08:18.520 principle based like stop eating junk  <br>01:08:21.279 food every day and just eat two pieces  <br>01:08:23.839 of junk food on Friday and two pieces of  <br>01:08:26.158 junk food on Saturday just that alone is  <br>01:08:29.080 sustainable your body as long as these  <br>01:08:31.120 are filling Foods a lot of veggies  <br>01:08:33.479 fruits whole grains lean meats you're  <br>01:08:35.279 not hungry you're just like damn it I  <br>01:08:37.679 want a bag of chips that's not a reason  <br>01:08:40.279 that is mostly psychological it's not  <br>01:08:42.080 physiological and thus dieting is just  <br>01:08:44.839 able to take bigger chunks out of your  <br>01:08:46.920 calorie balance equation without  <br>01:08:49.000 completely destroying it that has limits  <br>01:08:50.640 as well you can't D it forever so you  <br>01:08:52.759 have to take it in chunks another thing  <br>01:08:54.759 is this in order  <br>01:08:56.839 to burn a lot of calories to lose a lot  <br>01:09:00.600 of weight you got to do some serious  <br>01:09:03.560 work the average person will burn  <br>01:09:05.679 something like 100 to 150 calories per  <br>01:09:09.799 mile  <br>01:09:11.040 run oh my God you start thinking about  <br>01:09:13.560 it like a doughnut has 300 calories how  <br>01:09:17.000 fast Stephen can you eat a doughnut if I  <br>01:09:18.799 time  <br>01:09:19.719 you 5 Seconds five no problem boom you  <br>01:09:23.600 going to run three miles after each  <br>01:09:25.040 donut it's insane so taking your diet  <br>01:09:28.799 cleaning it up reducing the junk  <br>01:09:30.040 reducing the calories is not that hard  <br>01:09:32.759 but if you try to fight off the nasty  <br>01:09:34.920 extra junk food calories you're taking  <br>01:09:36.359 in with exercise it's kind of like a  <br>01:09:38.679 three to one fight you you eat two  <br>01:09:41.560 Donuts at your work function after work  <br>01:09:43.920 you got six miles to run that day nobody  <br>01:09:45.920 doing that and that's why diet is such a  <br>01:09:49.359 huge factor it's so easy to do quote  <br>01:09:51.439 unquote damage with it and it's much  <br>01:09:53.359 easier to take control of it versus  <br>01:09:55.520 exercise the boundary layers are just  <br>01:09:57.480 smaller and what you would have to do to  <br>01:09:59.320 fight the bad diet is just grotesquely  <br>01:10:01.440 large and outside of those boundary  <br>01:10:02.840 layers I think this a lot because I  <br>01:10:04.120 think people typically assume that the  <br>01:10:05.719 way to lose weight is to go do a run  <br>01:10:08.000 yeah that's typically you know you'll  <br>01:10:09.679 see people in the gym and if you ask  <br>01:10:11.199 someone why they're on the running  <br>01:10:12.360 machine they'll probably say I'm trying  <br>01:10:13.440 to lose some weight  <br>01:10:15.199 yeah it helps a little  <br>01:10:17.440 bit but if you run and you burn 200  <br>01:10:21.320 calories extra per day 3 days per week  <br>01:10:24.239 then is 600 extra calories you're  <br>01:10:25.920 burning through the week that's good  <br>01:10:28.159 stuff you can lose some decent weight  <br>01:10:30.360 like that are you just going to be more  <br>01:10:31.719 hungry though afterwards uh typically  <br>01:10:34.120 exercise does not dependably increase  <br>01:10:36.159 your hunger in most people so uh uh  <br>01:10:39.360 depending on the context in the  <br>01:10:40.640 individual it's not a Dependable thing  <br>01:10:42.360 to say that doing more exercise  <br>01:10:43.920 necessarily makes you more hungry which  <br>01:10:45.560 is kind of cool because usually you're  <br>01:10:46.880 not really any more hungry and if you  <br>01:10:48.520 stick consistently exercise but you  <br>01:10:50.440 control your diet you're good to go  <br>01:10:52.920 however is there a psychological  <br>01:10:54.000 component to that where because done the  <br>01:10:55.800 run I now feel like I deserve it oh yeah  <br>01:10:59.000 that's huge and some people do have a  <br>01:11:00.679 hunger response but what you put|### SUMMARY  <br>Dr. Michael Israetel discusses effective muscle building strategies, emphasizing minimal time investment and dispelling workout myths.  <br>  <br>### IDEAS:  <br>- Consistency is more important than the total workout hours for muscle building success.  <br>- Specificity in exercise routines leads to better results in targeted muscle growth.  <br>- Even minimal workout duration can yield significant body transformation with proper strategies.  <br>- Muscle gain is retained even after a period of inactivity, thanks to muscle memory.  <br>- Nutrition plays a crucial role in achieving fitness goals, alongside exercise.  <br>- Individuals often overestimate the time required for fitness transformations; efficiency is key.  <br>- Many common fitness myths hinder progress, including the need for extensive gym hours.  <br>- Recovery and nutrition are just as important as the workout itself for muscle growth.  <br>- Psychological factors significantly impact motivation and adherence to fitness routines.  <br>- Gym anxiety is a real concern that affects many newcomers to fitness.  <br>- Effective plans for muscle gain can be tailored to individual goals and lifestyle constraints.  <br>- Two to three sets of targeted exercises can lead to substantial muscle growth.  <br>- The right warm-up can enhance performance and prevent injuries during workouts.  <br>- Meal timing and nutrient quality can influence overall health and muscle growth.  <br>- Sustainable habits are crucial for long-term weight maintenance after reaching fitness goals.  <br>- Caloric intake and expenditure are fundamental in managing body weight effectively.  <br>- Muscle growth is primarily stimulated by tension, not solely dependent on the workout environment.  <br>- Resistance training can be highly effective even with minimal equipment at home.  <br>- Many people underestimate the role of good technique in maximizing workout effectiveness.  <br>- Body image perceptions can influence workout motivation and self-esteem in fitness enthusiasts.  <br>- Eating disorders are complex and not solely caused by calorie awareness or food labeling.  <br>  <br>### INSIGHTS:  <br>- Achieving fitness goals requires a balance of consistent exercise and proper nutrition strategies.  <br>- Many individuals mistakenly think extensive workout hours are necessary for noticeable results.  <br>- Muscle memory allows individuals to regain strength faster after periods of inactivity.  <br>- Effective muscle training relies on both physical and psychological readiness before workouts.  <br>- Regularly revisiting and adjusting fitness goals can enhance motivation and prevent burnout.  <br>- Sustainable dietary habits are crucial for maintaining weight loss and overall health.  <br>- The quality and timing of meals can significantly affect physical performance and recovery.  <br>- Strength training can be accomplished effectively with minimal equipment at home.  <br>- Psychological barriers often impede progress in fitness; addressing these can improve outcomes.  <br>- Understanding the science behind muscle growth can motivate individuals to stick with their routines.  <br>  <br>### QUOTES:  <br>- "Doing this at home will give you phenomenal overall results with not so much time investment."  <br>- "The consistency that matters doesn't matter if it's 2 hours a week or 18 hours a week."  <br>- "Every real working set should be challenging."  <br>- "You can get amazing benefits with minimal time investment."  <br>- "Nutrition for being more lean, more muscular, and healthier... has all these kinds of ideas."  <br>- "Muscle growth occurs when your body is resting, not during the gym session."  <br>- "If you don’t lift for 2 weeks, you start to lose muscle."  <br>- "The average person will burn something like 100 to 150 calories per mile run."  <br>- "Diet has a bigger effect than exercise; it’s easier to control dietary intake."  <br>- "Sustainable habits lead to long-term success in maintaining weight loss."  <br>- "Fitness won't elevate your status as a better person in some way."  <br>- "Training at home is a bit of a different world but can yield amazing results."  <br>- "You can get into really good shape with not so much time investment."  <br>- "You don’t grow muscle at the gym; you give yourself a signal to grow muscle."  <br>- "Calories in, calories out is incontrovertible for the vast majority of people."  <br>- "Muscle dysmorphia often leads individuals to underestimate their actual muscle mass."  <br>- "You can eat regular foods and still achieve great fitness results."  <br>- "The muscle memory effect allows you to regain size faster after a break."  <br>- "Eating disorders are influenced more by genetic and social factors than by calorie awareness."  <br>- "You should be training for hypertrophy with a focus on good technique."  <br>- "Diet fatigue can lead to the perception of needing to be perfect in weight loss."  <br>  <br>### HABITS:  <br>- Consistently assess and adjust fitness goals to stay motivated and aligned with personal desires.  <br>- Incorporate strength training sessions two to three times a week for optimal muscle growth.  <br>- Utilize a balanced diet that includes protein, vegetables, and healthy fats for muscle recovery.  <br>- Prioritize sleep and rest to enhance overall fitness and recovery processes.  <br>- Warm up properly before workouts to improve performance and prevent injuries.  <br>- Track nutritional intake to maintain awareness of caloric and macronutrient consumption.  <br>- Use minimal equipment at home to create effective workout routines.  <br>- Avoid comparing yourself to others in fitness settings to maintain a positive mindset.  <br>- Take regular breaks from intense dieting to maintain motivation and prevent burnout.  <br>- Focus on the quality of movements during weight training for better muscle activation.  <br>  <br>### FACTS:  <br>- Muscle growth primarily occurs when the body is in a state of rest and recovery.  <br>- The average person burns approximately 100 to 150 calories while running a mile.  <br>- Effective muscle training can be achieved with only a couple of hours per week.  <br>- Inactivity leads to muscle loss, starting around two weeks after the last workout.  <br>- Muscle memory significantly aids in regaining strength after periods of inactivity.  <br>- The majority of people find calorie counting unsustainable for long-term weight management.  <br>- Proper nutrition is critical in supporting muscle growth and overall fitness goals.  <br>- Resistance training can be effectively done at home with minimal equipment.  <br>- Emotional and psychological factors play a significant role in fitness adherence.  <br>- Muscle dysmorphia is prevalent among men, leading to distorted self-perceptions of fitness.  <br>  <br>### REFERENCES:  <br>- Dr. Michael Israetel's YouTube channel, which has over 7 million subscribers.  <br>- Discussion on various fitness myths and strategies for effective muscle building.  <br>- Mention of scientific studies related to muscle memory and retraining effects.  <br>- Insights on the role of nutrition and exercise in achieving fitness goals.  <br>- Reference to training techniques and methodologies for muscle hypertrophy.  <br>  <br>### ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY  <br>Effective muscle building requires consistency, proper nutrition, and understanding the science behind fitness routines.  <br>  <br>### RECOMMENDATIONS:  <br>- Focus on consistent training rather than excessive workout hours for effective results.  <br>- Tailor workout plans to individual goals for optimal muscle growth and efficiency.  <br>- Incorporate a variety of exercises

have an  <br>00:00:01.280 impact absolutely and the studies prove  <br>00:00:02.919 it it's an amazing ingredient that's  <br>00:00:04.480 been used for its health benefits for  <br>00:00:06.000 example it has impact on visceral fat  <br>00:00:07.839 and that belly fat yeah it's the fat  <br>00:00:09.440 that's really bad for  <br>00:00:10.840 you yeah you're not supposed to do that  <br>00:00:13.799 Stephen oh gosh the glucose goddess is  <br>00:00:17.119 back Jesse enpay is a biochemist and  <br>00:00:19.640 best-selling author with a focus on  <br>00:00:21.359 nutrition and glucose management she  <br>00:00:23.080 provides simple science-backed tips to  <br>00:00:25.119 improve our health 80% of the population  <br>00:00:27.560 have glucose spikes every single day and  <br>00:00:29.640 that's when problems start happening  <br>00:00:30.920 from mental health to acne to faster  <br>00:00:32.558 aging infertility and PCOS which is one  <br>00:00:35.000 of the leading causes of infertility in  <br>00:00:36.760 women and the problem is we're in a  <br>00:00:38.280 situation where the food landscape is so  <br>00:00:40.000 toxic and most of us just eat sugar and  <br>00:00:42.160 starches but they're literally made up  <br>00:00:43.800 of glucose molecules is there any such  <br>00:00:45.520 thing as good sugar no so even all the  <br>00:00:48.079 fruit that we find today in supermarkets  <br>00:00:49.879 is not natural some people believe that  <br>00:00:51.600 if the sugar is coming from a fruit for  <br>00:00:53.320 example in a fruit smoothie that's good  <br>00:00:55.559 sugar but that's a total lie and your  <br>00:00:57.559 body doesn't differentiate but the sugar  <br>00:00:59.280 isn't a fruit smoothie or the sugars in  <br>00:01:00.600 a chocolate cake are there any foods  <br>00:01:02.160 that have surprised you when you tested  <br>00:01:03.680 them yes I think the biggest ones are  <br>00:01:07.119 wow this begs the question then is there  <br>00:01:09.040 a healthy way to consume sugar so these  <br>00:01:11.000 are four hacks that people can Implement  <br>00:01:13.159 in their lives and you're able to reduce  <br>00:01:14.720 your glucose spikes while still eating  <br>00:01:16.240 what you love and you took these hacks  <br>00:01:17.920 and did an experiment yes and 90% of  <br>00:01:20.360 people reduce their Cravings really  <br>00:01:22.000 significant impacts on sleep hormones  <br>00:01:24.560 mood on diabetes and it says roughly 40%  <br>00:01:27.119 of people who wanted to lose weight did  <br>00:01:28.520 in fact lose weight yep so what are the  <br>00:01:30.640 hacks the first one  <br>00:01:34.200 is this is a sentence I never thought  <br>00:01:36.880 I'd say in my life um we've

<br>00:02:27.200 conversation Jesse in chasby the glucose  <br>00:02:30.800 goddess we spoke two years ago and in  <br>00:02:34.599 that time I feel like there's been a  <br>00:02:36.360 real glucose Revolution much of which  <br>00:02:38.879 has been led by you your books have sold  <br>00:02:40.720 millions and millions and millions of  <br>00:02:41.920 copies around the world your  <br>00:02:43.560 conversations online have millions and  <br>00:02:44.920 millions and millions and millions of  <br>00:02:45.920 views more than I could possibly  <br>00:02:47.879 count what's going on with glucose the  <br>00:02:51.360 thing is glucose has always been  <br>00:02:53.599 incredibly important to our health but  <br>00:02:56.200 it's been going on behind the scenes but  <br>00:02:59.599 now now but with the technology that we  <br>00:03:01.080 have glucose monitors new science we're  <br>00:03:03.440 actually able to get a real good handle  <br>00:03:05.040 on it and understand our diet through  <br>00:03:07.599 that lens so most of us Stephen have  <br>00:03:11.920 unhealthy glucose levels to give you an  <br>00:03:14.000 example one billion people in the world  <br>00:03:15.959 have either type two diabetes or  <br>00:03:17.959 pre-diabetes one billion and that number  <br>00:03:20.680 is increasing every single day and then  <br>00:03:22.840 in people who don't have any health  <br>00:03:24.400 issues up to 80% of the population still  <br>00:03:27.360 has glucose spikes every single day and  <br>00:03:30.319 this leads to lots of symptoms from  <br>00:03:31.959 mental health problems to fertility to  <br>00:03:33.760 acne to faster aging glucose is really  <br>00:03:36.400 important and I'm really happy that  <br>00:03:37.599 we're talking about it more what have  <br>00:03:39.319 you have you been surprised by how much  <br>00:03:41.239 people have woken up to glucose sugar  <br>00:03:44.120 yeah definitely I think even the word  <br>00:03:46.159 glucose people used to know blood sugar  <br>00:03:47.879 but now the fact that people know what  <br>00:03:49.080 glucose is makes me quite happy that's  <br>00:03:51.159 the scientific way to refer to blood  <br>00:03:53.640 sugar it's surprising but the thing is  <br>00:03:55.799 like I'm on the inside I'm working every  <br>00:03:57.599 single day to make sure people know what  <br>00:03:58.959 glucose is so it's like you know when  <br>00:04:01.079 you put the frog in the water and then  <br>00:04:02.560 you slowly boil the water you know that  <br>00:04:04.120 image and the Frog doesn't notice the  <br>00:04:05.560 water is boiling that's how I feel  <br>00:04:07.120 because I've been doing this for five  <br>00:04:08.720 years now so I can tell now if I compare  <br>00:04:11.720 today to five years ago there's been a  <br>00:04:13.200 huge shift but I've been looking at it  <br>00:04:15.319 every single day day by day and the  <br>00:04:17.798 increase has been very gradual how do  <br>00:04:20.600 you define yourself there's this sort of  <br>00:04:23.840 name you go under the glucose goddess  <br>00:04:26.080 but professionally if someone says what  <br>00:04:28.840 you do H how do you define that I say  <br>00:04:31.039 I'm a biochemist I'm a biochemist  <br>00:04:34.039 passionate about sharing science in a  <br>00:04:36.320 fun accessible sexy way that's what I  <br>00:04:38.080 like to do these cgms continuous glucose  <br>00:04:41.400 monitors that everybody seems to be  <br>00:04:43.240 wearing these days they're much of the  <br>00:04:46.720 the reason people I guess know you  <br>00:04:51.759 because you post these incredible graphs  <br>00:04:53.520 on your Instagram showing the impact  <br>00:04:55.479 that of the things we on our glucose  <br>00:04:58.479 levels yeah I want to start there when I  <br>00:05:01.520 eat something sweet and full of sugar  <br>00:05:04.199 there's a spike in my CGM so my  <br>00:05:06.880 continuous glucose monitor does does the  <br>00:05:09.520 spike mean that something bad is going  <br>00:05:12.360 on in my body kind of yeah so I'll go  <br>00:05:16.919 just one step back there's lots of  <br>00:05:19.319 different categories of foods but there  <br>00:05:20.960 are two that impact our blood sugar  <br>00:05:23.039 levels it's starches so that's bread  <br>00:05:26.479 rice pasta potatoes oats and sugars so  <br>00:05:30.479 anything sweet from an apple pie turn  <br>00:05:32.960 orange juice these two categories of  <br>00:05:35.120 foods they're literally made up of  <br>00:05:36.919 glucose molecules so when you eat them  <br>00:05:39.280 they break down into individual glucose  <br>00:05:41.039 molecules and the glucose molecules  <br>00:05:42.639 arrive into your blood if you eat a lot  <br>00:05:44.840 of starches and sugars at once a lot of  <br>00:05:46.919 glucose molecules are arriving into your  <br>00:05:48.600 blood and that's what you see that's the  <br>00:05:50.680 spike you see on your glucose monitor  <br>00:05:53.800 now these Spikes have a few different  <br>00:05:56.880 consequences you know having a few  <br>00:05:58.800 spikes here and there is not not a big  <br>00:06:00.000 deal but if you have really big spikes  <br>00:06:01.919 which I think most of us are discovering  <br>00:06:03.319 we have even if we don't have diabetes  <br>00:06:05.360 that's when problems start happening  <br>00:06:06.919 there's basically three processes that  <br>00:06:08.440 take place in your body when you spike  <br>00:06:10.639 it's chronic fatigue of your  <br>00:06:12.520 mitochondria aging glycation and then  <br>00:06:15.720 insulin release and I can go into detail  <br>00:06:18.000 into these but these are what underpin  <br>00:06:20.319 all the negative consequences of glucose  <br>00:06:22.400 spikes so start with that first one okay  <br>00:06:24.599 the mitochondria so there's these little  <br>00:06:26.800 factories in your cells that are in  <br>00:06:28.280 charge of making energy you must have  <br>00:06:29.800 learned this at school you know the  <br>00:06:30.919 mitochondria is the factory of the cell  <br>00:06:34.000 these little mitochondria are constantly  <br>00:06:36.160 trying to make energy for your body and  <br>00:06:38.919 they turn glucose into energy so you  <br>00:06:41.680 give them glucose through food they turn  <br>00:06:43.199 it into energy and then your brain uses  <br>00:06:45.479 the energy your heart to pump your ears  <br>00:06:47.680 to listen your eyes to see your whole  <br>00:06:50.080 body uses this energy and so you might  <br>00:06:52.440 think okay I want lots of energy so I  <br>00:06:54.479 should give my mitochondria lots of  <br>00:06:55.800 glucose That's The Logical conclusion  <br>00:06:57.960 you might come to but that where it  <br>00:06:59.919 completely collapses see biology is a  <br>00:07:01.639 bit weird take the example of a plant do  <br>00:07:04.319 you have any plants at home I do yeah  <br>00:07:05.919 okay are you able to keep them alive um  <br>00:07:08.319 my cleaning does a great job of keeping  <br>00:07:09.639 all them alive I have a super hard time  <br>00:07:12.560 but the reason I'm bringing up plants is  <br>00:07:14.440 because you know that plants need some  <br>00:07:15.919 water to live but if you give them too  <br>00:07:18.360 much water they drown and they die the  <br>00:07:21.240 human body is kind of the same some  <br>00:07:23.520 glucose amazing steady energy too much  <br>00:07:26.520 glucose and your little mitochondria  <br>00:07:28.680 start freaking out out they get  <br>00:07:30.960 overwhelmed by too much glucose Reviving  <br>00:07:33.240 their way they kind of go on strike and  <br>00:07:35.319 I'm French so I know but they sort of go  <br>00:07:37.560 on strike and they get overwhelmed and  <br>00:07:39.280 stressed out and they're not able to  <br>00:07:40.800 make energy effectively anymore because  <br>00:07:42.599 we're overloading them with too much  <br>00:07:44.960 glucose to process and as a human what  <br>00:07:47.960 do you feel you feel chronic fatigue you  <br>00:07:50.879 wake up you're exhausted thinking of  <br>00:07:52.599 going to the grocery store or picking up  <br>00:07:54.039 your kids is super tiring there's this  <br>00:07:57.720 Energy System in your body is just kind  <br>00:07:59.360 of of broken but you keep eating carbs  <br>00:08:01.639 you know croissant some bread something  <br>00:08:03.960 sweet but you keep being more and more  <br>00:08:05.919 tired that's your mitochondria  <br>00:08:08.080 dysfunctioning so that's the first thing  <br>00:08:09.960 that happens when you spike you get  <br>00:08:11.960 tired your mitochondria gets stressed  <br>00:08:16.199 out and one thing that's interesting is  <br>00:08:19.120 that sometimes when we eat something  <br>00:08:20.520 sweet especially in the morning like an  <br>00:08:21.879 orange juice we kind of feel a sense of  <br>00:08:25.520 like a like a rush of energy you know  <br>00:08:27.120 you have a big glass of orange juice and  <br>00:08:28.639 you sort of perk up for a sec most  <br>00:08:30.639 people think that that is energy what's  <br>00:08:33.159 actually going on is that Sugar releases  <br>00:08:35.640 dopamine in the brain and it's the  <br>00:08:37.679 pleasure molecule it's the same molecule  <br>00:08:39.440 that gets released when you have sex  <br>00:08:41.159 when you play video games when you do  <br>00:08:43.159 illegal drugs sugar releases dopamine  <br>00:08:46.080 it's pleasure it makes you kind of feel  <br>00:08:48.279 awake just briefly but actually that's  <br>00:08:50.800 not energy because on the inside your  <br>00:08:52.519 mitochondria are being damaged so we're  <br>00:08:54.640 being tricked by sugary foods and when  <br>00:08:56.399 we're tired we often reach for something  <br>00:08:58.600 sugary to per us up but it doesn't work  <br>00:09:00.720 on the inside so that's the first thing  <br>00:09:03.040 your mitochondria gets stressed out and  <br>00:09:05.600 as your mitochondria gets stressed out  <br>00:09:07.040 they also release what's called free  <br>00:09:08.480 radicals which is something that  <br>00:09:10.040 increases inflammation in the body and  <br>00:09:11.680 inflammation is really nasty thing we'll  <br>00:09:14.120 get to it in a sec the second thing that  <br>00:09:16.160 happens when you spike has to do with a  <br>00:09:18.440 chicken cooking in the oven so if you  <br>00:09:21.079 put you're looking at me weird but let  <br>00:09:22.399 me explain if you put a chicken in the  <br>00:09:25.000 oven it goes from pink to brown right  <br>00:09:28.600 you've seen this it books this process  <br>00:09:31.120 of cooking is called glycation it's the  <br>00:09:34.399 process of Browning or of cooking same  <br>00:09:37.040 thing when you toast a piece of toast  <br>00:09:38.399 for  <br>00:09:39.200 example the interesting thing is a human  <br>00:09:42.360 being from the moment we're born we're  <br>00:09:44.720 slowly cooking in that same way on the  <br>00:09:48.240 inside we're slowly glycating we're  <br>00:09:50.920 slowly Browning and then when we're  <br>00:09:53.720 fully glycated when we're fully cooked  <br>00:09:57.079 we die that's why when you look at the  <br>00:09:59.800 cartilage of babies it's white and if  <br>00:10:02.040 you look at the cartilage of somebody  <br>00:10:03.320 who's 90 years old it's brown they've  <br>00:10:05.600 cooked on the inside and every glucose  <br>00:10:08.279 Spike increases you're looking at your  <br>00:10:10.160 skin yeah from the outside we'd have to  <br>00:10:13.600 like open you up and look at your  <br>00:10:14.800 cartilage color got about 10 minutes  <br>00:10:18.839 left and every glucose Spike increases  <br>00:10:21.320 his process of glycation so much so that  <br>00:10:23.600 glucose and glycation they kind of sound  <br>00:10:26.120 like a similar word glucose glyc a it's  <br>00:10:30.440 because it's glucose doing the glycating  <br>00:10:33.920 so every glucose Spike increases  <br>00:10:36.519 glycation increases cooking accelerates  <br>00:10:39.519 aging and this shows on your skin you  <br>00:10:42.639 get wrinkles faster if you glycate more  <br>00:10:44.880 and also on the inside your organs  <br>00:10:47.079 slowly get damaged so glucose spikes  <br>00:10:50.200 mitochondria get tired you age  <br>00:10:53.320 faster in response to this your body  <br>00:10:56.480 knows Stephen that a big glucose spike  <br>00:10:58.880 is not good for you your body knows that  <br>00:11:01.279 it has to do something to try to get  <br>00:11:03.000 that glucose level down so what it does  <br>00:11:05.880 it calls up your pancreas and it's like  <br>00:11:08.000 yo pancreas we got a glucose bike going  <br>00:11:09.880 on we need to get this glucose down in  <br>00:11:12.839 response your pancreas sends a hormone  <br>00:11:14.880 called insulin out in your body you've  <br>00:11:17.079 heard of insulin before right and  <br>00:11:19.320 insulin's job and we love her her job is  <br>00:11:21.680 to grab all these excess glucose  <br>00:11:24.079 molecules and to store them away so they  <br>00:11:27.480 don't damage your body anymore and  <br>00:11:29.760 Insulin stores glucose away into your  <br>00:11:32.560 liver into your muscles and then when  <br>00:11:35.600 those are full insulin stores glucose  <br>00:11:38.000 away into your fat cells and that's one  <br>00:11:41.120 of the ways that you gain fat on your  <br>00:11:43.680 body it's in response to the spikes and  <br>00:11:46.000 your body trying to protect you from the  <br>00:11:48.079 spikes the problem is insulin itself has  <br>00:11:51.680 consequences and is the driver of type  <br>00:11:54.160 two diabetes and insulin resistance so  <br>00:11:56.600 to answer your question yes when you see  <br>00:11:58.480 a big spike on your glucose monitor  <br>00:12:00.600 there's some of that going on and the  <br>00:12:02.320 more spikes you have the harder it is  <br>00:12:04.120 going to be for your body to manage your  <br>00:12:05.680 spikes so it kind of becomes a vicious  <br>00:12:07.600 cycle if you keep eating the same way  <br>00:12:09.519 your spice will get bigger and bigger  <br>00:12:11.120 and bigger and bigger over time with  <br>00:12:12.760 more and more damage on that last point  <br>00:12:14.880 about where insulin stores the excess  <br>00:12:17.720 glucose does that mean that if I have  <br>00:12:19.279 more muscle mass I'm better at eating  <br>00:12:23.680 sugary products yep and that's why if  <br>00:12:26.480 you really love cookies the best time to  <br>00:12:28.399 eat them is right after you work out  <br>00:12:30.199 right before you work out because your  <br>00:12:32.120 muscles are really hungry for glucose  <br>00:12:33.880 all the time and the bigger your muscles  <br>00:12:35.440 are the more you use them the more  <br>00:12:37.440 they're going to capture some of that  <br>00:12:38.880 glucose for energy okay so me and my  <br>00:12:41.639 partner we both go to the gym she is  <br>00:12:43.440 significantly smaller than me in every  <br>00:12:44.639 way she's she's short she's you know  <br>00:12:47.279 she's lean um I'm bigger than her I have  <br>00:12:50.399 I have more muscle mass that means that  <br>00:12:52.480 if I have one cookie and she has the  <br>00:12:54.199 exact same cookie then her glucose  <br>00:12:56.680 response is going to be potentially  <br>00:12:58.000 significantly different to mine  <br>00:12:59.959 yes potentially so if you just look at  <br>00:13:02.000 muscle mass since you have more muscle  <br>00:13:03.639 mass you'll be able to handle that  <br>00:13:04.920 cookie better but there's so many things  <br>00:13:07.079 that influence glucose response for  <br>00:13:08.800 example your level of hydration how  <br>00:13:11.240 stressed you are your microbiome your  <br>00:13:13.279 genetics what time of the month you're  <br>00:13:14.920 in when you're female how well you've  <br>00:13:17.240 slept last night I mean there's a few  <br>00:13:19.560 factors so if you were just to compare  <br>00:13:21.360 your Spike to hers you couldn't really  <br>00:13:23.399 draw any conclusions because there's so  <br>00:13:25.720 many confounding variables there's  <br>00:13:28.000 confounding variables give me a window  <br>00:13:29.839 into some of them and why they matter  <br>00:13:31.360 and how they have an impact on my  <br>00:13:32.440 glucose  <br>00:13:33.440 response so I think muscles is a really  <br>00:13:35.839 good example right if two people eat the  <br>00:13:37.680 same exact cookie the person with more  <br>00:13:39.680 muscle mass is going to potentially see  <br>00:13:41.680 a smaller glucose Spike because their  <br>00:13:43.800 muscles are going to absorb more of that  <br>00:13:45.480 glucose and faster if you look at  <br>00:13:48.120 genetics some people are better at  <br>00:13:50.560 growing their fat cells and at growing  <br>00:13:52.680 the number and the size of their fat  <br>00:13:54.440 cells so they have a bigger Reservoir to  <br>00:13:57.160 put glucose in people of South Asian  <br>00:13:59.399 descent for example they tend to have a  <br>00:14:01.399 harder time putting on fat cells and as  <br>00:14:04.240 a result their glucose spikes tend to be  <br>00:14:06.360 bigger because they don't have that  <br>00:14:07.839 storage unit that they can access and  <br>00:14:10.320 increase the size of does that make  <br>00:14:11.880 sense yeah yeah yeah are there any foods  <br>00:14:15.399 that you have been surprised at when  <br>00:14:17.920 you've tested them because this is one  <br>00:14:19.680 of the really shocking things that I  <br>00:14:22.240 discovered when I wore a continuous  <br>00:14:23.360 glucose monitor is I would eat some  <br>00:14:25.759 things that I've been eating for a long  <br>00:14:27.839 long time and they would cause a spike  <br>00:14:29.839 and I like what I thought that was  <br>00:14:31.199 healthy yeah um but what are those  <br>00:14:33.600 things I guess for the suris the  <br>00:14:35.240 surprising ones not just for you but for  <br>00:14:36.880 people that message you and go oh my God  <br>00:14:38.639 Jesse I've been lied to about my tomato  <br>00:14:40.839 ketchup or okay I think the biggest ones  <br>00:14:42.959 are honey and grapes okay so grapes  <br>00:14:46.680 first you think it's a fruit it's  <br>00:14:49.399 healthy it's natural it's good for me  <br>00:14:51.120 right well actually all the fruit that  <br>00:14:53.519 we find today in supermarkets is not  <br>00:14:55.440 natural it is the product of human  <br>00:14:58.320 breeding for thousands and thousands of  <br>00:15:00.160 years to make them extra sweet extra  <br>00:15:02.519 juicy in the same way that humans have  <br>00:15:04.600 been breeding dogs from the time of the  <br>00:15:06.720 gray wolves into Chihuahua and Golden  <br>00:15:09.199 Retrievers these are not natural types  <br>00:15:11.880 of dogs we've bred wolves into these  <br>00:15:14.240 dogs fruit is the same thing we've bred  <br>00:15:17.360 pces of fruit to make these beautiful  <br>00:15:19.759 grapes without any seeds and just this  <br>00:15:22.199 little pocket of sugar and so a grape  <br>00:15:24.199 when you look at it actually it's just a  <br>00:15:26.199 big dose of sugar it's in the fruit  <br>00:15:29.199 format so people think it's good for  <br>00:15:30.480 them but actually when it comes to your  <br>00:15:31.680 glucose levels it's just big glucose  <br>00:15:34.360 Spike so those are really surprising all  <br>00:15:37.399 fruits it varies right so for example  <br>00:15:40.639 berries are lower in Sugar so create a  <br>00:15:43.120 smaller Spike but any tropical fruit  <br>00:15:45.600 like bananas mangoes papayas and then  <br>00:15:48.440 grapes also those are really high in  <br>00:15:50.279 sugar yeah but the thing is you know  <br>00:15:51.880 piece of whole fruit is okay because it  <br>00:15:54.079 has fiber in it the real problem comes  <br>00:15:56.759 when you denature that piece of fruit  <br>00:15:58.360 and you turn it into a juice for example  <br>00:16:00.639 cuz then you're removing that protective  <br>00:16:02.279 fiber just extracting the water and the  <br>00:16:04.480 sugar yeah I've not drank a glass of  <br>00:16:06.440 juice since starting this podcast  <br>00:16:07.959 because so many people have spoken to  <br>00:16:09.240 have told me that it's just like  <br>00:16:10.199 drinking sugar water yeah it's just like  <br>00:16:11.959 drinking a can of Coke but people think  <br>00:16:13.360 well it comes from a piece of fruit so  <br>00:16:15.240 it's natural orange juice comes from  <br>00:16:16.959 oranges therefore it's good for you  <br>00:16:18.920 because it's natural what they don't  <br>00:16:20.319 realize is that the sugar in a can of  <br>00:16:22.600 soda is also natural it comes from sugar  <br>00:16:25.639 beets or canes so if you're you're  <br>00:16:29.079 really looking at the source of the  <br>00:16:30.279 sugar you realize it doesn't matter at  <br>00:16:31.759 all they all come from plants what  <br>00:16:33.319 matters is the concentration and the  <br>00:16:35.240 medium that the sugar is in I understand  <br>00:16:38.600 grapes causing a glucose Spike because  <br>00:16:40.720 when I taste it it tastes sweet but  <br>00:16:43.079 there's some things that I eat that  <br>00:16:44.519 don't taste sweet that cause a glucose  <br>00:16:46.480 Spike and those are the things that I  <br>00:16:48.120 think lie to me like bread like bread  <br>00:16:50.560 like rice yeah well the thing is glucose  <br>00:16:53.399 is actually not sweet what you're  <br>00:16:55.279 tasting in fruit is fructose so let me  <br>00:16:58.199 explain so starches like bread pasta  <br>00:17:02.040 rice potatoes  <br>00:17:04.119 oats those are starches those are  <br>00:17:06.679 literally millions of glucose molecules  <br>00:17:09.439 just attached hand to hand like this  <br>00:17:12.359 that's a starch it's just a long chain  <br>00:17:14.000 of glucose when you eat the starch poof  <br>00:17:16.480 it turns into individual glucose  <br>00:17:17.880 molecules raises your blood sugar even  <br>00:17:19.959 though it doesn't taste sweet in a piece  <br>00:17:22.199 of fruit or in Sugar you're not eating  <br>00:17:24.839 starch what you're eating is sucrose  <br>00:17:27.599 different kind of molecule which which  <br>00:17:28.960 is half glucose half  <br>00:17:32.160 fructose yeah so when it breaks down it  <br>00:17:34.679 gives you glucose and a spike but also  <br>00:17:36.880 fructose that tastes really sweet but  <br>00:17:39.559 doesn't raise your blood sugar levels  <br>00:17:41.080 that much so again on the other side of  <br>00:17:43.480 the queen then are there foods that  <br>00:17:45.360 taste sweet but don't have an impact on  <br>00:17:47.000 my glucose yes  <br>00:17:48.919 sweeteners Stevia aspartame things like  <br>00:17:51.960 that so you saying that I should put  <br>00:17:54.880 sweeters in my food as opposed to Sugar  <br>00:17:58.240 well I think people need to realize that  <br>00:18:00.120 even though sweeteners are not super  <br>00:18:01.440 good for us right of course it's better  <br>00:18:02.960 to drink water than a diet soda the diet  <br>00:18:05.720 soda is better for you than the regular  <br>00:18:07.760 can of soda with the 30 grams of real  <br>00:18:09.880 sugar in there I personally would never  <br>00:18:13.200 have a can of real soda I would always  <br>00:18:15.159 have the diet soda always always always  <br>00:18:17.760 because those sweeteners don't raise  <br>00:18:20.159 your blood sugar levels okay they don't  <br>00:18:22.159 create that big spike and that big  <br>00:18:23.559 insulin Spike and then the drop is there  <br>00:18:26.200 such a good thing as good sugar m  <br>00:18:29.960 is there any such thing as good  <br>00:18:31.919 sugar  <br>00:18:33.520 no people often believe that if the  <br>00:18:36.400 sugar is coming from a fruit and is is  <br>00:18:38.640 for example in a fruit smoothie that  <br>00:18:40.440 they might have in the morning that's  <br>00:18:41.960 good sugar but that Sugar that's in a  <br>00:18:43.520 cake is bad sugar so people tend to  <br>00:18:46.960 compare these two and say oh well I'm  <br>00:18:49.159 having a fruit smoothie that's good for  <br>00:18:50.520 me but oh that chocolate cake would be  <br>00:18:52.080 bad for me that's a total lie it's all  <br>00:18:54.600 the same molecules the molecules in that  <br>00:18:57.039 fruit smoothie and the molecules in that  <br>00:18:59.039 chocolate cake are the same it's sucrose  <br>00:19:01.360 it's the same stuff and your body  <br>00:19:02.960 doesn't differentiate whether the sugar  <br>00:19:05.280 is in a fruit smoothie or the sugar is  <br>00:19:06.760 in a chocolate cake so all sugar is the  <br>00:19:09.679 same even you know honey Agave maple  <br>00:19:12.919 syrup all these things that have these  <br>00:19:14.520 Health Halos because of marketing it's  <br>00:19:16.440 all the same molecules so I recommend  <br>00:19:19.240 that people just have the sugar that  <br>00:19:20.600 they like best don't think that one is  <br>00:19:22.880 going to be better for you than the  <br>00:19:24.039 other and have all sugar as dessert so  <br>00:19:26.960 that fruit smoothie that's also dessert  <br>00:19:28.720 dessert it's not super healthy because  <br>00:19:30.400 it comes from fruits it's just like the  <br>00:19:31.880 chocolate cake and are there is there  <br>00:19:34.080 such a thing as good sweetness and bad  <br>00:19:36.000 sweetness yeah so there's a few  <br>00:19:37.400 categories so the ones that seem to be  <br>00:19:39.320 really fine for us are Stevia monk fruit  <br>00:19:43.039 and allulose the ones that have been  <br>00:19:45.799 linked to quite a few health issues are  <br>00:19:48.960 aspartame ml sucralose so for example a  <br>00:19:53.440 Spartan you usually find it in soda  <br>00:19:55.679 whereas Stevia you might buy a little  <br>00:19:57.320 packet at home and put it in your tea  <br>00:19:59.880 that being said the spart tame is still  <br>00:20:02.799 better for you than the real can of coke  <br>00:20:04.840 with a 30 grams of real sugar so Stevia  <br>00:20:06.960 is something that I shouldn't be no  <br>00:20:08.760 Stevia is good yeah you shouldn't be too  <br>00:20:10.159 concern do you use Stevia I didn't put  <br>00:20:12.039 any Sweetness in anything I didn't put  <br>00:20:13.440 sugar in anything either so I'm trying  <br>00:20:15.240 to stay away have coffee it's just black  <br>00:20:17.000 coffee you don't even eat chocolate of  <br>00:20:19.080 course I chocolate maybe not so much  <br>00:20:21.320 maybe that's not my thing but what's  <br>00:20:23.400 your sweet thing carrot cake what's your  <br>00:20:26.240 sweet thing oh chocolate I love  <br>00:20:28.120 chocolate like my favorite is is like  <br>00:20:29.960 chocolate ice cream with a chocolate  <br>00:20:31.480 brownie and chocolate sauce and  <br>00:20:32.960 chocolate sprinkles anything chocolate  <br>00:20:35.039 that's not very glucose godess well  <br>00:20:37.159 here's where you're wrong Stephen I'm  <br>00:20:38.640 actually not anti- sugar what are you  <br>00:20:40.320 talking about no I love sugar I eat  <br>00:20:42.840 sugar I eat carbs all the time but I  <br>00:20:44.679 want people to know what I know which is  <br>00:20:47.440 how and when to eat those things that's  <br>00:20:49.159 the end of the podcast thank you so much  <br>00:20:51.600 really great to see you  <br>00:20:54.360 again seriously we need to learn how to  <br>00:20:57.480 eat these things cuz they're so  <br>00:20:58.679 delicious in a way that's less bad for  <br>00:21:00.200 our health it's not about cutting them  <br>00:21:01.559 out that would be a diet I don't I'm not  <br>00:21:03.320 I'm not pro diets I'm Pro knowledge and  <br>00:21:06.039 I want to make sure people are not  <br>00:21:06.960 having sugar and dessert for breakfast  <br>00:21:09.000 you know sweet cereal in the morning and  <br>00:21:10.799 orange juice that's dessert anyway I'm  <br>00:21:13.840 all about just trying to empower people  <br>00:21:15.159 with the information so they don't get  <br>00:21:16.840 trapped by these marketing lies are we  <br>00:21:20.120 meant to be eating the amounts of sugar  <br>00:21:22.400 that we eat though like are we meant to  <br>00:21:24.039 be eating any sugar is what does our  <br>00:21:26.080 sort of evolutionary history tell us  <br>00:21:27.600 about our relationship with glucose I  <br>00:21:29.559 think fruit is something we're meant to  <br>00:21:31.279 be eating but the fruit that used to  <br>00:21:32.840 exist was less sweet and harder to  <br>00:21:35.600 digest and more fibrous and then in  <br>00:21:37.440 terms of starches starches are totally  <br>00:21:39.200 fine to eat the problem is today most of  <br>00:21:41.200 us just eat sugar and starches we've  <br>00:21:43.480 completely lost touch with the nice  <br>00:21:46.000 proteins and the organ meats and the  <br>00:21:48.320 fiber and the healthy fats we're in a  <br>00:21:50.360 situation where the food landscape is so  <br>00:21:52.120 toxic and it's so just starches and  <br>00:21:54.400 sugars that people are getting sicker  <br>00:21:55.760 and sicker and sicker and it's addictive  <br>00:21:58.080 and it's cheap so we're in a very  <br>00:22:00.600 difficult situation and that's the  <br>00:22:02.080 situation that you know the gp1s are  <br>00:22:03.880 trying to solve we're in a pickle we are  <br>00:22:06.360 in a pickle are you optimistic about the  <br>00:22:08.960 pickle we're in as it relates to sugar  <br>00:22:10.679 and  <br>00:22:13.880 Creos I have to say yes because the  <br>00:22:16.400 amount of Transformations I see in my  <br>00:22:18.919 readers is really encouraging you know  <br>00:22:21.320 people are reclaiming their health  <br>00:22:22.679 getting power over it understanding food  <br>00:22:25.200 again but we've got a lot of work to do  <br>00:22:27.400 and I can do my work educating people  <br>00:22:29.400 from the ground up on these hacks but we  <br>00:22:31.159 also need like systemic change we need  <br>00:22:33.039 policy we need governments to get  <br>00:22:35.320 involved and we need to find ways to  <br>00:22:37.320 make healthier food because we're just  <br>00:22:38.799 killing the population right now it's  <br>00:22:40.279 really terrible so talking about some of  <br>00:22:42.960 the consequences of a high glucose diet  <br>00:22:47.679 one of them you mentioned earlier when  <br>00:22:48.919 we were talking about glycation is  <br>00:22:51.360 aging has anyone ever done any research  <br>00:22:54.000 to prove that a high glucose diet is  <br>00:22:57.279 associated with correlated with  <br>00:23:00.279 increased or accelerated aging I mean  <br>00:23:03.159 yes because we see that the people who  <br>00:23:04.720 eat the most sugar get the most diseases  <br>00:23:08.240 right so we see correlations but they're  <br>00:23:09.919 not they're not like a clinical trial  <br>00:23:11.600 you can't take two populations and say  <br>00:23:13.440 okay everybody's 30 years old we're  <br>00:23:15.279 going to give this half a healthy no  <br>00:23:17.679 glucose Spike diet and this half glucose  <br>00:23:19.919 spikes every single day and then we'll  <br>00:23:21.480 see when they're 80 you know which group  <br>00:23:23.279 has aged faster we can't do that that's  <br>00:23:25.200 unethical so we have to look at  <br>00:23:27.039 correlations and we see things like if  <br>00:23:29.600 you have really high glucose levels High  <br>00:23:31.440 insulin levels you're more likely to get  <br>00:23:33.080 heart disease dementia depression etc  <br>00:23:36.360 etc we have correlative studies and we  <br>00:23:39.600 understand the mechanism of the  <br>00:23:41.080 glycation what about the superficial  <br>00:23:43.120 signs of aging wrinkles like the  <br>00:23:45.200 wrinkles a lot of skincare products  <br>00:23:47.440 actually Target glycation from the  <br>00:23:48.880 outside in so they'll put like  <br>00:23:50.360 antioxidants on your skin to reduce  <br>00:23:52.760 glycation if you're in the skincare  <br>00:23:54.200 World you'll see glycation mentioned  <br>00:23:55.760 everywhere what they don't do is they  <br>00:23:57.720 don't look at at how to reduce glycation  <br>00:24:00.320 from the inside out which is what I  <br>00:24:02.720 think is more interesting and it's  <br>00:24:04.279 through food by reducing your glucose  <br>00:24:06.000 levels you reduce glycation it's just  <br>00:24:08.000 like a A to B it's very simple so if I  <br>00:24:11.440 want to Stave off wrinkles then I should  <br>00:24:14.400 keep my glucose levels down yes and you  <br>00:24:16.559 should also avoid smoking you know wear  <br>00:24:18.720 sunscreen Etc but in terms of your diet  <br>00:24:20.960 what you want to focus on is focus on  <br>00:24:22.600 reducing glucose spikes yeah absolutely  <br>00:24:24.799 what about things like acne and skin  <br>00:24:26.799 conditions so those are more  <br>00:24:28.480 inflammatory based diseases so eczema  <br>00:24:31.720 psoriasis acne rosacea those are  <br>00:24:35.200 expressions of inflammation going on  <br>00:24:38.159 within your body and I like to think of  <br>00:24:39.720 the skin as a mirror to what's going on  <br>00:24:42.799 within and so inflamation can happen to  <br>00:24:45.600 loads of different factors but one of  <br>00:24:47.120 the factors is glucose spikes so glucose  <br>00:24:49.520 spikes hurt our mitochondria that  <br>00:24:51.840 creates inflammation then glucose spikes  <br>00:24:54.279 lead to glycation which also leads to  <br>00:24:56.159 inflammation and Insulin release and a  <br>00:24:58.600 lot of insulin also increases  <br>00:25:00.279 inflammation so with every glucose Spike  <br>00:25:02.200 you're increasing inflammation within  <br>00:25:04.320 your body and if you're susceptible to  <br>00:25:06.279 any of these skin conditions you can  <br>00:25:07.679 have fups or increase their intensity  <br>00:25:09.679 very simply and does it also have an  <br>00:25:12.640 impact on my hormonal balance I am a lot  <br>00:25:15.640 of my friends I'm in that age range now  <br>00:25:17.039 where a lot of my friends are trying to  <br>00:25:18.320 have children yeah and there's so much  <br>00:25:21.120 talk around things like polycystic ovary  <br>00:25:23.960 syndrome and fertility and you know  <br>00:25:27.720 infertility in men with their sperm and  <br>00:25:29.440 all these kinds of things is there a  <br>00:25:30.760 link between glucose and hormones and  <br>00:25:34.039 fertility yes so we have studies that  <br>00:25:36.440 show that the more insulin resistant you  <br>00:25:38.919 are so insulin resistance is a  <br>00:25:40.559 consequence of just a lot of insulin in  <br>00:25:42.200 the body the more likely you are to be  <br>00:25:43.960 infertile and then we also know that  <br>00:25:47.279 PCOS so polycystic ovarian syndrome  <br>00:25:49.320 which is one of the leading causes of  <br>00:25:51.080 infertility in women we know that 60% of  <br>00:25:53.919 PCOS cases also are people who have  <br>00:25:57.840 insulin resistance there's a link there  <br>00:26:00.559 insulin resistance you're more likely to  <br>00:26:02.399 have PCOS and we also know that when  <br>00:26:04.799 there's a lot of insulin in a female  <br>00:26:06.520 body it tells your ovaries to produce  <br>00:26:09.840 more testosterone testosterone is the  <br>00:26:12.720 male sex hormone and if you have too  <br>00:26:14.880 much male sex hormone in the body that  <br>00:26:17.360 causes issues it can cause acne it can  <br>00:26:19.679 cause balding or hair growth on the face  <br>00:26:21.960 and it can stop your period now often  <br>00:26:24.919 when somebody has PCOS they're given the  <br>00:26:26.880 birth control pill  <br>00:26:28.760 which kind of makes sense on the surface  <br>00:26:30.480 but really doesn't solve anything what  <br>00:26:32.279 happens when you take the birth control  <br>00:26:33.480 pill is that you're just ingesting  <br>00:26:35.120 female hormones that's what the pill is  <br>00:26:37.240 it's female hormones so if you have high  <br>00:26:39.640 testosterone all of a sudden you're  <br>00:26:41.320 ingesting female hormones so the balance  <br>00:26:44.320 kind of comes back to an okay situation  <br>00:26:46.960 your symptoms of excess testosterone go  <br>00:26:50.039 away but as soon as you stop the pill  <br>00:26:53.000 the high testosterone is still there so  <br>00:26:55.320 a lot of people stop the pill trying to  <br>00:26:57.279 have a baby and they're like oh  <br>00:26:58.799 I don't have my period I have PCOS what  <br>00:27:01.919 do I do so one recommendation I have is  <br>00:27:04.559 if you have PCOS look at your glucose  <br>00:27:06.360 bikes first it's not the only reason  <br>00:27:08.480 this can happen but very often when you  <br>00:27:10.799 fix your glucose and insulin levels the  <br>00:27:12.919 symptoms of PCOS go away I was saw  <br>00:27:15.880 something on Twitter a couple of weeks  <br>00:27:16.919 ago that was trying to make the case  <br>00:27:19.159 that glucose and Insulin responses are  <br>00:27:23.760 the reason for PCOS yeah some people  <br>00:27:26.799 believe that totally you know it's a  <br>00:27:29.000 very politically charged topic some  <br>00:27:31.840 people believe you have PCOS it's  <br>00:27:34.200 genetic you can't do anything about it  <br>00:27:35.960 other people believe no no it's a  <br>00:27:37.279 metabolic disease it's a cluster of  <br>00:27:39.120 symptoms that come from high insulin I'm  <br>00:27:40.919 in that camp but you know there are some  <br>00:27:43.519 cases where somebody has PCOS and  <br>00:27:45.159 doesn't have high insulin levels so what  <br>00:27:47.480 category do they go into the thing with  <br>00:27:49.279 PCOS Stephen is that it's not a real  <br>00:27:51.720 Condition it's like a cluster of  <br>00:27:53.120 symptoms so some people could have PCOS  <br>00:27:55.559 and have cystic ovaries and balding  <br>00:27:57.840 somebody else could have PCOS and have  <br>00:27:59.840 you know missed periods and hair growth  <br>00:28:02.000 on their chin so it can take different  <br>00:28:04.559 forms so I think we're starting to  <br>00:28:06.399 understand there there variations of  <br>00:28:08.320 PCOS and some are in the insulin  <br>00:28:10.399 resistant category have you seen a woman  <br>00:28:13.120 res reverse have PCOS symptoms tons in  <br>00:28:16.039 my second book I ran a study three  <br>00:28:19.159 females who were in the program doing my  <br>00:28:21.200 hacks for just a month got their period  <br>00:28:24.200 back and were able to get pregnant in  <br>00:28:26.760 that month just with my hacks I see PCOS  <br>00:28:29.200 reversal all the  <br>00:28:31.279 time so these hacks that you you say  <br>00:28:34.039 those three women use to help reverse  <br>00:28:36.440 their their PCOS  <br>00:28:38.480 symptoms what are the hacks oh the hacks  <br>00:28:42.120 what are the ones that they did so the  <br>00:28:43.720 ones they did were Savory  <br>00:28:46.399 breakfast vinegar once a day veggie  <br>00:28:50.039 starters and moving after eating and  <br>00:28:53.360 these are four hacks that are the four  <br>00:28:56.399 most important ones of my 10 hacks that  <br>00:28:59.320 I've put together in the four-week  <br>00:29:00.760 method that second  <br>00:29:02.760 book and if you do these hacks you don't  <br>00:29:06.080 actually have to change anything else  <br>00:29:07.399 that you're eating you don't have to cut  <br>00:29:08.919 out anything you just add these in I  <br>00:29:11.200 like to see them like um little fairy  <br>00:29:13.840 godmothers that you have in your pocket  <br>00:29:15.200 and you just put throughout your day  <br>00:29:16.320 like this and you're able to reduce your  <br>00:29:17.960 glucose spikes while still eating what  <br>00:29:19.600 you love in a very low efforts kind of  <br>00:29:21.840 way and I believe these hacks should be  <br>00:29:23.880 seen like you would  <br>00:29:25.440 see brush your teeth wear sunscreen  <br>00:29:28.640 drink enough water have a Savory  <br>00:29:30.240 breakfast move after eating have a  <br>00:29:32.000 Savory breakfast so are you saying  <br>00:29:34.120 people shouldn't be eating sugar for  <br>00:29:35.399 breakfast correct so the concept of a  <br>00:29:37.600 savory breakfast comes from the simple  <br>00:29:40.080 realization that if you have a breakfast  <br>00:29:43.360 that creates a big glucose Spike you're  <br>00:29:45.720 affecting your body in many bad ways  <br>00:29:48.760 first of all you're leading to your  <br>00:29:50.480 brain not functioning too well during  <br>00:29:52.480 that day it's leading to brain fog it  <br>00:29:54.519 can make you a bit confused second it  <br>00:29:56.399 makes you tired it increases Cravings  <br>00:29:58.919 throughout the day and it also  <br>00:30:00.440 deregulates your glucose levels for the  <br>00:30:02.840 rest of the day your breakfast is very  <br>00:30:05.039 powerful if you have a glucose bike at  <br>00:30:07.120 breakfast your whole day is a glucose  <br>00:30:09.279 roller coaster so what you want to do  <br>00:30:11.080 Stephen is always have a Savory  <br>00:30:13.440 breakfast that keeps your glucose level  <br>00:30:15.080 steady a Savory breakfast is what it's  <br>00:30:17.360 based around  <br>00:30:18.600 protein eggs uh fish meat tofu nuts  <br>00:30:23.360 Dairy protein powder dinner leftovers  <br>00:30:25.640 okay protein it's really important to  <br>00:30:27.600 have protein in the morning then you add  <br>00:30:29.399 some healthy fats olive oil butter  <br>00:30:31.840 avocado and then if you want for taste  <br>00:30:34.960 you can add a bit of starch like a piece  <br>00:30:37.080 of bread for example or some potatoes  <br>00:30:39.960 importantly a Savory breakfast contains  <br>00:30:42.159 nothing sweet no cereal no muffins no  <br>00:30:44.880 orange juice no granola no fruit puree  <br>00:30:48.960 none of that it's really key sugar in my  <br>00:30:51.080 coffee no no no no if you want sugar  <br>00:30:54.720 have it as dessert after a meal after  <br>00:30:57.360 lunch or after after dinner because  <br>00:30:59.159 after your lunch and after your dinner  <br>00:31:00.760 you have lots of food already in the  <br>00:31:02.279 digestive system so any sugar you put in  <br>00:31:05.159 afterwards is going to impact your  <br>00:31:06.639 glucose levels less you said that if I  <br>00:31:09.840 have something sweet for my breakfast  <br>00:31:11.240 I'm then going to be on a glucose roller  <br>00:31:12.760 coaster yeah why because glucose Spike  <br>00:31:17.320 then insulin comes out and your glucose  <br>00:31:19.720 drop then your glucose are low here you  <br>00:31:23.360 get really hungry you have a lot of  <br>00:31:24.960 cravings when our glucose levels are  <br>00:31:26.799 dropping scientists have shown it  <br>00:31:28.600 increases the activity of the craving  <br>00:31:30.279 Center in our brain so it goes like  <br>00:31:32.519 Stephen eat some sugar and you can't  <br>00:31:35.399 control that so what you do you reach  <br>00:31:37.440 for more sugar bam another glucose Spike  <br>00:31:40.399 and then you just continue your whole  <br>00:31:42.080 day like that so you sort of put  <br>00:31:44.399 yourself into a corner if you start your  <br>00:31:46.159 day with a spike and it's really  <br>00:31:47.639 difficult to get off that roller coaster  <br>00:31:50.000 does that roller coaster last across  <br>00:31:52.960 days good question generally during the  <br>00:31:55.760 night is sort of resets and my glucose  <br>00:31:58.279 test I saw that when I go to sleep it  <br>00:31:59.760 kind of flattens out kind of goes quite  <br>00:32:01.120 low at night time  <br>00:32:03.960 however I've got this unscientific  <br>00:32:06.679 observation where if I start if I had a  <br>00:32:09.360 carrot cake now um there's a high  <br>00:32:11.880 probability that I'd probably want to  <br>00:32:13.159 have a carrot cake by dinner time  <br>00:32:14.360 tonight as well and then when I wake up  <br>00:32:16.639 the next day I probably I'm going to be  <br>00:32:19.000 more likely to go for the carrot cake  <br>00:32:20.279 again and I if I if I zoomed out on my  <br>00:32:22.720 life say the whole 12 months of a year  <br>00:32:25.880 there will be maybe like this little  <br>00:32:28.279 week or two in clusters where maybe  <br>00:32:31.200 there's a couple of months in between  <br>00:32:32.240 and then there's this two we [ __ ]  <br>00:32:33.919 Splurge again where I find it really  <br>00:32:36.080 hard not to reach for something across  <br>00:32:38.399 multiple days now I'm not sure if this  <br>00:32:40.039 is in my head I think there's a few  <br>00:32:41.760 things going on one The Taste is really  <br>00:32:43.639 addictive so you get addicted to getting  <br>00:32:45.720 that taste and getting the dopamine  <br>00:32:47.159 don't forget there's the dopamine rush  <br>00:32:48.600 in your brain second with every glucose  <br>00:32:50.960 Spike you're actually deregulating your  <br>00:32:52.559 hunger hormones so you get you have more  <br>00:32:54.919 Cravings you're hungrier and yes this  <br>00:32:56.440 can totally last for a few days and I  <br>00:32:58.440 think thirdly if you have the carrot  <br>00:32:59.840 cake at home for a few days maybe you're  <br>00:33:01.720 just more likely to reach for it because  <br>00:33:02.960 it's there you know but I feel I feel  <br>00:33:04.679 similarly to you I have these phases  <br>00:33:07.480 especially if I'm really busy and I  <br>00:33:08.679 can't do all the hacks all the time  <br>00:33:10.279 where I'm eating a bunch of sugar and  <br>00:33:12.000 then it lasts until I say okay stop back  <br>00:33:14.519 on the hacks and I do the hacks for two  <br>00:33:16.039 days and then I'm good again that's the  <br>00:33:17.960 same with me but also I find that if I  <br>00:33:19.799 do a really big workout yeah for me it  <br>00:33:22.080 helps to break that cycle so if I this  <br>00:33:24.799 weekend I did a re I was I think I was  <br>00:33:26.279 in that cycle of like I wasn't reaching  <br>00:33:28.840 for sugar as in like something sweet I  <br>00:33:30.880 was reaching for like I was having a lot  <br>00:33:32.120 of like toast with my breakfast or I was  <br>00:33:33.880 having like carbs and then I did a  <br>00:33:36.240 really big workout and the last thing I  <br>00:33:37.880 wanted was anything with carbs in or  <br>00:33:39.720 glucose I think it's also in the brain  <br>00:33:41.399 you know cuz you're rebalancing those  <br>00:33:43.840 hormones that dopamine you're getting  <br>00:33:45.399 endorphins from the workout so you're  <br>00:33:47.320 not seeking all that pleasure from just  <br>00:33:49.399 sugar okay I think if you're in a cycle  <br>00:33:51.279 where all you're just getting dopamine  <br>00:33:52.919 from sugar it just becomes addictive and  <br>00:33:54.399 you have to do stuff in your life that  <br>00:33:55.840 allows you to feel good in your brain  <br>00:33:57.279 without having that sugar so maybe I got  <br>00:33:59.399 the dopamine from the workout instead  <br>00:34:01.559 totally and so I kind of shifted yeah  <br>00:34:04.200 the source of dopamine so that was the  <br>00:34:06.080 first hack which is Theory breakfast  <br>00:34:08.719 Super Key by the way if you just do one  <br>00:34:10.918 hack do this one it is a complete  <br>00:34:13.199 GameChanger and a Savory breakfast  <br>00:34:15.440 should keep you satiated for 4 hours  <br>00:34:18.199 which is a long time most people get  <br>00:34:20.480 hungry again 2 hours after they have  <br>00:34:22.839 breakfast so make sure you're having  <br>00:34:24.599 enough protein in your breakfast to stay  <br>00:34:26.199 full for four hours  <br>00:34:28.239 okay on that what if I fast totally fine  <br>00:34:31.679 make sure the first meal of your day is  <br>00:34:33.399 also Savory so it can be at 8 a.m. it  <br>00:34:35.520 can be at 4 P.M I do not care as long as  <br>00:34:38.159 the first thing that you eat is  <br>00:34:39.520 something Savory because when you're  <br>00:34:41.280 fasted your digestive system is super  <br>00:34:43.760 empty and sensitive so whatever you give  <br>00:34:46.000 it whether it's in the morning after  <br>00:34:47.440 just sleeping or whether it's after a  <br>00:34:48.918 two week fast is going to go really  <br>00:34:50.960 quickly into your bloodstream so you  <br>00:34:52.399 have to be cautious and make sure you're  <br>00:34:54.599 not giving your body glucose otherwise  <br>00:34:57.200 big [ __ ] do you think fasting is good  <br>00:35:00.240 for you inent  <br>00:35:02.520 fasting I think it's nuanced I think  <br>00:35:05.040 what I've seen is that in men it just  <br>00:35:07.079 works way better in females it can kind  <br>00:35:10.440 of mess up your hormones you have to be  <br>00:35:12.000 a bit um judicious about when you fast  <br>00:35:15.359 and we also have to remember guys  <br>00:35:17.480 fasting is a stressor on the body it is  <br>00:35:20.440 a good stressor but it is a stressor so  <br>00:35:23.520 if you have an intense job kids to take  <br>00:35:26.680 care of you drink coffee you have you  <br>00:35:29.119 know three times a week you do hit  <br>00:35:31.200 cardio then you do a sauna then you do a  <br>00:35:33.359 cul lunch then you fast your body is  <br>00:35:35.240 going to freak the [ __ ] out you have to  <br>00:35:36.960 like dose these stressors in a way that  <br>00:35:39.920 is going to be manageable for your body  <br>00:35:41.599 I see lots of women who do all those  <br>00:35:43.560 things I just mentioned and then they're  <br>00:35:45.160 like and I don't have my perod and I  <br>00:35:46.560 don't understand I don't feel good I'm  <br>00:35:47.960 like your body is freaking out like  <br>00:35:50.560 relax you can't be putting all these  <br>00:35:52.640 stressors on yourself all the time so I  <br>00:35:55.200 fast when I'm on vacation and what kind  <br>00:35:57.839 of fasting do you do I like we'll skip a  <br>00:35:59.880 meal we'll skip dinner we'll skip  <br>00:36:01.480 breakfast and it just helps your body  <br>00:36:03.599 clean up its dead cells and it's really  <br>00:36:05.520 helpful but we have to remember that  <br>00:36:08.800 fasting is a stressor it has great  <br>00:36:10.920 benefits but you don't have to fast in  <br>00:36:13.280 order to be healthy it's very important  <br>00:36:15.240 to also look at what you're eating  <br>00:36:17.000 because if you're fasting 16 hours a day  <br>00:36:19.400 and then you're just eating junk food  <br>00:36:21.200 it's not going to be helpful to your  <br>00:36:22.480 body we have to do both in combination  <br>00:36:24.839 do you fast naturally yeah so I haven't  <br>00:36:28.440 eaten today what time are we we 1:00 um  <br>00:36:31.280 and I won't eat until you've had a  <br>00:36:33.480 coffee I've had a coffee this morning  <br>00:36:36.119 yeah but I won't eat until what 400 p.m.  <br>00:36:39.000 5:00 p.m. which will be probably you  <br>00:36:40.839 know after I get back to the office and  <br>00:36:42.400 stuff like that you feel good I feel  <br>00:36:43.880 fine so that's the thing right my  <br>00:36:45.760 recommendation is if you feel great Fab  <br>00:36:48.119 if you feel stressed out if you feel  <br>00:36:49.520 light-headed if it feels hard yeah then  <br>00:36:51.800 don't do it your body can't handle it  <br>00:36:53.000 just doesn't cross my mind to eat I  <br>00:36:54.319 don't know how people eat it's amazing  <br>00:36:56.040 yeah then go for it live your life Man  <br>00:36:58.560 live your life Stephen what about  <br>00:36:59.720 calorie restriction do you think much  <br>00:37:01.000 about that I mean it works right if you  <br>00:37:03.079 if few calories you're going to lose  <br>00:37:05.760 weight but this is one of my favorite  <br>00:37:08.079 stories do you know how calories were  <br>00:37:11.520 invented maybe okay they like put it in  <br>00:37:13.880 a box and burnt it they put yes I I told  <br>00:37:16.160 you that yes so back in the day to  <br>00:37:18.880 measure calories what do you want to  <br>00:37:20.079 measure the calorie of tell me something  <br>00:37:21.920 some my food car cake  <br>00:37:24.319 okay okay so if we were back in the day  <br>00:37:26.800 like 100 years ago and we wanted to  <br>00:37:28.040 measure the calories in your carrot cake  <br>00:37:29.680 here's what we would do we would take  <br>00:37:31.119 the carrot cake put it in a box then put  <br>00:37:33.760 this box in an aquarium filled with  <br>00:37:36.680 water so you have the aquarium and then  <br>00:37:39.520 inside you have the box with the carrot  <br>00:37:40.920 cake then we would light the carrot cake  <br>00:37:43.720 on fire inside the small box and measure  <br>00:37:47.160 by how many degrees the water in the  <br>00:37:49.520 aquarium increased in temperature so  <br>00:37:52.599 we're just measuring the heat that is  <br>00:37:56.079 created when we burn the carrot cake  <br>00:37:58.880 that is how we measure calories by how  <br>00:38:01.319 much heat is generated when you burn a  <br>00:38:03.319 food so if you were to put in that same  <br>00:38:05.480 box I don't know three avocados and you  <br>00:38:07.760 burnt them you might get the same  <br>00:38:10.000 temperature increase in the water so you  <br>00:38:11.440 might say oh this carrot cake and these  <br>00:38:12.920 three avocados have the same number of  <br>00:38:14.760 calories but the thing is with the  <br>00:38:16.280 calorie thing it's not actually telling  <br>00:38:18.119 you what's in the food it's just  <br>00:38:20.400 measuring energy that dissipated when  <br>00:38:22.839 you burnt it it's not telling you the  <br>00:38:25.079 carrot cake is going to lead to a big  <br>00:38:26.680 glucose Spike going to make you inflamed  <br>00:38:28.960 age faster release insulin whereas the  <br>00:38:31.079 three avocados will keep you steady and  <br>00:38:32.680 feeling better so two people can be  <br>00:38:35.160 eating 2,000 calories diets one person  <br>00:38:38.480 can be eating in a way that keeps their  <br>00:38:39.960 glucose nice and steady they feel good  <br>00:38:42.480 good energy F Cravings clear brain not  <br>00:38:45.599 super hungry all the time the other  <br>00:38:47.440 person can be eating just glucose  <br>00:38:49.000 spiking food and they're having a  <br>00:38:50.240 terrible time they're hungry constantly  <br>00:38:52.560 they have cravings brain fog insulin  <br>00:38:54.400 release so calories are interesting but  <br>00:38:57.160 they're not not everything we need to  <br>00:38:58.240 teach people about the molecules in  <br>00:38:59.760 their food I find that to be a much  <br>00:39:01.960 easier way to try to eat a bit less if  <br>00:39:04.000 you're trying to lose some fat is to  <br>00:39:06.160 just focus on your glucose levels  <br>00:39:07.440 because naturally your hunger hormones  <br>00:39:09.760 will rebalance you'll have few cravings  <br>00:39:11.359 and it's much easier to eat less is  <br>00:39:14.280 there a story that you've been sent or a  <br>00:39:16.240 case study from someone that's followed  <br>00:39:17.880 your work that's stuck with you someone  <br>00:39:20.040 that's understood their glucose and had  <br>00:39:21.760 a big shift in their life I imagine  <br>00:39:23.119 there's thousands but yeah there's many  <br>00:39:26.359 many I think for there's two things for  <br>00:39:28.720 me there's the the pregnancy stories  <br>00:39:30.839 because I think that's so touching  <br>00:39:31.920 because I've had many friends go through  <br>00:39:33.920 difficult fertility Journeys and to hear  <br>00:39:36.319 people who were about to embark on  <br>00:39:38.400 really intense fertility treatments and  <br>00:39:39.960 just tried this and then got pregnant I  <br>00:39:41.319 think that's really cool and then second  <br>00:39:43.400 I think it's the people  <br>00:39:45.040 whom there was this one guy he's had  <br>00:39:47.720 diabetes his whole life he's like in his  <br>00:39:49.400 50s um on lots of medication and just  <br>00:39:53.079 thought he would lose a leg and lose his  <br>00:39:55.040 vision that's what happens when you have  <br>00:39:56.240 type two for a very long time  <br>00:39:58.079 and the thing is his doctors had never  <br>00:39:59.720 explained to him why he had diabetes  <br>00:40:01.720 they had just told him you know take  <br>00:40:02.880 this pill and I take this insulin and he  <br>00:40:05.520 read my book and he understood why he  <br>00:40:07.720 got diabetes in the first place and he  <br>00:40:10.480 did the hacks he was able to reverse his  <br>00:40:12.640 type two diabetes in one year all his  <br>00:40:15.000 doctors were like how did you do it you  <br>00:40:16.960 know doctors don't often have this kind  <br>00:40:18.599 of information and then he sent me a  <br>00:40:20.520 long message saying now I'll be able to  <br>00:40:22.280 see my grandkid wedding and I really  <br>00:40:23.920 thank you for that it's so cute you know  <br>00:40:27.000 we're all we're all stuck in this  <br>00:40:29.960 vicious cycle of having this toxic food  <br>00:40:32.079 around us that's making us sick but not  <br>00:40:34.800 understanding how to get out of it and  <br>00:40:36.760 everybody wants to be healthy that man  <br>00:40:39.359 he was eating stuff that he thought  <br>00:40:41.119 would be good for him he was eating like  <br>00:40:43.119 the low calorie rice cakes and the fruit  <br>00:40:46.079 smoothies and the lowfat yogurts and all  <br>00:40:48.599 these things trying to be healthier but  <br>00:40:51.280 if you don't have the right information  <br>00:40:52.680 you can't actually make a change what  <br>00:40:55.640 would you say to parents it's it's  <br>00:40:57.680 really interesting cuz I I've had the  <br>00:40:59.520 experience of watching a lot of early  <br>00:41:01.000 parents over the last couple of months  <br>00:41:02.680 and um they care so much about their  <br>00:41:06.240 kids just eating it something that often  <br>00:41:08.839 they'll give them something that is high  <br>00:41:10.319 in glucose does it matter you know  <br>00:41:13.200 because sometimes people look at kids  <br>00:41:14.240 and go well they're a kid they they'll  <br>00:41:16.000 kind of it won't have an impact on them  <br>00:41:18.160 they'll kind of grow out of it yeah well  <br>00:41:20.240 we'll make sure that they eat healthy  <br>00:41:21.400 later we just need to make sure they eat  <br>00:41:22.839 something now listen we used to think  <br>00:41:25.520 type two diabetes was a disease is  <br>00:41:27.480 reserved for adults and now 5-year-olds  <br>00:41:29.240 get it it's very important to help your  <br>00:41:31.560 kids eat well so that they set up their  <br>00:41:33.720 body in a healthy way one thing that I  <br>00:41:35.640 hear is yeah Jesse I know I should be  <br>00:41:37.400 giving my kids eggs in the morning but  <br>00:41:40.040 they just keep begging for the cereal  <br>00:41:41.640 and I just I can't say no you know they  <br>00:41:43.760 they won't they won't let go I have to  <br>00:41:45.760 give it to them and I say what if they  <br>00:41:47.640 were begging you for  <br>00:41:49.280 cigarettes would you give them the  <br>00:41:51.359 cigarettes like you don't actually have  <br>00:41:53.800 to give your kids this food it's hard  <br>00:41:56.960 for for sure but if it's a priority for  <br>00:41:59.319 you you can totally do it absolutely and  <br>00:42:01.960 I think it's important to set an example  <br>00:42:04.839 actually because if you're having cereal  <br>00:42:06.440 and orange juice it's going to be really  <br>00:42:07.720 hard for your kids to take you seriously  <br>00:42:09.400 like come on dad like you know shut up  <br>00:42:12.200 what you think of giving kids orange  <br>00:42:13.440 juice oh my God it's terrible it's the  <br>00:42:15.240 worst it's it's it's just terrible it's  <br>00:42:17.960 big rush of sugar can affect it can  <br>00:42:20.319 affect Behavior you know tantrums and  <br>00:42:23.160 the sugar cravings and the sugar lows I  <br>00:42:26.400 mean no it's terrible it breaks my heart  <br>00:42:28.880 I'm like wow those little bodies are not  <br>00:42:31.200 happy right now you know there's so many  <br>00:42:33.920 parents that are listening right now  <br>00:42:35.800 like you don't [ __ ] get it you too  <br>00:42:38.400 childless better totally and that's why  <br>00:42:40.599 Stephen you know when I have kids I  <br>00:42:42.280 totally want to write a book about that  <br>00:42:43.559 because I think there's lots of stuff we  <br>00:42:44.559 can teach a parents about how to feed  <br>00:42:47.040 their kids it's too easy for me to say  <br>00:42:49.079 this stuff I don't have kids I don't  <br>00:42:50.119 know how it is but I can tell you one  <br>00:42:51.559 thing there will be no orange juice in  <br>00:42:53.960 my house no orange juice like my mom my  <br>00:42:57.319 mom was addicted to diet coke when she  <br>00:42:58.839 was younger so we never had soda in our  <br>00:43:00.680 house never and I hate I hate soda now I  <br>00:43:03.359 would never be able to drink any of that  <br>00:43:05.240 stuff because it was never I never  <br>00:43:06.839 learned to like it so don't be scared  <br>00:43:09.040 that your kid is going to binge if you  <br>00:43:11.040 restrict all the sugary stuff I think  <br>00:43:12.559 it's the opposite I think if you don't  <br>00:43:13.920 give them the Habit they just won't have  <br>00:43:15.240 the habit I do agree we we um we didn't  <br>00:43:17.880 have many sweet things or fizzy drinks  <br>00:43:20.960 or anything in in the house and I think  <br>00:43:22.400 as a kid I was resentful because you  <br>00:43:24.359 you'd go to school and you'd see those  <br>00:43:25.640 things you you'd lean towards them and  <br>00:43:27.319 you'd love them at school but frankly as  <br>00:43:29.079 I've grown older I'm completely cool  <br>00:43:30.920 with just drinking water all the time  <br>00:43:33.200 that's part partly because that's what  <br>00:43:34.480 we had in the house so my relationship  <br>00:43:36.160 with water is pretty strong I feel you  <br>00:43:38.280 but you know one thing that parents do  <br>00:43:39.599 tell me is that when they do their  <br>00:43:40.680 glucose hacks and they manage their  <br>00:43:42.280 glucose levels they're able to be more  <br>00:43:43.960 Zen around their kids and sort of you  <br>00:43:46.079 know stay a bit more um centered when  <br>00:43:49.040 their kids are freaking out or asking  <br>00:43:50.520 about something a lot their their mood  <br>00:43:52.400 is steadier so they can actually make  <br>00:43:53.920 better choices for the whole family and  <br>00:43:55.280 they have a bit more stamina and uh then  <br>00:43:57.960 their kids do the hacks and their kids  <br>00:44:01.079 get calmer and then the family is just  <br>00:44:02.880 having a better time generally but it  <br>00:44:05.079 can really  <br>00:44:06.319 impact even a marriage this a great  <br>00:44:08.520 study I have to tell you about that was  <br>00:44:10.680 looking at married couples so they  <br>00:44:12.559 recruited 300 married couples and bless  <br>00:44:15.160 these scientists they're just insane so  <br>00:44:17.400 they recruited 300 married couples they  <br>00:44:20.000 gave each person in the marriage a  <br>00:44:22.640 voodoo doll representing their spouse so  <br>00:44:26.680 if you're in a marriage you have a  <br>00:44:27.880 voodoo doll representing your husband or  <br>00:44:29.400 your wife scientists then asked the  <br>00:44:32.400 people to put a pin in the voodo doll  <br>00:44:36.440 representing their spouse every time  <br>00:44:38.319 their spouse annoyed them for six weeks  <br>00:44:42.400 at the end of the study they took all  <br>00:44:43.839 the voodoo dolls counted the pins they  <br>00:44:45.839 also measured the participants glucose  <br>00:44:48.520 levels what they found Stephen is that  <br>00:44:51.960 those who had more variable glucose  <br>00:44:54.400 levels specifically those who had more  <br>00:44:56.160 low glucose level events which happens  <br>00:44:58.440 after spikes had put more pins in the  <br>00:45:02.520 voodoo doll representing their spouse so  <br>00:45:05.359 their glucose levels seem to be linked  <br>00:45:07.240 to how irritated they were with their  <br>00:45:09.079 partner and then the scientists  <br>00:45:10.880 speculated that this had to do with a  <br>00:45:13.000 neurotransmitter called tyrosine and the  <br>00:45:15.280 more glucose roller coaster you have  <br>00:45:17.119 going on the lower your tyrosine levels  <br>00:45:19.440 and tyrosine balances our mood so the  <br>00:45:22.599 food you eat can impact your marriage  <br>00:45:25.480 can impact how you show up  <br>00:45:27.640 with others can impact how you feel  <br>00:45:30.160 about other people's behavior it goes  <br>00:45:32.079 really deep it's not just about diabetes  <br>00:45:34.559 it it impacts who you are as a person  <br>00:45:36.559 your personality so if I stop eating  <br>00:45:38.680 sugar it will save my marriage I mean  <br>00:45:41.200 you said  <br>00:45:43.079 it it's not it's really interesting I  <br>00:45:45.040 was thinking as you were talking as well  <br>00:45:46.240 about how glucose is linked to our sort  <br>00:45:51.240 of discipline more broadly you know you  <br>00:45:53.839 were talking earlier about parents and  <br>00:45:55.559 them being able to be more sort of  <br>00:45:56.599 disciplined and strict with and calm  <br>00:46:00.119 when they themselves get their glucose  <br>00:46:02.000 under control but you think about all of  <br>00:46:03.359 our lives our lives are shaped by the  <br>00:46:04.760 habits that we perform consistently and  <br>00:46:06.680 for us to have good um habits that are  <br>00:46:10.000 prod conducive with our health our  <br>00:46:12.480 happiness our success then we need to be  <br>00:46:15.240 focused and disciplined and be able to  <br>00:46:17.000 reach for the right things um whether  <br>00:46:19.240 it's a dumbbell or whether it's our  <br>00:46:21.160 laptop yeah so like do do you ever think  <br>00:46:23.599 much about the role that glucose plays  <br>00:46:25.200 with our sort of discipline to be who we  <br>00:46:27.079 want to be to sh up how we want to sh up  <br>00:46:28.680 completely because so many people are  <br>00:46:30.520 stuck in a cycle of being a victim to  <br>00:46:33.079 their Cravings being a victim to their  <br>00:46:34.599 fatigue and they can't show up as the  <br>00:46:36.440 person they want to be and if you switch  <br>00:46:39.599 your diet and use these hacks you can  <br>00:46:42.079 actually be more connected to the  <br>00:46:44.079 version of yourself that you want to be  <br>00:46:45.920 and even just a simple thing like a  <br>00:46:47.200 Savory breakfast it can deeply change  <br>00:46:49.960 how you show up throughout your day  <br>00:46:52.280 instead of being exhausted at 11:00 a.m.  <br>00:46:55.160 needing four coffees feeling this  <br>00:46:56.920 lethargic in your work meeting then at 3  <br>00:46:59.040 p.m. thinking oh I really want to have a  <br>00:47:00.640 nap I would have a nap on the floor  <br>00:47:02.000 right here if I could looking for sugar  <br>00:47:03.839 all the time you actually have a clearer  <br>00:47:05.680 brain like we know glucose spikes are  <br>00:47:07.440 linked to even just brain fog and brain  <br>00:47:09.680 fog is a debilitating symptom to have  <br>00:47:12.440 you can't show up as the person you want  <br>00:47:14.559 to be I would never be able to do the  <br>00:47:16.160 work that I do if I didn't have my  <br>00:47:17.960 glucose under control and I learned that  <br>00:47:19.800 from the very beginning that's why I got  <br>00:47:21.119 into this work in the first place but  <br>00:47:23.200 100% agree with you yeah so the first  <br>00:47:25.839 hack we talked about was the Savory  <br>00:47:27.839 breakfast there was the second one you  <br>00:47:29.040 talked about vinegar which we talked  <br>00:47:30.280 about last time which I remember I was  <br>00:47:31.440 really repulsed by but you count this as  <br>00:47:33.680 one of your most important hacks is to  <br>00:47:36.319 eat vinegar every day it's drink one  <br>00:47:38.480 tablespoon of vinegar in a big glass of  <br>00:47:40.319 water before your biggest meal of the  <br>00:47:42.440 day and the reason it's important  <br>00:47:43.599 Stephen is because it's easy and I'm all  <br>00:47:45.960 about easy hacks big bang for your bck  <br>00:47:48.720 so vinegar contains acetic acid which  <br>00:47:51.640 interacts with your digestive enzymes  <br>00:47:53.680 and cuts the glucose Spike of your meal  <br>00:47:55.440 by up to 30% with no effort so if you  <br>00:47:58.280 want a super low effort albeit not very  <br>00:48:01.040 delicious super low effort hack to try  <br>00:48:03.800 do that and see how you feel with a  <br>00:48:06.480 smaller Spike and a smaller crash few  <br>00:48:08.559 Cravings less fatigue what kind of  <br>00:48:10.440 vinegar any kind of vinegar it can be  <br>00:48:12.680 the vinegar you have at home literally  <br>00:48:14.079 tonight just grab the white vinegar in  <br>00:48:16.319 your kitchen and not the cleaning  <br>00:48:17.640 vinegar if it's next to the toilet paper  <br>00:48:19.079 it's not the right vinegar you want the  <br>00:48:20.800 kitchen vinegar one tablespoon in a big  <br>00:48:23.079 glass of water dilute it drink it 10  <br>00:48:25.079 minutes before having your dinner see  <br>00:48:26.440 how you feel what's what role is the  <br>00:48:28.079 water playing in this just dilution so  <br>00:48:30.520 that it doesn't hurt your teeth because  <br>00:48:32.280 your dentist won't be very happy if you  <br>00:48:34.240 take a shot of vinegar because it can  <br>00:48:35.520 hurt your teeth's enamel okay so that's  <br>00:48:38.240 hack number two and that's really to  <br>00:48:39.640 sort of line my stomach to so no that's  <br>00:48:42.800 to interact with your digestive enzymes  <br>00:48:44.960 the line stomach is the third hack which  <br>00:48:46.960 is Veggie starters so all around the  <br>00:48:49.640 world if you look at different cultures  <br>00:48:51.160 you see this habit this tradition of  <br>00:48:53.440 starting your meal with veggies in Italy  <br>00:48:56.160 aunti  <br>00:48:57.359 in France crud raw vegetables at the end  <br>00:49:00.359 of your at the beginning of your meal in  <br>00:49:02.200 the Middle East you start your meals  <br>00:49:04.119 with herbs by the bunch right why are we  <br>00:49:07.319 doing this veggies first thing well  <br>00:49:09.559 recently scientists have discovered why  <br>00:49:11.040 it's so powerful it's because veggies  <br>00:49:13.520 contain fiber we love fiber she's the  <br>00:49:16.760 best when you have fiber at the  <br>00:49:18.480 beginning of a meal what it does is that  <br>00:49:20.359 it coats your intestine it makes this  <br>00:49:22.440 sort of protective barrier this  <br>00:49:24.960 protective mesh kind of goo fibrous mesh  <br>00:49:28.720 and so any glucose you eat afterwards  <br>00:49:31.400 will not be able to go through your  <br>00:49:33.839 intestine into your bloodstream so  <br>00:49:35.680 quickly so it slows down the arrival of  <br>00:49:38.040 glucose into your blood and it slows  <br>00:49:40.079 down that Spike you can make the  <br>00:49:42.119 experiment if you're wearing a monitor  <br>00:49:44.359 just have a a small plate of you know  <br>00:49:47.240 carrots or spinach or broccoli or cherry  <br>00:49:49.280 tomatoes or whatever veggie you like  <br>00:49:51.160 before a meal and see how much smaller  <br>00:49:53.000 your glucose spike is you stay Fuller  <br>00:49:55.359 for longer have few crat and you're  <br>00:49:57.200 helping your body from within too and  <br>00:49:59.559 the fourth one you mentioned was moving  <br>00:50:01.440 after after eating yeah so after eating  <br>00:50:05.240 use your body and your muscles for 10  <br>00:50:07.200 minutes you can clean your apartment go  <br>00:50:10.319 for a walk with your dog dance to a few  <br>00:50:12.680 songs if you're at the office you can do  <br>00:50:15.240 calf raises under your desk like this so  <br>00:50:17.200 you just sort of push up onto the balls  <br>00:50:18.920 of your feet up and down for 10 minutes  <br>00:50:20.960 nobody will see and your calves contain  <br>00:50:23.559 a muscle called the Solus muscle which  <br>00:50:25.240 is really good at soaking up glucose but  <br>00:50:27.559 it's what we were talking about earlier  <br>00:50:28.839 Stephen your muscles are really  <br>00:50:31.000 effective glucose dumps and the more you  <br>00:50:33.119 use them to contract the more they're  <br>00:50:34.920 going to soak up glucose from your  <br>00:50:36.520 bloodstream to use for energy so that's  <br>00:50:39.400 the four hacks Savory breakfast vinegar  <br>00:50:42.119 once a day veggie starter once a day you  <br>00:50:44.319 can also combine those two and do like a  <br>00:50:46.599 vinegar dressing on a veggie starter and  <br>00:50:49.319 then moving after eating and then when  <br>00:50:51.200 you want to get Pro you go to all my  <br>00:50:52.480 other hacks people talk about being in a  <br>00:50:54.240 food comr after they've eaten yeah which  <br>00:50:56.640 which is I mean the antithesis of what  <br>00:50:58.040 you're you're saying absolutely food  <br>00:51:00.520 coma is like a combination of brain fog  <br>00:51:02.119 and fatigue right and what's going on  <br>00:51:04.200 there well I think there's a lot of  <br>00:51:06.000 things going on but one study that's  <br>00:51:07.520 really interesting shows us that in rats  <br>00:51:10.839 when you create lots of big glucose  <br>00:51:12.839 spikes and when you monitor the activity  <br>00:51:15.040 of their neurons in the rats scientists  <br>00:51:17.480 noticed that the more glucose spikes  <br>00:51:19.400 they had the slower the speed of the  <br>00:51:23.440 signal between their neurons so their  <br>00:51:25.799 brain was literally slowing down the  <br>00:51:28.960 information was going more slowly  <br>00:51:31.000 throughout the brain and they're the  <br>00:51:32.400 they theorized that in humans this could  <br>00:51:34.440 lead to brain fog so you have glucose  <br>00:51:36.799 spikes linked to brain fog and your  <br>00:51:39.079 mitochondria becoming exhausted from Big  <br>00:51:41.720 glucose spikes potentially making you  <br>00:51:43.839 really tired you know 90 minutes after  <br>00:51:45.640 eating with the hack food coma reduced  <br>00:51:49.079 significantly so you can actually do  <br>00:51:50.839 stuff after eating instead of just being  <br>00:51:53.119 lying down and not being able to get up  <br>00:51:55.960 and you took these hacks and you did an  <br>00:51:57.920 experiment right on page seven of your  <br>00:52:00.640 book the glucose goddess  <br>00:52:03.440 method you talk about this 2,700 person  <br>00:52:07.040 pilot experiment that you did in 2019  <br>00:52:10.599 yeah which of the hacks did you use for  <br>00:52:13.000 this experiment and what did you find so  <br>00:52:15.040 it was these four hacks so it was a  <br>00:52:16.720 four-week experiment week one you start  <br>00:52:19.480 your Savory breakfast every day you do  <br>00:52:21.559 that for the four weeks week two you add  <br>00:52:24.160 in vinegar once a day you continue for  <br>00:52:26.520 for the rest of the three weeks week  <br>00:52:28.240 three you add veggie starters and week  <br>00:52:30.079 four you add moving after eating you  <br>00:52:33.040 don't have to change anything else about  <br>00:52:34.799 what you're eating I'm not cutting out  <br>00:52:36.599 sugar I'm not telling you to not drink  <br>00:52:38.280 alcohol I'm not telling you to not drink  <br>00:52:39.559 pasta I'm just asking you to add these  <br>00:52:42.200 for hacks in and see what happens and  <br>00:52:45.440 these people were from 110 countries  <br>00:52:47.559 yeah I recruited I recruited them online  <br>00:52:49.760 on through Instagram between the ages of  <br>00:52:51.799 20 and 70 years old mhm and what  <br>00:52:55.160 happened listen the results were really  <br>00:52:57.520 stunning so 90% of people reduced their  <br>00:52:59.799 Cravings 90% of people had more energy  <br>00:53:02.160 you had really significant impacts on  <br>00:53:04.040 sleep on hormones on skin on mood on  <br>00:53:08.400 Diabetes I mean of course this is not a  <br>00:53:11.119 you know Placebo controlled randomized  <br>00:53:13.200 trial it's just an experiment I didn't  <br>00:53:15.079 have a control group but these numbers  <br>00:53:17.400 are pretty remarkable and that's what I  <br>00:53:19.359 see when I meet people when I see the  <br>00:53:21.400 testimonials from my readers so just  <br>00:53:23.520 very quick impact because glucose spikes  <br>00:53:26.240 imp act all parts of our system physical  <br>00:53:29.799 and mental and when you balance them  <br>00:53:31.400 Stephen you're creating a much better  <br>00:53:33.559 foundation for your body and your mind  <br>00:53:36.079 to be healthy and these are  <br>00:53:37.640 self-reported symptoms right totally  <br>00:53:39.240 yeah so we did a survey at the end of  <br>00:53:41.240 every of the four weeks and uh just  <br>00:53:43.599 measured the results and when you say  <br>00:53:46.200 there's no control group that means that  <br>00:53:48.440 there wasn't another group who weren't  <br>00:53:50.960 who were doing like a different kind of  <br>00:53:52.760 intervention or Placebo no okay so it  <br>00:53:54.960 was just 3,000 people doing the hacks  <br>00:53:57.240 and I was just asking them questions uh  <br>00:53:59.680 at the end and it says here 40% roughly  <br>00:54:02.000 40% of people who wanted to lose weight  <br>00:54:03.680 did in fact lose weight in those four  <br>00:54:05.040 weeks yeah with no calorie restriction  <br>00:54:07.680 no request to eat less and the reason  <br>00:54:11.400 this is interesting is that even though  <br>00:54:13.200 weight loss is not the primary objective  <br>00:54:15.359 of balancing your glucose levels what  <br>00:54:17.400 happens when you reduce your spikes is  <br>00:54:19.799 that you reduce Cravings because you're  <br>00:54:21.760 not activating that craving Center  <br>00:54:23.319 anymore you reduce hunger you have more  <br>00:54:25.799 energy to potentially move more and you  <br>00:54:28.839 lower your insulin levels now this is  <br>00:54:30.920 very important because when there's  <br>00:54:32.480 insulin present in your body you cannot  <br>00:54:34.799 burn fat insulin is storing fat and  <br>00:54:38.240 making more fat and when you lower  <br>00:54:40.520 insulin you can actually burn some of  <br>00:54:42.760 the fat that you stored and there's  <br>00:54:44.799 going to be people screaming because  <br>00:54:45.799 they want to know the other sort of six  <br>00:54:47.680 this 10 right yeah I can go through all  <br>00:54:49.400 of them if you want sit the other six AR  <br>00:54:51.839 of course of course of course so another  <br>00:54:54.359 hack is eating your food in the right  <br>00:54:56.799 now this is kind of similar to the  <br>00:54:58.440 veggie starter it's just a bit more  <br>00:55:00.280 complicated and it's really where the  <br>00:55:02.119 science it's really what the science  <br>00:55:03.960 shows us the science shows us that if  <br>00:55:06.400 you eat a meal in the right order  <br>00:55:08.280 meaning veggies first then proteins and  <br>00:55:11.559 fats then starches and sugars instead of  <br>00:55:14.480 the opposite you reduce the glucose  <br>00:55:16.400 Spike of the meal by up to  <br>00:55:18.559 75% you're eating the same meal the same  <br>00:55:22.440 quantity the same food just the order  <br>00:55:24.480 and using that fiber first mentality  <br>00:55:26.920 is going to reduce your Spike  <br>00:55:28.559 significantly just to be clear this  <br>00:55:29.680 doesn't mean that I'm going to gain less  <br>00:55:31.799 weight from that  <br>00:55:33.520 meal well no because it doesn't H you  <br>00:55:36.039 know weight loss doesn't happen within  <br>00:55:37.559 one specific meal but it does mean  <br>00:55:39.359 you'll have fewer Cravings a couple  <br>00:55:41.079 hours after that meal so maybe you won't  <br>00:55:42.680 reach for the donut okay that's how it  <br>00:55:44.680 would work so indirectly I might not  <br>00:55:46.520 game more away exactly exactly so eating  <br>00:55:49.520 your food in the right order okay having  <br>00:55:51.880 a Savory breakfast we talked about it  <br>00:55:54.000 veggies first we talked about it vinegar  <br>00:55:56.520 we talked about it moving after eating  <br>00:55:57.799 we talked about it and then there's  <br>00:55:58.920 clothes on  <br>00:56:00.119 carbs so that means anytime you eat  <br>00:56:03.119 starches or sugars which are the big  <br>00:56:05.280 category of carbs make sure you're never  <br>00:56:07.280 eating them naked or on their own  <br>00:56:10.960 because if you eat them on their own  <br>00:56:13.400 plof they just turn into glucose really  <br>00:56:15.200 really quickly so instead of having a  <br>00:56:16.480 slice of bread on its own have bread and  <br>00:56:19.039 some avocado add some fat to that that's  <br>00:56:21.640 a good clothing to add or add some  <br>00:56:23.440 protein or add some Fiber if you're  <br>00:56:25.119 having a carrot cake don't have it on  <br>00:56:27.280 its own have it with a Greek yogurt for  <br>00:56:29.480 example so that's clothes on carbs it's  <br>00:56:33.839 really easy to remember especially if  <br>00:56:36.599 you're going throughout your day and you  <br>00:56:37.839 can't really pick what you're eating  <br>00:56:39.440 because you don't have many options just  <br>00:56:40.760 think clothes on carbs then we have  <br>00:56:43.119 Savory  <br>00:56:44.240 snacks so during a day if you want to  <br>00:56:46.920 have a snack between meals when your  <br>00:56:49.039 stomach is empty try to have something  <br>00:56:51.280 Savory that won't increase your glucose  <br>00:56:53.440 spikes instead of having something sweet  <br>00:56:56.760 then another hack that we kind of  <br>00:56:57.920 touched on is if you want to eat  <br>00:57:00.119 something sweet have it as dessert  <br>00:57:02.400 instead of on an empty stomach so if I  <br>00:57:04.359 want a cookie or a carrot cake I will  <br>00:57:06.319 make sure to buy it in the morning if I  <br>00:57:07.880 know where I want to get it from and  <br>00:57:08.960 then have it as dessert after my lunch  <br>00:57:10.839 or after my dinner so I'm not removing  <br>00:57:13.880 any of the sugar from your life I'm just  <br>00:57:15.960 showing you how and when to eat it so it  <br>00:57:18.720 will reduce the glucose Spike and then  <br>00:57:21.000 we have always eat your fruit whole  <br>00:57:23.720 never Juiced never dried never smoothed  <br>00:57:26.920 only whole to have that protective fiber  <br>00:57:29.200 in there thinking about your Instagram  <br>00:57:32.079 you post these photos of glucose spikes  <br>00:57:33.920 with um in response to different foods  <br>00:57:35.920 how do you trial that is that oh great  <br>00:57:38.319 question are those your spikes yeah  <br>00:57:40.039 those are my spikes or the spikes from  <br>00:57:41.480 somebody on my team but it's really  <br>00:57:42.799 important to note that these spikes are  <br>00:57:46.119 just  <br>00:57:46.920 illustrating studies trials that have  <br>00:57:49.520 been done by scientists around the world  <br>00:57:51.000 so for example I'll find a clinical  <br>00:57:52.960 trial showing that vinegar before a meal  <br>00:57:55.079 reduces a glucose Spike it's been shown  <br>00:57:57.039 at scale with a placebo you know proper  <br>00:57:59.799 clinical study and I'll just make an  <br>00:58:02.000 example with my own data to illustrate  <br>00:58:04.799 that scientific study and that's why if  <br>00:58:06.599 you swipe on my post you'll see my graph  <br>00:58:08.799 and then the study that I mentioned or  <br>00:58:10.200 in the description of the post I don't  <br>00:58:12.280 draw any conclusions from my own glucose  <br>00:58:14.400 data I'm not like oh look today I had a  <br>00:58:16.880 green tea and that didn't cause a spike  <br>00:58:18.359 and yesterday I had a green tea and I  <br>00:58:19.760 also had a piece of I don't know  <br>00:58:21.119 whatever an almond and that caused a  <br>00:58:23.160 biggest [ __ ] so I should be telling  <br>00:58:25.160 everybody to not have elments like  <br>00:58:26.640 that's not how it works at all it's just  <br>00:58:28.720 an illustration of existing studies  <br>00:58:30.960 that's my role that's my job that's what  <br>00:58:32.319 I love to do to translate studies that  <br>00:58:34.440 are existing in a way that makes it  <br>00:58:37.440 easier for people to understand because  <br>00:58:39.240 you can't just give somebody a  <br>00:58:41.400 scientific paper you have to explain it  <br>00:58:44.039 in a visual way that they can  <br>00:58:45.839 immediately get it so of those visuals  <br>00:58:49.200 that you've made is there some in  <br>00:58:52.280 particular that were most surprising to  <br>00:58:53.920 you or most shocking to you because I'm  <br>00:58:55.200 going to put some of them on the screen  <br>00:58:56.720 so some of them that come to mind that  <br>00:58:58.280 would maybe had the biggest response  <br>00:59:01.000 from your audience for example yeah I  <br>00:59:03.480 think some of the ones that show  <br>00:59:04.960 traditional food combinations and how  <br>00:59:06.559 they're actually good for our glucose  <br>00:59:07.760 levels are fascinating for example  <br>00:59:09.720 grapes and cheese so I'm French and  <br>00:59:12.400 often when you eat like a big uh plateau  <br>00:59:15.119 of cheese you'll have some grapes there  <br>00:59:16.559 to have with and it you know the glucose  <br>00:59:19.039 response shows us that if we had the  <br>00:59:20.359 grape on its own it would be a bigger  <br>00:59:22.280 Spike than the grape with the cheese not  <br>00:59:24.319 only is it really delicious it's Al  <br>00:59:26.280 better for your glucose levels because  <br>00:59:27.480 you're putting clothing on that sugary  <br>00:59:29.799 carb that is the piece of fruit or ham  <br>00:59:33.880 and melon or rice and beans all these  <br>00:59:37.359 traditional combinations cause smaller  <br>00:59:40.039 spikes than you would expect from the  <br>00:59:41.799 individual ingredients that's really  <br>00:59:43.920 quite fascinating in terms of the most  <br>00:59:46.400 um shocking ones I think  <br>00:59:48.760 any glucose graph showing food order is  <br>00:59:52.559 really interesting so for example if you  <br>00:59:54.280 have salad and then then pasta which is  <br>00:59:57.640 much better for your glucose levels than  <br>00:59:59.359 having pasta and then the salad  <br>01:00:01.880 interesting yeah and that's the food  <br>01:00:03.240 order hack going on do you know off the  <br>01:00:06.440 top of your head what your most engaged  <br>01:00:08.960 post has been of all time the one that's  <br>01:00:10.920 been shared the most or commented on the  <br>01:00:12.359 most um actually it's one currently at  <br>01:00:15.640 least on YouTube it's one where I  <br>01:00:17.280 explain where I show an image of an  <br>01:00:19.440 ancestral banana what bananas used to  <br>01:00:21.960 actually look like in nature and what  <br>01:00:24.319 bananas look like today to illustrate  <br>01:00:26.000 that the fruit that you find today in  <br>01:00:27.160 the supermarket is not natural so that's  <br>01:00:30.160 a very very popular one and then I think  <br>01:00:32.280 it's the hacks um it's the glucose  <br>01:00:34.960 graphs and the videos where I explain  <br>01:00:36.280 food order people really love that it's  <br>01:00:38.480 so interesting to see that if you have  <br>01:00:41.839 your veggies at the beginning of a meal  <br>01:00:43.559 you have such a big impact on your  <br>01:00:45.520 glucose levels whereas we've all been  <br>01:00:47.160 taught that all your food mixes in your  <br>01:00:49.319 stomach and mixes like big smoothie and  <br>01:00:51.039 it doesn't matter well it does  <br>01:00:53.359 actually yeah that because that's really  <br>01:00:56.000 easy to change as well totally you don't  <br>01:00:57.799 have to change what you're eating how  <br>01:00:59.799 much you're eating just next time you're  <br>01:01:02.000 sat at a meal think oh I'm going to have  <br>01:01:04.280 the veggies on my plate first that's it  <br>01:01:07.559 so powerful these hacks are so easy  <br>01:01:10.640 Stephen I really want everybody to know  <br>01:01:12.160 them I want to become irrelevant I don't  <br>01:01:13.880 want to have any more work because  <br>01:01:15.359 everybody knows these hacks it's so  <br>01:01:17.200 important for our Public Health I think  <br>01:01:19.599 some uh vinegar has arrived for you to  <br>01:01:21.280 shot yeah no we can't shot it Stephen we  <br>01:01:23.559 have to dilute it I'm I'll dilute it as  <br>01:01:25.599 well let  <br>01:01:28.680 for yes so this is side of vinegar but  <br>01:01:32.160 any vinegar works you don't have to buy  <br>01:01:33.680 expensive vinegar it doesn't have to be  <br>01:01:35.240 organic unfiltered whatever just kitchen  <br>01:01:37.359 vinegar works no I try it straight I've  <br>01:01:40.119 actually never really drink okay but if  <br>01:01:41.599 you're dentist is upset it's not my  <br>01:01:42.839 fault okay  <br>01:01:45.920 well so Jesse told me to drink this  <br>01:01:48.839 straight no she's an expert she said  <br>01:01:51.200 she's a scientist  <br>01:01:57.599 oh  <br>01:01:59.880 gosh yeah you're not supposed to do that  <br>01:02:01.960 Stephen no I'm  <br>01:02:03.359 sorry no it's been really lovely getting  <br>01:02:05.599 to imagine if but it's not that bad but  <br>01:02:09.520 it's not something that I would do for  <br>01:02:11.079 fun yeah but also if you want to have  <br>01:02:12.760 vinegar straight you need to get higher  <br>01:02:14.160 quality vinegar there's some vinegars  <br>01:02:15.640 that taste really really good but in our  <br>01:02:17.799 case we're just trying to get the acetic  <br>01:02:19.559 acid and we don't need high quality  <br>01:02:21.039 expensive vinegar we can just do like  <br>01:02:22.400 really cheap  <br>01:02:23.359 vinegar and this is a we just put one  <br>01:02:25.480 tbspoon this is a good hack if you have  <br>01:02:27.240 a parent that has diabetes and they  <br>01:02:29.200 don't want to change anything about  <br>01:02:30.319 their lifestyle just get them to add  <br>01:02:32.160 this before their meals when they're  <br>01:02:33.160 eating carbs and you'll see a good  <br>01:02:34.319 impact on their glucos levels okay so  <br>01:02:36.119 I'm mixing it like this you didn't put  <br>01:02:37.880 much in there I put a tablespoon it's a  <br>01:02:41.839 tablespoon and even that small amount  <br>01:02:44.119 you L it looked like you you kind of  <br>01:02:45.520 filled the lid I fill the lid twice  <br>01:02:47.279 basically which is approximately one  <br>01:02:49.400 tablespoon I think cuz this is probably  <br>01:02:51.880 like yeah this is half a tablespoon I  <br>01:02:54.920 would say okay I've done this  <br>01:02:56.799 before and now you can't taste  <br>01:03:01.119 anything you're telling me that that  <br>01:03:03.039 will have an impact absolutely and the  <br>01:03:04.520 studies prove it I can't taste anything  <br>01:03:06.799 yeah maybe because I just had the big  <br>01:03:08.160 shot I think that's probably why but but  <br>01:03:11.400 totally Stephen I even meet people on  <br>01:03:13.520 the street or like my readers and stuff  <br>01:03:15.079 and they'll show me that in their purse  <br>01:03:16.440 they have a little um bottle of vinegar  <br>01:03:18.640 they take with them it's super easy and  <br>01:03:21.000 you know I was very skeptical and I  <br>01:03:22.279 think everybody was super skeptical  <br>01:03:23.680 about the vinegar thing until the  <br>01:03:25.799 studies were widely read it's it's an  <br>01:03:28.680 amazing ingredient that's been used for  <br>01:03:31.079 Millennia for its health benefits but  <br>01:03:33.279 now we understand how it works it has  <br>01:03:35.119 impact on visceral fat on cholesterol  <br>01:03:37.359 levels on glucose and on insulin levels  <br>01:03:39.319 it's a magical ingredient it's super  <br>01:03:41.039 cheap so have some vinegar but be very  <br>01:03:43.640 careful now a lot of big brands are  <br>01:03:45.559 jumping on this and are making vinegar  <br>01:03:47.039 drinks that have sugar in them so you  <br>01:03:48.960 want straight vinegar you don't want  <br>01:03:50.319 anything that has even a tiny bit of  <br>01:03:51.920 apple juice or sugar uhuhuh straight  <br>01:03:54.359 vinegar  <br>01:03:56.319 you said visceral fat yeah is that belly  <br>01:03:58.319 fat yeah it's the fat between your  <br>01:04:00.000 organs it's the fat that's really bad  <br>01:04:02.079 for you so you can have fat that is sort  <br>01:04:04.680 of on the outside of your body and you  <br>01:04:06.160 can you can grab it you know you can  <br>01:04:08.319 grab it and you can really pinch it  <br>01:04:09.920 speak for yourself no I totally have  <br>01:04:12.160 nice fat here that I can grab yeah yeah  <br>01:04:14.279 so this fat you know I can grab visceral  <br>01:04:17.160 fat is underneath my muscle layer and  <br>01:04:20.160 you would know if somebody has visceral  <br>01:04:21.799 fat if they have kind of a big hard  <br>01:04:24.200 belly have you ever seen that and they  <br>01:04:26.480 just kind of but if you touch it you  <br>01:04:28.039 can't make it into a roll that's  <br>01:04:30.039 visceral fat that's between your organs  <br>01:04:31.400 and that's really bad for you so vinegar  <br>01:04:33.000 helps of course this is not a magic  <br>01:04:35.079 solution that's going to fix all your  <br>01:04:36.960 issues and you know prevent ton of  <br>01:04:39.160 diseases it's a good Ally to have and  <br>01:04:41.720 I'm all about little allies you bring  <br>01:04:43.920 with you Gentle Giants you have  <br>01:04:45.440 throughout your day that are going to  <br>01:04:46.720 help you get to Health in an easy  <br>01:04:48.319 manageable way so so if I have that  <br>01:04:51.079 glass that you've just made for me which  <br>01:04:52.640 basically I can't taste the vinegar in  <br>01:04:54.160 because it's been dilated by water and  <br>01:04:56.400 then I eat something yeah remind me  <br>01:04:58.559 again of the impact that that will have  <br>01:04:59.760 on my glucose Spike so it'll reduce your  <br>01:05:03.079 glucose Spike by up to 30% and your  <br>01:05:05.359 insulin Spike also by up to 30% the way  <br>01:05:08.240 it works is that you have these little  <br>01:05:11.400 scissors in your stomach like miniature  <br>01:05:15.359 scissors called enzymes their job is to  <br>01:05:18.440 chop up the starches and sugars and turn  <br>01:05:20.920 them into individual glucose molecules  <br>01:05:22.920 it's a part of your digestive process  <br>01:05:24.960 these enzymes  <br>01:05:26.200 do this  <br>01:05:27.799 job vinegar will temporarily inactivate  <br>01:05:31.880 some of those little scissors  <br>01:05:33.119 essentially slowing down how quickly the  <br>01:05:36.039 glucose arrives into your bloodstream  <br>01:05:38.520 it's all about velocity we're all about  <br>01:05:41.200 trying to reduce the speed of arrival of  <br>01:05:43.920 glucose into your bloodstream that's the  <br>01:05:46.440 key so vinegar is a really effective way  <br>01:05:48.880 of doing this one of the things that I  <br>01:05:51.160 read online as well about glucose and  <br>01:05:52.839 again this is like conspiracy theories  <br>01:05:55.079 that are  <br>01:05:56.480 I read this is a variation of the Tweet  <br>01:05:59.279 um I'll read it out it says sugar in a  <br>01:06:02.520 baby's brain is called ADHD sugar in  <br>01:06:06.279 adult's brain is called dementia and  <br>01:06:07.960 Alzheimer's sugar in your eyes is called  <br>01:06:10.720 glycom sugar in your teeth is called  <br>01:06:13.000 cavities sugar on your skin is called  <br>01:06:15.240 Aging sugar in your sleep is called  <br>01:06:17.720 insomnia sugar in your blood is called  <br>01:06:20.799 diabetes sugar on Wall Street is called  <br>01:06:24.000 a billion dollar industry boom I get the  <br>01:06:27.480 point I think sugar is definitely one of  <br>01:06:30.000 the main drivers of all these things but  <br>01:06:32.520 there's other stuff going on of course  <br>01:06:33.839 but I like that I think the Alzheimer's  <br>01:06:35.440 one is really interesting to talk  <br>01:06:37.760 about there's a study that has followed  <br>01:06:40.880 people for 30 years and they found that  <br>01:06:45.240 people who had elevated glucose levels  <br>01:06:47.599 in their 40s were more likely to get  <br>01:06:50.920 Alzheimer's when they reach 60 70 80 so  <br>01:06:55.720 having high glucose levels at midlife is  <br>01:06:57.680 a risk factor for Alzheimer's when  <br>01:06:59.880 you're older not only that but  <br>01:07:01.960 scientists have started to see that some  <br>01:07:03.480 of the things you see in the brain of  <br>01:07:05.760 someone with Alzheimer's are actually  <br>01:07:07.520 similar to what you see in the body of  <br>01:07:10.240 somebody with diabetes namely  <br>01:07:13.359 inflammation glycation and insulin  <br>01:07:17.400 resistance so much so that some  <br>01:07:19.960 scientists call Alzheimer's type 3  <br>01:07:23.960 diabetes diabetes of the  <br>01:07:26.720 brain pretty freaking fascinating  <br>01:07:30.279 there's going to be so many people that  <br>01:07:31.760 are listening to our conversation when  <br>01:07:33.279 we talked about PCOS or Alzheimer's or  <br>01:07:36.200 all these kinds of things I think like  <br>01:07:38.480 how how is it fair that I've got these  <br>01:07:41.119 conditions when I don't even eat as much  <br>01:07:43.279 sugar as most people yeah you know they  <br>01:07:45.720 probably look at someone who is really  <br>01:07:47.799 binging out on sugar who doesn't have  <br>01:07:50.119 any of these things if I was a woman and  <br>01:07:51.839 I had PCOS and I ate just a little bit  <br>01:07:55.960 of sugar I'd be like this is not fair  <br>01:07:58.079 and a second ago when you said at 40 if  <br>01:07:59.640 you have elevated gluc glucose levels is  <br>01:08:03.079 that relative to like or is that to your  <br>01:08:06.920 response no they're looking at fasting  <br>01:08:09.240 glucose so a measure of a how diabetic  <br>01:08:11.839 you are essentially if you're healthy  <br>01:08:13.760 pre-diabetic or diabetic so it's not  <br>01:08:15.359 looking at the spikes it's looking at  <br>01:08:17.238 your Baseline in the morning which is  <br>01:08:18.799 what doctors measure with a blood test  <br>01:08:21.120 oh okay yeah yeah but Stephen life is  <br>01:08:23.960 unfair like I  <br>01:08:26.120 my glucose spikes led to terrible mental  <br>01:08:29.560 health episodes of depersonalization  <br>01:08:31.839 lots of people I know eat so much sugar  <br>01:08:33.759 all the time have never had one mental  <br>01:08:35.238 health issue in their life I like I  <br>01:08:37.439 don't have all the answers to that we  <br>01:08:39.120 just know that on average if you look at  <br>01:08:41.158 everybody by reducing those spikes  <br>01:08:42.960 you're going to reduce the likelihood of  <br>01:08:44.759 these diseases but you see people who  <br>01:08:46.439 like smoke two packs of cigarettes a day  <br>01:08:48.759 drink two liters of orange juice and  <br>01:08:50.399 live to 120 with no health issues and  <br>01:08:52.719 you have people who are perfectly  <br>01:08:54.120 healthy who get cancer at 25 and die  <br>01:08:56.640 like I'm not God I don't know but what I  <br>01:08:59.600 do know is that in a lot of cases when  <br>01:09:02.120 you have a condition that's linked to  <br>01:09:03.399 glucose levels and you apply these hacks  <br>01:09:05.238 you can get relief or remission that's  <br>01:09:07.198 all I know are there any societies where  <br>01:09:09.359 they just don't really eat sugar that  <br>01:09:11.640 you you can think of or any sort of I  <br>01:09:14.640 think any any culture any country that's  <br>01:09:16.880 been globalized and now has access to  <br>01:09:18.600 like fizzy drinks and stuff it's so  <br>01:09:19.960 addictive that stuff as soon as you  <br>01:09:21.479 introduce it somewhere everybody starts  <br>01:09:22.960 drinking it I'd love to do a continuous  <br>01:09:25.520 glucose monitor on like the heads a  <br>01:09:26.880 tribe or something in Africa and see  <br>01:09:28.839 amazing if they're like inflammation  <br>01:09:30.839 levels and stuff yeah I would do  <br>01:09:32.399 continous glucose monitor but also  <br>01:09:33.880 fasting glucose levels right to just  <br>01:09:35.640 kind of see what their Baseline is at do  <br>01:09:37.520 any of them have diabetes pre-diabetes  <br>01:09:39.799 or not at all what's going on but yeah I  <br>01:09:41.560 agree it's fascinating you mentioned a  <br>01:09:43.319 term earlier that I've only ever heard  <br>01:09:44.600 used when talking about a zmek glp1 yeah  <br>01:09:48.439 what what relationship does glucose have  <br>01:09:50.198 with gp1s and what the hell is a  <br>01:09:53.120 glp1 it's so interesting so  <br>01:09:55.960 in your digestive system you have these  <br>01:09:57.520 little cells they're called L cells and  <br>01:10:00.120 they're like little sensors and they  <br>01:10:01.960 just hang out there in your digestive  <br>01:10:03.520 tract just like chilling and doing  <br>01:10:05.040 nothing and then as soon as you eat and  <br>01:10:07.640 they sense food they wake up they're  <br>01:10:10.159 like alert we have a job to do and their  <br>01:10:12.960 job is to release a substance called  <br>01:10:16.920 glp1 this  <br>01:10:18.960 substance then goes to different parts  <br>01:10:21.120 of your body and tells you that you've  <br>01:10:22.840 eaten enough food and you can stop  <br>01:10:24.480 eating so for example you're having a  <br>01:10:26.440 big plate of  <br>01:10:27.640 pasta the starch goes into your  <br>01:10:30.239 digestive system the little L cells  <br>01:10:32.239 sense the pasta they're like oh we've  <br>01:10:33.800 eaten food and then it tells your brain  <br>01:10:35.880 Stephen you can stop eating you don't  <br>01:10:37.280 have to eat another five pounds of pasta  <br>01:10:39.280 you're satiated M and you become less  <br>01:10:41.560 hungry not only that but glp1 also helps  <br>01:10:45.360 your body deal with that glucose spike  <br>01:10:47.679 it says alert glucose is here let's put  <br>01:10:50.320 some of that glucose away into liver  <br>01:10:53.120 muscle and fat cells so glp1  <br>01:10:55.800 is a totally normal part of our  <br>01:10:58.679 physiology it's been there forever we  <br>01:11:00.560 all have it but recently it's been kind  <br>01:11:03.600 of  <br>01:11:05.719 um just taking advantage of so there  <br>01:11:08.199 were scientists and Pharma companies who  <br>01:11:09.920 said hey this gp1 thing is pretty cool  <br>01:11:13.480 what happens if we give somebody 10  <br>01:11:16.880 times 20 times a 100 times more glp1  <br>01:11:19.199 than they naturally have what what's  <br>01:11:21.159 going to happen Let's test that so they  <br>01:11:23.400 did that and what happened was people's  <br>01:11:25.600 glucose levels started decreasing a lot  <br>01:11:27.800 because remember gp1 puts glucose away  <br>01:11:31.239 second impact people stopped  <br>01:11:35.360 eathing they were not hungry anymore  <br>01:11:38.159 they appetite Zapped

for better health.  <br>  <br>## IDEAS:  <br>- Glucose spikes can impact mental health, acne, and aging significantly.  <br>- Most fruits in supermarkets are not natural; they are bred for sweetness.  <br>- Eating sugar can lead to chronic fatigue and mitochondrial dysfunction.  <br>- Insulin resistance is linked to infertility and hormonal imbalances in women.  <br>- Vinegar can reduce glucose spikes by up to 30% when consumed before meals.  <br>- Savory breakfasts can prevent glucose spikes and maintain energy levels throughout the day.  <br>- Consuming whole fruits is better than juices for managing glucose levels.  <br>- Eating foods in a specific order can significantly lower glucose spikes.  <br>- Adding fiber-rich veggies to meals can slow glucose absorption.  <br>- Regular exercise after meals helps to lower glucose levels effectively.  <br>- Many people are unaware of how sugar impacts their health negatively.  <br>- Elevated glucose levels in midlife increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  <br>- Foods like honey and grapes can cause significant glucose spikes despite being perceived as healthy.  <br>- Continuous glucose monitors help individuals understand their dietary impacts on glucose levels.  <br>- Insulin is responsible for storing glucose in fat cells, leading to weight gain.  <br>- The relationship between glucose and mood affects daily productivity and overall happiness.  <br>- Many cultures traditionally start meals with vegetables to improve glucose management.  <br>- High glucose diets can lead to increased inflammation and health issues.  <br>- Glucose spikes can cause cravings, making it difficult to maintain a balanced diet.  <br>- Lack of sleep can worsen insulin resistance and glucose management.  <br>- Health education around glucose management can empower individuals to reclaim their health.  <br>  <br>## INSIGHTS:  <br>- Understanding glucose management can empower individuals to improve their overall health and well-being.  <br>- Dietary choices impact glucose levels, affecting physical health, mental clarity, and emotional balance.  <br>- Reducing sugar intake can lead to significant improvements in energy and mood stability.  <br>- A balanced diet incorporating proteins and healthy fats helps mitigate glucose spikes effectively.  <br>- People are often unaware of the hidden sugars in seemingly healthy foods like fruit smoothies.  <br>- Knowledge about glucose can transform health outcomes, especially for those with insulin resistance.  <br>- The importance of educating the public on glucose impacts spans beyond personal health to societal health.  <br>- Implementing small dietary hacks can lead to substantial health improvements over time.  <br>- Sustainable health practices require a combination of dietary management, exercise, and education.  <br>- The body’s response to sugar reveals deeper connections between diet, mood, and cognitive function.  <br>  <br>## QUOTES:  <br>- “80% of the population have glucose spikes every single day and that’s when problems start happening.”  <br>- “The beauty of the technology of a smart home is its scalability: you can start small.”  <br>- “Glucose spikes have a few different consequences; having a few spikes here and there is not a big deal.”  <br>- “There’s no such thing as good sugar; all sugar is the same.”  <br>- “Eating a meal in the right order reduces the glucose spike by up to 75%.”  <br>- “The more glucose spikes you have, the harder it will be for your body to manage your spikes.”  <br>- “Insulin is responsible for storing glucose in fat cells, leading to weight gain.”  <br>- “Fasting is a stressor on the body; it is a good stressor but still a stressor.”  <br>- “Savory breakfasts can prevent glucose spikes and maintain energy levels throughout the day.”  <br>- “The relationship between glucose and mood affects daily productivity and overall happiness.”  <br>- “The food landscape is toxic, and most of us just eat sugar and starches.”  <br>- “Vinegar contains acetic acid which interacts with your digestive enzymes and cuts the glucose spike.”  <br>- “The more insulin resistant you are, the more likely you are to be infertile.”  <br>- “Glucose spikes can cause cravings, making it difficult to maintain a balanced diet.”  <br>- “People often believe that if the sugar is coming from a fruit, it’s good sugar.”  <br>- “High glucose diets can lead to increased inflammation and health issues.”  <br>- “You can’t just give somebody a scientific paper; you have to explain it in a visual way.”  <br>- “Eating sugar can lead to chronic fatigue and mitochondrial dysfunction.”  <br>- “Continuous glucose monitors help individuals understand their dietary impacts on glucose levels.”  <br>- “Insulin resistance is linked to infertility and hormonal imbalances in women.”  <br>  <br>## HABITS:  <br>- Start each day with a savory breakfast to stabilize glucose levels.  <br>- Consume vinegar diluted in water before meals to reduce glucose spikes.  <br>- Incorporate fiber-rich vegetables at the beginning of meals to slow glucose absorption.  <br>- Engage in light physical activity after meals to help manage glucose levels.  <br>- Monitor glucose levels regularly using continuous glucose monitors for better health insights.  <br>- Avoid sugary snacks and replace them with healthy savory alternatives.  <br>- Prioritize sleep and manage stress to maintain healthy insulin levels.  <br>- Educate yourself on food choices and their impact on glucose levels.  <br>- Experiment with the order of food consumption to manage glucose spikes effectively.  <br>- Avoid fruit juices and opt for whole fruits to benefit from fiber content.  <br>  <br>## FACTS:  <br>- One billion people globally have either type two diabetes or pre-diabetes.  <br>- High glucose levels in midlife increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease significantly.  <br>- Continuous glucose monitors reveal how specific foods affect individual glucose responses.  <br>- 90% of participants in a study reported reduced cravings using glucose management hacks.  <br>- Insulin resistance affects hormonal balance and can lead to infertility in women.  <br>- Glucose spikes can cause fatigue and impact mental clarity throughout the day.  <br>- Savory meals are traditionally served in many cultures to promote better digestion.  <br>- Grapes, despite being a fruit, can lead to significant glucose spikes in the body.  <br>- The average person consumes a diet high in starches and sugars, impacting health negatively.  <br>- Eating starches and sugars alone leads to rapid glucose spikes and subsequent crashes.  <br>- The body’s glucose response can influence mood, energy levels, and overall productivity.  <br>- High insulin levels prevent the body from burning fat effectively.  <br>- Reducing sugar intake is linked to improved mental health and lower cravings.  <br>- Health education around glucose management can empower individuals to reclaim their health.  <br>- Fiber-rich foods help slow glucose absorption and promote better health outcomes.  <br>- The food landscape is increasingly filled with processed sugars and unhealthy options.  <br>- Eating a balanced diet with proteins, fats, and fiber is crucial for glucose management.  <br>  <br>## REFERENCES:  <br>- "The Glucose Goddess Method" by Jesse

what I know about this disorder what's causing**0:05**it and what we're not doing to prevent it or treated it it will be recognized as the greatest tragedy in the history**0:10**of medicine Thomas CA freed is a professor of biology genetics and biochemistry who has dedicated the past**0:16**30 years Gathering scientific evidence on what could be the true origin and prevention of cancer cancer is getting**0:22**worse and there's no major advance in reducing death rates and I can speak to the reasons for that all major cancer**0:29**research PL think cancer is a genetic disease you believe otherwise it's not whether you believe it's what the data**0:34**tell us and the evidence is massive to support that cancer is a metabolic disorder and the problem is we're doing**0:40**everything we possibly can in our lifestyle to induce it the scientific evidence is there like for example we**0:46**know that cancer was extremely rare in African tribes that were living according to the traditional ways but**0:52**when modern lifestyle entered into their societies cancer out of control we even did a study on THS we know that wolves**0:58**in the wild don't die from cancer but cancer is the number one killer of domestic dogs why it's because of our**1:05**lifestyle issues and a lot of us are doing things without the knowledge that it would put us at risk but with**1:10**metabolic therapy you can use it as both a prevention and a treatment and we're seeing more and more of terminal cancer**1:15**patients outliving their predictabilities because of this and let me tell you one thing and remember it if you do metabolic therapy you can**1:22**actually reduce risk for cancer you can take away the fear and when you say metabolic therapy tell me what those**1:27**things are number one before this episode starts I have a**1:32**small favor to ask from you two months ago 74% of people that watched this channel didn't subscribe we're now down**1:38**to 69% my goal is 50% so if you've ever**1:44**liked any of the videos we've posted if you like this channel can you do me a quick favor and hit the Subscribe button it helps this channel more than you know**1:50**and the bigger the channel gets as you've seen the bigger the guests get thank you and enjoy this**1:58**episode Professor C if someone walks up to you on the street and they're you know they know nothing  <br>**What Would Dr Seyfried Say He Does?2:03**about science and they know nothing about medicine Etc and they asked you what do you do and why do you do it how would you respond I'm a professor of**2:10**biology at Boston College so uh in that role I spent a lot of my time working**2:16**with undergraduates and graduate students in training them to be scientific literate in in various**2:23**aspects of biology the research program that we have at the University is also**2:29**Focus fed on understanding uh how to manage cancer better how it originates**2:35**and how to prevent it how much of a problem is cancer globally what are the  <br>**How Much Of A Problem Is Cancer Globally?2:40**sort of headline statistics on the macro view of cancer for someone that really doesn't know yeah well it's getting**2:46**worse uh I can't say there it's in the millions I I I know precisely what's**2:52**going on in this country because the American Cancer Society uh every year uh**2:57**distributes the data on on cancer um we have almost two million new cases**3:04**diagnosed per year in the United States and we have 1,700 people a day**3:10**dying from cancer in in the United States which comes to about 70 people**3:15**per hour in the United States now when I went to China I looked at some numbers**3:22**there and it was 8,000 people a day are dying from cancer obviously the population is so much**3:28**larger and uh I don't know what it is in the UK I mean we'd have to go to their cancer**3:34**Registries but but what we do know is that it's supposed to be a lot worse by**3:39**2050 than it is today so there seems to be no reduction in death suffering for**3:45**this disease and I I can speak to the the reasons for that but right now I**3:51**would say it's a global uh epidemic of cancer it's not it's not getting better it's getting worse more people are dying**3:57**from it there's no major advance in in reducing death rates so it's a great**4:03**tragedy so um and when we when we understand what's causing it and what**4:08**we're not doing to prevent it or treat it it'll it'll be recognized as the singular greatest tragedy in the history**4:14**of of medicine worldwide when it when when they come to know what I know about this disorder and then they realize what**4:21**we've been doing in in in in in a misdirected way it will be recognized as**4:26**the greatest tragedy in the history of medicine what Tye types of cancer are people dying from what is the most  <br>**What Types Of Cancer Are People Dying From?4:32**popular types of cancer for men and women well it's always been lung cancer pretty much for men and women uh lung**4:38**cancer has always been the number one but but we have pancreatic breast cancer colon cancer these are all on the rise**4:45**colon cancer is on the rise pancreatic cancer is on the rise in this country I I I I can't speak for other countries**4:52**they may dare very slightly due to diet lifestyle issues but lung cancer has always been recognized as as the number**5:00**one cancer how many people in the United States then based on the statistics would develop cancer well it seems to  <br>**How Many People Will Develop Cancer?5:07**increase every year so it's kind of a moving Target it doesn't seem to go down**5:13**you know what it is today I don't know but what I do know is the numbers of people that are dying each day because**5:19**the um American Cancer Society comes out with I think it's 612,000**5:25**people uh will die this year 2024 uh from cancer**5:30**in this year so divide it by 365 and it comes out to just about 1,700 people a**5:36**day divide that number by 24 and you get about 70 people an hour based on the**5:41**numbers provided to us from the American Cancer Society when they say we've made**5:47**major advances in man in cancer incidences right so in the 1990s they**5:53**instituted the uh anti-smoking campaigns all right so today if you read they say**5:59**we have reduced cancer deaths by 30 31 or 32% wow that sounds really impressive**6:06**so what they do is they take the number this is what the national the American Cancer Society has done and published in**6:12**their papers okay if we didn't stop smoking in the 90s and everybody**6:18**continued to smoke the trajectory would be very very high because we stopped**6:23**smoking or this it's we have 33% lower death than if we didn't stop smoking but**6:30**the trajectory is continuing to increase maybe not as steep as it would have been had we continued to smoke so it's it was**6:36**clearly a prevention it had nothing to do with a a treatment it had to do with prevention that was giving the the the**6:43**oh we've made major advances in in reducing cancer death rate yeah because people sto smoking for the mo for many**6:49**many people more people would have died had they not smoked so we have um people**6:55**that are not not real people we're just looking at what would have happened if if we didn't stop smoking what are the  <br>**Where Does Cancer Rank In The Probabilities Of Taking My Life?7:02**leading causes of death worldwide in terms of diseases is is I I hear that**7:07**heart disease is number one I think that's heart disease is number one uh cancer is number two okay and there are**7:15**many different types of cancer right there's hundreds of different forms of cancer if you look under the electron**7:21**microscope or a correction even a light micro this is how most cancers are diagnosed by by light**7:27**microscopy uh you look under the microscope and you see a bunch of cells that are dysmorphic in the way they look**7:33**and then they all have genetic defects and all this kind of stuff but they all have one thing in common they depend on**7:39**a on a fermentation energy without oxygen so all cancers are a singular type of disease it's just that they**7:46**happen in different tissues but when you look at the underlying problem they're all very very similar they can't live uh**7:51**without a fermentation which means energy without oxygen so that's the common pathophysiological problem in all**7:58**cancers whether it's a colon brain breast bladder skin uh lung we we've**8:04**looked at all these cancers and they're all they're all essentially using the same mechanism to to grow out of control**8:11**so what is that F fermentation you mentioned fermentation is energy without oxy what does that mean uh we breathe  <br>**What Is The Fermentation Process?8:17**air and we uh exhale CO2 and water vapor and those are the waste products of the food that we eat we break everything is**8:24**broken down and combusted in our mitochondria of the cell and the waste products are Co 2 and water Vapors those**8:31**are the waste products but if you and I were to stop breathing for any**8:36**particular time period uh uh our bodies would fill up with uh lactic acid and**8:42**succinic acid like if we were to have a heart attack or when somebody has a heart attack um they don't die instantly**8:49**uh if if they if they're there without for five or seven minutes without oxygen they they may die because the brain dies**8:55**but if you can get the heart to beat again and get oxygen back in the system you can come alive again but when we**9:01**have that massive Interruption of oxygen into our body um the cells fall back on**9:08**an ancient they up they immediately turn on these ancient Pathways to get energy**9:14**without oxygen for a short period of time and that's the sugar glucose which**9:19**is already in our bloodstream from the food we eat and the amino acid glutamine which is a high amino acid in our**9:26**bloodstreams highest level of amino acid is the glutamine these two fuels are now**9:32**burned for energy obtain energy without oxygen there's no there's a these**9:37**Pathways upregulate and you can get ATP which is energy to keep you alive for a short period of time but your**9:43**bloodstream is filling up with the waste products called lactic acid and succinic acid lactic acid is coming from glucose**9:51**to sugar and succinic acid is coming from the amino acid glutamine and they build up and that tells you you're**9:57**fermenting you're getting energy without oxygen because you're not breathing very simple you're not breathing but I'm Not**10:02**Dead Yet now of course if you don't get it for very long you die it's just that**10:07**now the other way you can stop uh oxygenation in our bodies quickly is**10:13**with the poison cyanide so if we God forbid we were to take cyanide we'd be**10:18**both dead within within a minute we just just because our bodies are completely shut down of energy from oxygen now**10:26**here's the cancer cell the cancer cell lives in in can live in in cyanide**10:32**cyanide does not kill a tumor okay War a warberg showed this a long time ago and we've also shown the same thing in our**10:39**lab others have shown this the interesting thing is when you look at cancer cells even in the presence of**10:44**oxygen even in oxygen they're throwing out lactic acid and succinic acid what**10:49**does that mean that means the en the organ organel inside the cell that**10:55**generates energy is not efficient it's inefficient and the cells are using**11:00**ancient fermentation and when I say ancient fermentation you have to realize the Earth is 4 and a half billion years**11:06**old um the organisms that existed on our planet uh two and a half billion years**11:12**ago were all fermenters there was no oxygen in the atmosphere till the photosynthetic bacteria started making**11:18**oxygen they were living cells they had no oxygen and they were growing like**11:23**crazy unregulated growth just unreg what's going on here and they would die**11:28**as soon as the mble fuels were dissipated as they gobbled up everything they would just die so they lived as**11:34**long as they could reproduce and have fermentation fuels the cancer cell in our body is doing nothing than falling**11:40**back on these ancient fermentation Pathways that become accelerated up regulated in the tumor cell because the**11:48**efficiency of the energy coming from the mitochondria is now uh depleted it's**11:53**defective in many different ways so this is very clear and this happens in lung cancer colon canc we've looked at all**12:00**the major Cancers and we found out these common defects are seen in all the cancers so they're all very similar in**12:06**their metabolism they're very different in what they look like under the microscope lung doesn't look like colon doesn't look like brain um they're very**12:13**different genetically they're all different from each other but they're all common in a in a dependency on this  <br>**How Have You Arrived At This Conclusion?12:19**ancient pathway of energy metabolism can you take me back you mentioned a guy called Walberg there yeah can you take**12:26**me back on the journey that the scientific community or at least you have been on to arrive at the conclusion**12:31**that the central sort of causal Factor at least an indication of a causal factor of cancer lies in this shift in**12:38**Energy Systems where did this understanding start in in research well it started with Oto warberg for sure uh**12:44**in the 1920s uh the other linkage before I tell you what OT warberg did because I**12:50**was like everybody else I thought cancer was a genetic disease and and I heard about warberg didn't really know what**12:56**what he was talking about or invested any time thinking about what he said but**13:01**Linda nebling was a PhD nursing student at Case Western Reserve University and**13:07**in Ohio and she took these two little hopeless kids brain cancer we call**13:12**hopeless cases when they have no um predictability of long-term survival and**13:18**she gave them a ketogenic diet to lower blood sugar and she was able to rescue**13:24**these kids one one one eventually died the other one was lost to followup and she said it her strategy was based on**13:30**what OT warberg had said about glucose and cancer so then I said warberg I said who the hell what let me go back and**13:37**check out who this guy was and what he did because I was seeing similar things in the in the mouse with that drug it**13:42**was lowering glucose and and we were sh shrinking these tumor cells and we published a paper uh the first one of**13:49**the first ever papers linking that how high your blood sugar is determines how fast your tumor will grow in the mice**13:55**and now how this been replicated in all human cancers the higher your blood sugar the faster the tumor grows the**14:01**lower the blood sugar the slower the tumor grows undeniable for all different human Mouse cancers wow so warberg had**14:09**said this a long time ago back in the 1920s he he was taking slices of all**14:14**kinds of human and rat mouse tumors and slicing them up and he noticed something really strange about these um cancers**14:22**they take in less oxygen compared to the normal tissue from which they came wow**14:27**so they're kind of like oxygen deprived and they were throwing out this lactic acid waste product that he was that he**14:33**was saying and they were taking in so much more glucose than the normal so the normal cells take in just a little bit**14:39**of glucose and they can make tremendous energy from a tiny amount this guy was taking in huge amounts of glucose but**14:45**not fully metabolizing it to CO2 and water but dumping it out as lactic acid**14:51**which is a a breakdown product of glucose that is not fully metabolized in the cell wow he said this is**14:58**unbelievable and then he did all kinds of tissue I looked at his data was unbelievable he was cutting humans mice**15:04**rats and seeing the same thing over and over again and uh he was saying the**15:09**origin of cancer has to do with something in the ability of the mitochondrian the organel to generate**15:16**efficient energy from oxygen so the sorry the mitochondria is the part of the cell that creates energy it's the**15:22**part of the cell that creates energy through oxidative phosphorilation which is burning energy using oxygen okay okay**15:30**so it's like an engine it's an engine a very highly efficient engine that this is an organel you have to realize we**15:37**have the cell yeah and we have a nucleus that every everybody knows about this nucleus and then we have all these**15:42**little organel in there we have lomes and we have the mitochondrian which is like a spaghetti Network inside the cell**15:50**they fuse it's actually a second living it's a second living organism inside our cells and to simplify what they do the**15:57**mitochondria they convert oxygen and glucose into energy yes and they combust**16:02**uh energy uh they they take the foods that we eat have carbon hydrogen bonds**16:07**okay and we break those down inside our mitochondria and we and we and we when we break those bonds down we create a a**16:14**hydrogen gradient and we dissipate that gradient through an impeller mechanism that generates energy like crazy it's**16:21**unbelievable very efficient highly efficient but the cancer cell has corruption in that system but it doesn't**16:27**happen overnight as warberg said if you break that system too acutely and too fast the cell will die it doesn't have**16:34**the so you have to have two things to get from oxidative phosphorilation to uh**16:40**energy with with with minimal oxygen fermentation sorry just to keep it simple from a normal cell to a cancer**16:46**cell from a normal cell to a cancer cell doesn't happen overnight okay it's a chronic damage to the ability of of that  <br>**Why Do Cancers Grow So Rapidly?16:53**organel inside the cell to generate efficient energy okay so all we have to**16:59**know with cancer is that they're how are they growing so rapidly why are they going out of control how come it's so**17:04**hard to kill them because as long as you have those fermentable fuels that drive**17:10**this ancient fermentation pathway um they will continue to grow they're very hard to kill and the fermenting fuels**17:17**are glucose and and glutamine glutamine yeah okay so here let's let me tell you**17:22**in a nut are are you ready brace yourself are you ready I'm ready are you braced are you braced sufficiently bra**17:28**sufficient he's sufficiently braced okay so uh a solution to the cancer problem**17:35**to manage cancer without toxicity is to simultaneously restrict the two fuels**17:42**that are needed to drive this disregulated growth while transitioning the whole body off to a fuel that the**17:49**tumor cells can't use which is fatty acids and Ketone bodies so when we take**17:55**the cancer patients or the mice we put them into a calorie restriction lowering**18:00**the blood sugar uh that I said is one half of the two fuels you can lower that down really really low and then we use**18:08**specific drugs to Target the glutamine and together we can selectively restrict**18:14**the two fuels while we transition the whole body over to to ketones we as a**18:20**species evolved to be in nutritional ketosis for the the majority of our existence as a as a species like one and**18:26**a half million years for for centuries and centuries thousands and thousands of years our species you and me our**18:34**ancestors were always in a state of nutritional ketosis because there was very few carbohydrates in the**18:40**environment for them to be consuming right so the cancer cell the body you and I could if we stopped eating and we**18:46**took a low carbohydrate diet and just did water only fasting we would get into nutritional ketosis where the normal**18:53**cells our brain our kidneys our heart can be burning these Ketone bodies**18:58**because they have a good mitochondria and they can burn these fuels effectively the tumor cells have a bad mitochondria they can't burn those fuels**19:05**they're dependent on glucose and glutamine we can replace glucose and glutamine with Ketone bodies in the normal cells of our so we selectively**19:12**marginalize these tumor cells slowly over time uh we they slowly start to Die  <br>**What Are Ketones?19:18**the blood vessels disappear and the body comes in and dissolves them so for someone that has never heard the term**19:24**keto before ketosis or ketones in a simple way what are KET ketones ketones**19:31**are water soluble breakdown products of fatty acids okay they're beta hydroxy beate acetoacetate these are small**19:38**molecules that are water soluble the liver throws them out like crazy kidney a little bit but mostly liver so as I**19:45**told you earlier when we don't eat um you you get anxious mainly because**19:52**our brains are addicted to glucose it's like cocaine and nicotine and whatever**19:57**you start getting all antsy haven't eaten anything you know uh what's going on um so you then once the body realizes**20:04**you ain't going to eat anything we have to start mobilizing out of our fat resources and the fats uh go into the**20:10**bloodstream as triglycerides which are three fatty acids attached to a glycerol**20:16**backbone they go to the liver the liver chops them up and puts out these little water soluble Ketone bodies that the**20:24**name Ketone body is kind of a weird thing from biochemistry but but they're called Ketone bodies um and they can**20:31**supply the brain with energy the heart with energy and not only that they're a super fuel it's unbelievable that**20:38**mitochondria Burns these ketones okay but they ener remember I was talking about how energy efficient the**20:43**mitochondria become when they burn ketones they become even more energy efficient it's unbelievable how you you**20:49**they don't need as much oxygen to generate more en that's why they my colleagues called and some of the greats**20:56**in the bio in the biochemistry field called them super super fuel because you**21:01**can get more energy bang for buck burning a ketone body than you can burning a pyruvate coming from glucose**21:07**or even a fatty acid uh and the biochemistry for that is is interesting**21:12**but but the bottom line is when you transition away from these fuels to ke we don't forget we evolved our our**21:19**ancestors were always in a state of ketosis you get into that state by consuming very few carbohydrates and  <br>**What Can We Learn About Cancer From Our Ancestors?21:25**having a lot of energy and this is the way our ancestors were so what can we learn from our ancestors about cancer**21:31**how prevalent was cancer um when we look back at our ancestors if they were often in a state of ketosis yeah well um it's**21:39**hard to determine uh from skeletal records uh but I think we can look at U**21:45**um modern pop modern man who live according to their traditional ways um**21:52**you know uh Albert schwitzer the Great humanitarian physician went to Africa and looked at Africans that were living**21:58**according to the traditional ways and he said one of the weirdest things they don't have cancer it was like what what**22:04**uh cancer was extremely rare in Africans in ints living in in the in the areas**22:12**British when they came you know in in in looking at the health conditions of folks that lived in the Arctic Circle**22:18**cancer was not there they had other things but they didn't have cancer um Aboriginal folks so it seems as though**22:25**uh our living we we can't go back 50,000 years ago because we don't have people**22:30**to examine but we have people to examine today and that was one of the things schwitzer and several other Physicians**22:36**from Europe would go to Africa and they would look at these some of these tribes that were traditional and they would say**22:42**whoa what's going on with these Africans how come they don't have but when modern diet lifestyle entered into their**22:48**societies cancer out of control what about what about our the primate cousins**22:54**yeah um there's never been a documented uh case a breast cancer in a female**23:00**chimpanzee uh and they're 98% similar to us in Gene and protein sequence uh you**23:05**know what's going on with that um monkeys uh they don't generally form cancer they're eating they're not eating**23:12**what we eat okay don't forget we did not evolve to eat pork pies and Dunkin**23:19**Donuts jelly fil donnuts and pizzas we did not our ancestors did not eat this right we were killing and eating Animals**23:26**As I said we ate everything that walked crawled flew or swam on this planet became part of our diet um we did not**23:33**have Donuts on every corner delicate essin on every corner our we evolved over this period of time just like our**23:40**primate ancestors uh the animals chimps and gorillas and things that you see in**23:46**the zoos are fed their natural diets as if they were living in in their habitat**23:51**their natural habitat whether it was in South America Africa or wherever it was were're not throwing in jelly donuts**23:57**every day and pizza pie into the chimpanzee pen and as a matter of fact I even went to the zoo down down here in**24:04**in Boston Franklin Park Zoo and also at the San Diego Zoo I said how come how**24:10**come you guys don't give these guys run down and get a big pizza for these for these animals oh no it' be animal**24:16**cruelty their systems aren't Geared for this well neither are**24:22**we we have an obesity epidemic we have all these different chronic diseases why**24:27**we didn't have to eat all this crap that we're eating today so what I've told many people in these podcasts is that**24:33**our food science and technology and our society's technology has evolved so much  <br>**What Role Does Exercise Play In Fighting These Diseases?24:39**faster than our biology can you explain to me in simple terms the role the exercises playing in staving of cancer**24:46**well exercise lowers blood sugar you know you and and also lowers glutamine so uh the two fuels that are driving uh**24:53**now we can't completely remove glutamine by exercise that's for sure um but we my**24:58**my late good friend George kahill published some papers on showing how exercise could actually lower uh**25:04**glutamine availability so it's a it's a little bit of a push but you're also when you exercise you're burning and**25:10**you're not eating a lot of carbs your mitochondria burning ketones and the oxygenation from all the exercise is**25:16**keeping those mitochondria super healthy at their highest level of Energy Efficiency so exercise you're building**25:23**muscle as well aren't you yeah you're building well you can build muscle but you're certainly getting aerobic exercise to oxygen is coming in and**25:30**you're burning ketones which I already told you is a super fuel so your body is super healthy uh these bodies from the**25:37**Paleolithic period these men were jacked there was no obesity in these people they had tremendous energy they're**25:43**they're not dying from uh the things that are killing us they're dying from injuries and infections when you  <br>**What Lifestyle Choices Are Causing The Cancer To Develop?25:49**described this slow and gradual shift in the cell as it moves to this sort of**25:55**ancient system it sounded very gradual so in my I thought okay so does that mean that the cancer is a gradual**26:03**process that is kind of building up in me or isn't building up in Me based on the lifestyle decisions I'm making and**26:09**my environmental factors right now like I'm trying to say does is does**26:15**cancer start slowly years before you you you know you find it is a gradual process but it can**26:22**be impacted by several provocative Agents from the from the micro environment um lack of exercise okay so**26:30**we're not exercising nearly as much as our Paleolithic ancestors Bar None right**26:35**we have massive amounts of processed carbs in our diets we have a lot of emotional stress uh um mental emotional**26:44**stress that's impacting negatively on on our biology um we we have lack of sleep**26:52**sleep uh a lot of us because we we have stresses you you have to have when you put all of these impact act ful things**26:58**together in one person you can put yourself at risk for Cancer all of which**27:04**will damage and reduce the efficiency of mitochondria and also the joy of living**27:11**uh having friends and friendships and and this kind of thing reduces stress in a lot of different ways makes people**27:17**enjoy getting up and and having a a nice day rather than being depressed or or these kinds of things um you put all all**27:24**this together and you put yourself in a a diet and lifestyle that puts you at risk for damage to oxidative**27:31**phosphorilation and the transition from one form of energy to a fermentation energy and what I'm trying to understand**27:36**is that a it's a grad a gradual transition you have to be able to do that and how long does it take for a**27:43**colon a group of cells in a in a in a crypt of your colon to transition from**27:48**one stage to another you have to be constantly under stress those cells and that organ now why somebody gets colon**27:55**cancer another person gets breast cancer another person gets black cancer and some person gets a brain cancer and all these different kinds of cancers what**28:01**whatever happened the process was dis was causing a gradual disruption of**28:07**oxidative phosphorilation oxidative respiration and a and a gradual transition to a fermentation like in the**28:14**brain the neurons rarely if ever get cancer but the gal cells that support neurons they are usually the source of**28:21**the origin of cancer in the brain for those kinds of cells and you can look at different cells and some are more or**28:27**less prone and why this guy got lung cancer from from smoking cigarettes this guy got bladder cancer from smoking**28:33**cigarettes how did it all start it all started from a population of cells in one of those organs having an a chronic**28:41**not instant a chronic Interruption of oxidative energy followed by an upregulation of this fermentation energy**28:48**so really we need to be thinking about all the things that have caused dysfunction in the mitochondria absolutely I want to get a list of the**28:54**key things that are associated with causing this dysfunction okay carcinogens okay so carcinogens and you**29:00**know there's many asbesto there's all kinds of chemicals in the environment you hear about this oh there's a whole**29:05**list of carcinogens we and they put them on the on the labels on different chemicals they say carcinogenic  <br>**Is Cancer Genetic?29:11**potential and whatever you have what are the types of things that are C cogenic that most people don't realize oh well**29:17**now we're talking about microplastics we're talking about um is that in part what causes breast cancer cuz I always**29:25**think about dooen with breast cancer and and the stuff that we're kind of lathering onto our arm yeah well the the**29:30**one that was was most interesting was the talcum powder one how does talcum powder would cause ovarian cancer okay**29:37**it's taken up into the urogenital tract and it forms a fosi in in a part of the**29:42**ovarian tissue what's a fosi a Locus like a collection of material a fosi is**29:49**a an area where say talum materials would be accumulating and that leads to a**29:56**inflammatory um area of the body and our immune**30:01**system comes in to see what's going on our immune system is a healing machine and they see something that's not not**30:08**normal normally they would clean it up but they throw grow cyto kindes and growth factors on there leading to**30:14**disregulated damage to mitochondria and disregulated it and then you get this tumor that starts so if I get a talcum**30:21**powed uh granule or whatever and it goes into my body my body then tries to**30:26**attack it to sort of out and in doing so it creates inflammation which leads to damage to mitochondria in a particular**30:32**group of cells near that fosi okay and this this is applicable to I guess a lot of different Nano particles and yeah and**30:39**microplastics are this now they're looking at this but then we have chemical carcinogens tetrahydrochloride there's all kinds of other things that**30:45**can actually damage arsenics and and these kinds of chemicals um urethane uh**30:52**anything that could chronically damage uh a mitochondrian forcing over time for**30:58**ing it to upregulate the fermentation energy without oxygen isn't this most things I'm trying to figure out what I**31:04**how to live my life yeah well that's what that that's why it was called the oncogenic Paradox but but you can you  <br>**How Do We Keep Our Mitochondria Healthy?31:09**can avoid that that's why I'm saying if you can keep your mitochondria healthy how exercise and reduce uh consumption**31:17**of Highly processed carbohydrates do I need to be avoiding these microplastics as well you you know the problem with**31:23**microplastics they're very ubiquitous we're not really sure uh we just now becoming aware of it nobody really knew**31:29**that before um look it up it's but it could it could cause U small fosi in**31:35**different populations of cells but you know it's very hard to really chronically damage mitochondria**31:41**mitochondria a tough organel the problem is we are chronically abuse it without realizing what we need to do to keep it**31:47**healthy so even if you are exposed to chemical carcinogens even if you are exposed to all these things but you're**31:53**keeping your body as healthy as you possibly can you could possibly delay or**31:58**even prevent the damage to the mitochondria even though you have the even though you are being exposed to**32:04**this so it's a it's actually in your hands um you can actually reduce**32:10**risk for cancer by knowing what keeps your mitochondria healthy vigorous**32:15**exercise uh fasting water only fasting um you know it's very hard some but**32:21**sometimes we when we were putting mice on calorie restriction it was hard to get them to get tumors their body was so**32:26**healthy this was shown Years Ago by by a couple of scientists in mice using mice**32:32**with that developed a lot of breast cancer if you put them on a calorie restricted diet the incidence was way**32:37**way down so cancer is very preventable it's a very preventable uh disorder it's  <br>**Is Cancer Genetic?32:42**just that we're doing everything we possibly can induce it in our diet lifestyle a lot of big institutions**32:49**believe that cancer is a genetic problem**32:54**um you believe otherwise the evidence is striking I mean to believe it's not**33:00**whether you believe it's what the data tell us okay so according to the somatic mutation theory of cancers mutations in**33:07**the nucleus lead to disregulated cell growth that's the sematic mutation theory in the mitochondrial metabolic**33:13**Theory it's a transition from oxidative phosphorilation to to a fermentation metabolism inside inside the cell um the**33:22**mutations are largely irrelevant what do you mean by that when the mitochondria become defective they throw out**33:29**Ros reactive oxygen species that are carcinogenic and mutogenic W what does**33:36**that mean causing mutations so a lot of the mutations that we see in the nucleus of the tumor cell that is the subject of**33:42**the sematic mutation Theory are Downstream effects of the dysfunction of the mitochondria so the mitochondria is**33:49**causing a downstream effect which are mutations which according to the sematic mutation Theory are the cause of the**33:54**disregulated cell growth let me tell you why that's absolutely untrue there's some cancer cells growing**34:00**out of control have no mutations and normally not discuss how can that be that's a a challenge to the theory if**34:07**the theory says that all cancers have mutations and you have some cancers that have no mutations and they're growing out of control that should say who bell**34:14**ring one uh then they the the sematic mutation uh people people who think this**34:20**said oh okay we have we have a problem here not all mutations are the ones that cause the disregulated only some and we**34:27**have a name for those some that's called driver mut okay now it's a nice term because some of those mutations are**34:32**called passengers they don't really do anything but the drivers are the ones that lead to the disregulated cell**34:37**growth so we should be focusing our attention on these driver mutations new evidence from the recent scientific**34:43**literature can you believe this they're taking tissue normal tissues from patients different organs and things**34:49**like this from not patients from normal people no cancer perfectly like yourself here we would take tissue from you and**34:55**say oh my Christ look at the you got driver mutation in your esophagus and your different parts of your body you**35:00**got driver but you don't have a tumor what's going on with that how you explain that these driver mutations are**35:05**causing disregulated cell growth when we have thousands of driver mutations that are there that are not causing**35:11**disregulated cell growth oh okay that's a another problem the biggest devastating information against the**35:18**somatic mutation theory is if you take the nucleus from a tumor cell cleanly take it out of the tumor cell and you**35:24**have another normal cell here you take the nor the nucleus out of the normal cell and you put the tumor cell into**35:30**that cytoplasm you get regulated growth no disregulated growth but if I have the normal cell and have a tumor cell take**35:37**the tumor nucleus out of there and take the normal nucleus and put it into the tumor cytoplasm which contains**35:43**mitochondri defective mitoch disregulated cell Dr this has been seen over and over and over again so just to**35:48**summarize that so if you take the tumor nucleus side of the cell and put it into a a normal healthy cell yes um**35:55**everything's fine everything is fine but if you take take healthy cell nucleus and put it into a tumor cell you still**36:00**have the same dis regulated cell growth tumor growth so which means that it's not the nucleus absolutely it's**36:06**something else it's something else and that's the mitochondria and I told you then you have cancer cells with no mutations and then you have driver**36:12**mutations and normal cells that never become cancer you put all those things together and you have to be uh a**36:19**hopeless ideologue to think that cancer is a genetic disease um it's a silent**36:26**assumption in the field that cancer is a genetic every textbook of biology cell biology and bio cancer is a genetic  <br>**Why Haven't Opinions Changed Based On Dr Seyfried's Evidence?36:31**disease why hasn't people's opinions changed despite the evidence that you**36:37**present it's a very difficult thing it goes back to um when you have one Theory**36:44**replacing another theory it's called Paradigm Paradigm shifts and in all in**36:49**history of science Paradigm shifts have been met with great great resistance uh the clear the clearest one was the**36:56**Kernan Revolution when uh for eight 1,800 years astronomers in**37:04**our early Astron astronomers thought the Earth was immovable in the center of the solar system for 1,000 this was Claudius**37:12**TMI Aristotle and the Bible and all these Earth is immovable and the Sun and**37:18**the Moon and the planets all revolve around the earth 1,800 years even**37:24**Cernic's uh was working with these mathematical formulations this kep was being constantly confused until he said**37:31**what happens if we put the sun in the center of the solar system and consider the Earth as simply another planet that**37:37**would revolve oh all of a sudden things started to make sense and gardano Bruno**37:44**uh a theologian was put to death for suggesting that cernus was right um**37:50**there was a tremendous resistance on the part of the Roman Catholic Church at that time and this is the same thing**37:56**that happened when when and um Lewis Pastor said the germs the germs rather than bad air are the cause of disease so**38:04**uh and when Darwin Wallace theory of evolution came it's not special creation it's it's natural selection that that**38:10**can explain this these were massive Paradigm changes in the history of Science and what we're seeing today is**38:17**the same thing the mitochondria is the center of the problem with cancer not the nucleus the mitochondria it's a**38:23**mitochondrial metabolic disease and once you realize that we're going to drop these death rates massively in a very a  <br>**If We Adopt This Mindset, What Will Happen To Cancer Statistics?38:31**number of years for sure so if we take two paths then if we realize that that the mitochondria is the center of the**38:37**dysfunction and ultimately disease in the cell yes if we go that down that path what impact do you think that will**38:43**have on the canc cancer statistics over the coming years it'll drop it massively**38:48**okay I'm not going to say we'll get rid of cancer completely uh but here's the thing we may never get rid of it but we**38:54**can learn to live with it and keep it at Bay if if we know how to if we know that it can't survive without these two fuels**39:00**and you can do a diet and lifestyle that can restrict the availability of those two fuels and keep your mitochondria as**39:06**healthy as you possibly can what if we don't go down that path what you think then you're going to be right one out of two people are going to be having cancer**39:13**that your statistics are going to be U AB absolutely correct is there anybody that you believe because you know when  <br>**Are The Current Cures Working?39:19**we talk about these subjects often we think of like big Farmer and the incentives and money and follow the money and you'll figure out why people**39:25**don't want change are is any of that sort of conspiratorial thinking correct in your view are they I**39:31**don't know if that's conspiracy I don't like conspiracy terms that's absurds I like what are the facts of what we're**39:38**looking at but do you see a resistance from Big farmer to entertain this point of view um what do you think what do you**39:45**think I mean do you think this is I mean you're making a lot of not you but but people in these in that those Industries**39:51**the hospital industry is making enormous amounts of money they're rewarding we get uh7 billion a year for cancer**39:58**research in the in the in in the National Cancer Institute awarding gr many many not all many grants to look at**40:05**for gene mutations and all this kind of stuff um and we have drugs that are extremely expensive based on a sematic**40:11**mutation theory of cancer that are basically not dropping the death rate as I said we got while we're talking here**40:17**we're g to have 140 people dead uh from cancer uh 1,700 people years getting**40:22**worse and worse um with as you said we're always running for raising money for cancer research uh where's all that**40:29**money going what are you doing with all that money no accountability and then when you look at the scientific advisory committee of all these societies that**40:36**you're running for they all think published papers on cancer as a genetic disease it's too hard for the field to**40:43**accept at this point um it's it's too traumatic at what I'm saying it's too**40:50**disruptive to a a massive industry uh at this time they will come to gradually**40:56**adjust to what I'm saying it's just a matter of time because we cannot continue this trajectory it's immoral**41:02**what we're doing to some of these people I read a St that said the global incidence of early onset cancer**41:07**increased by roughly 80% between 1990 yeah and 2019 that's in the bmj oncology**41:16**um early onset of cancer is basically patients under the age of 50 and and when I think about this you know growing up in the UK whenever there's a a fun**41:23**run a charity race a marathon whatever it might be cancer research get the money yeah and to hear that you know**41:29**there's been so much money invested in cancer research over the last couple of decades but there's been an increase of**41:34**80% in early onset cancer in the same period for me I'm like this research doesn't appear to be**41:41**do being very effective well as I said you got to find what people don't do is they never ask where's the research go**41:48**what kind of research what what are you doing what is the research it's the theory that drives the the impetus to do  <br>**The Current Technologies Used To Prevent Cancer41:54**research now a lot of great stuff has been done on you know keeping people alive that**41:59**suffer from cancers right because if you think about the probability of dying from a cancer I'm I'm assuming that has gone**42:06**down yeah uh to some extent it has you know we call there's two ways of looking it's called Uh progression free survival**42:12**and overall survival uh these are the terminologies that are used in the clinical world of cancer uh uh and they**42:19**represent the approval of drugs through the Food and Drug Administration if you have a drug that**42:25**improves a progression free survival uh progression free means it looks like**42:30**the drug is working on the tumor um because you know the tumor you can see it it gets bigger and bigger and more**42:36**lethal and more lethal and and if I see it not growing nearly as much uh I say**42:41**wow look at the it's it's slowing the what we call traditional progression okay it's called progression free**42:47**survival and then you have overall survival so you have two ways to approve**42:53**drugs mostly for cancer right how does it work on aggression free survival and**42:58**how does it work on overall survival well they stop looking at overall survival now somebody's going to bark**43:04**and say well you know bottom line is mostly progression free which means that the patients it looks like the tumor is**43:09**being effectively managed but they live only a couple of months longer than they would have if they didn't use this drug**43:16**so therefore it's approved and and and um that as opposed to overall survival**43:22**you know you're only living a two okay You' lived two and a half extra months the tumor looked like it was manage**43:27**pretty well but your overall survival is is this much but you you didn't see the tumor growing uh we're going to improve**43:34**that drug so a lot of the new drugs that we're giving do a really good job at progression free survival but they do a**43:40**horrible job in keeping people alive much longer which ultimately is what you want to do you want overall survival let**43:46**me give you an example avastin uh bismid this this is an immoral drug that should never be used on people it was blocked**43:53**because it caused colon perforations in women with breast cancer they still use it on brain cancer and when you so the**44:00**in the tumor you got a A tumor you can see it with PET Imaging and you can not so much pet MRI and Cat Scan you can see**44:06**it there and it's looking there okay uh you can see it now you give the patient a vaston and uh which is this um**44:15**anti-angiogenic drug it's supposed to stop the abnormal blood vessels right they think that the angiogenesis blood**44:22**vessels is is driving the disregulated growth it's the fermentation that's driving the just regulated growth by the**44:28**way so all of a sudden you give the the tumor kind of disappears it doesn't look like it whoa patient gets all excited**44:35**The Physician looks and says look at that look at the looks like you're doing well what it does the EV what the drug**44:41**does is it causes the tumors permeate your enti your entire brain just like spreading it through**44:48**your whole brain you don't live any longer uh but you had this progression free look at the tumor so the patient**44:54**gets excited because it looks like the tumor's disa appearing with this very expensive drug but what it does is it**45:00**almost guarantees that that patient will not survive because you spread the tumor cells through the whole brain so um this**45:07**is why I call it an immoral kind of a thing but chemotherapy and sort of these radiation therapies they have proven to**45:13**keep people alive who otherwise would have died in some cases they it can and**45:19**and that's another thing we have to look at we have and I I work heavily in brain tumors and G blastomas and things like**45:24**that when you irradiate somebody's brain uh who has one of these tumors you free up massive amounts of glucose and**45:30**glutamine in the micro environment and if you look at the survival when we did survival looked at survival curves for**45:35**gleo blast throughout the world oh it's un you can't even design experiments so consistent how fast people will die it's**45:42**like all the different hospitals have the same survival same survival what are you doing well we do chemo we do**45:48**surgical debulking uh T olomide and we give steroids which raise blood sugar and we irradiate we irradiate we**45:54**irradiate everybody's dead so um not everybody but you know fiveyear survival**46:00**is is very very low 10e survival is almost zero um but if you go if you got**46:05**a breast cancer or if you got this is brain cancer I'm talking about this is freeing up now yes if you have a**46:11**circumscribed tumor and it's not anywhere else you can come in with a radiation or surgical procedure and cure**46:18**essentially cure that patient but if you have any level of spread or anything like this um that that person now and**46:26**also if you're taking a toxic poison into your body like Red Devil docar rubison they call it Red Devil your P**46:32**turns red everything turns red what is that is that chemotherapy yes is a chemotherapy to kill a small group of cells um or maybe a little bit of a**46:40**spread but your your hair falls out your body gets brutalized uh by this and then**46:46**if you survive the cancer and many people do we have millions and millions of cancer survivers on this planet but**46:52**many many folks in that group suffer from the adverse effects of being p poisoned or irradiated or surgically**46:58**mutilated I mean they have to change their whole and often times the cancer comes back or they die from**47:04**cardiovascular disease or they die from secondary adverse effects of being brutalized uh with medieval I call it**47:11**medieval approaches to this are you kidding me what they're doing to cancer patients so when we do metabolic therapy**47:19**we we shrink the tumor down for sure then the surgeon can come in and he sees**47:24**it smaller fewer blood vessels because of the metab therapy and we can take out a greater amount uh of of this and then**47:30**we transition back to prevent this tumor from recurring metabolic therapy can be**47:35**used to not only prevent the cancer but can also be used to treat the cancer now let me tell you go most hospitals**47:42**suppose people say well you know I really want to do things to prevent cancer can I do standard of care before I have a tumor what do you mean you want**47:50**to go into a uh major Cancer Clinic and have toxic doxorubicin and radiation to**47:55**your body just in the event that you might get a cancer this is absurd but yet when you have cancer that's what they do to you right but with metabolic**48:03**therapy you can use it as both a prevention and a treatment it's just that with a treatment we bring in some more drugs to Target the glutamine we**48:09**don't do that on the prevention side on the I was just looking at some stats as you were speaking around the fiveyear**48:14**survival rates of a variety of different cancers um over time and it does appear**48:20**that survival rates of these cancers from breast cancer to prostate cancer to lung cancer to leukemias um and various**48:26**melanomas has improved since the 1970s so the 1970s to the 1990s to the**48:33**2010s there's been an improvement in the survival rate um which I guess is a credit to the research that's been done**48:40**um what you're saying is that this the treatments we have still today are horrific yeah and the and the survivals**48:46**are not that much greater it's not like you're getting massively longer survivals yeah I mean and I have to I I**48:52**have to preface that these stats might not be right because this is AI we're dealing with here but the there's a 5%**48:57**for example with breast cancer between the 1990s and 2010 there's just a 5% difference in overall survival in**49:04**overall survival okay so your survival your overall survival is two and a half to three months greater I I don't  <br>**How Do We Prevent Cancer?49:10**actually have those stats in no but that's that's that's the the evidence the papers that we're looking at so so**49:15**how do we prevent prevent this then I'm 32 years old now so I want to make sure that I**49:23**live my life in such a way that I limit my chance of cancer one of the things I always reflect on is the fact that many**49:28**of the people that I know that have got cancer breast cancer or other forms of cancer appear to be remarkably healthy**49:33**yeah always at the beginning there there not always but many times the person comes in gee I**49:39**just was diagnosed with cancer I didn't know I had it I didn't feel bad I didn't and then all of a sudden you get treated and they look like death warmed over but**49:45**I'm saying like how can how can healthy people be getting cancer if there's this sort of central well because you I as I**49:50**said are the the the the and we're seeing this I'm seeing it in my own I'm getting more and more emails from young**49:57**people in their 30s uh late 20s 30s early 40s like with colon cancer breast cancer and all these kinds of things but**50:04**look at our diet and lifestyle situation today those those things that I'm talking about lack of exercise a lot of**50:10**stress poor sleep bad food all of this kind of stuff impacting parts of our**50:15**bodies so what do we do about it though know about it and then and then what do we do so I know that's personal choice**50:21**I'm not here to take pieces and and jelly donuts off the market for sure or breakfast here I love that stuff too but**50:27**the qu the question is I don't eat it every day and I know if I do it'll kill**50:34**me so so yeah skipping meals water only fat occasionally there's a lot of things**50:41**you can do to keep your mitochondria healthy okay so tell me what those things are I just exercise you look like**50:46**you're a pretty healthy guy yeah I go to I go to the gym you don't look morbidly obese to me not not yet not yet well**50:51**that's important because you don't ever want it yet we would't be in America too long so my chan well and listen it's not**50:56**just the United States we were kind of like the first ones to plow that field but it's starting to spread everywhere I think in China they have the most 200**51:03**million obese people in China now so should I be on a keto diet then here's what we did okay uh we developed the  <br>**Should I Be On A Keto Diet?51:10**glucose Ketone index calculator at Boston College all right my students and I because we were trying to uh work with**51:17**cancer patients blood sugar and ketones um independently of each other we had a**51:23**ketone meter and we had a blood glucose meter so we were monitoring ketones by itself and glucose by itself and we**51:30**worked with a very nice woman U from American who lived in East France who since passed away from a brain stem**51:37**tumor was very very difficult we kept her alive very long but eventually we didn't know what we need what we know**51:42**now but she got into an argument for a handicapped parking spot with her neighbor upstairs and her blood sug and**51:50**blood sugar went through the roof she ran upstairs and she took her blood blood sugar and she says oh my God the tumor is going to grow I said what's**51:55**your ketones and she says oh it's still 2 and a half Miller well that's still pretty high usually it's very very low**52:01**it's very high so my students and I we said you know this is too traumatic to try to measure these two independently**52:08**why don't we make a singular number divide the glucose in molar in the blood by the Ketone and Molar in the blood now**52:15**you get this number that's much more stable and it allows the cancer patient to know that if I keep this Zone in 2.0**52:22**and below my tumor cells aren't going to be able to grow very fast I did this for the brain cancer right now it's being**52:28**used for all Cancers and now it's being used for guys like yourself who just want to stay healthy and because what it**52:35**is essentially is a quantitative determination if you're in the Paleolithic zone or not oh so if I'm at**52:40**2.0 like my friend Dominic the austino he's always down in these zones he's living the P he's a Paleolithic man**52:47**living in modern society what's a Paleolithic man that's how our ancestors were during the Paleolithic period okay**52:53**so he's got the right balance of glucose and ketones in his blood like we did when we were hunting mammoths and and**52:58**Buffalos and these kinds of things when we were hunter gatherers in the thousands of years of our existence as a**53:05**species tens of thousands of years he is in that zone is he in keto yeah well**53:10**that's that's what the low gki is that means you're at a level of Keto now yes**53:15**he doesn't eat a lot of carbohydrates in his diets eats leafy vegetables and a lot of meat and and this kind of thing**53:21**sparingly on fruits uh like grapefruits we learned from the epilepsy field great fruits provide a tremendous amount of**53:28**vitamin C with don't and do not Spike glucose that's that's very interesting so you can have uh certain fruits that**53:34**can keep you in this metabolic zone of P I call it the Paleolithic Zone which is the way we evolve with there was no**53:40**cancer in our in our existence when people hear that they might start jumping on the paleo diet I don't even know what the not a paleo diet it's it's**53:47**diets that are low in carbohydrates okay okay um Mediterranean diets like people**53:52**say to me at told God what should I eat should I eat this and that normally you would eat foods that have very low low**53:57**glycemic index which means the speed with which glucose is released like a banana very high in glycemic index you**54:04**eat a banana your blood sugar immediately spikes many fruits are like that um but you want you want foods that**54:11**keep a low steady uh uh gki now I built that uh calculator for brain cancer**54:19**patients initially then we realize it's powerful for all cancers uh we put the cancer patient in the low glucose Ketone**54:25**index we get them down in there then we come in with the glutamine targeting drugs to to kind of polish off these**54:31**tumors or put them in even a more dormant state but now we finding all these young kid like yourself all these**54:36**30 20 year olds what's your gki I mean they're out to weightlifting and they're looking at their G they don't have**54:42**cancer they're just excited to see they they can get into this Paleolithic Zone by themselves and that yes that will**54:48**prevent cancer because you can't get cancer if your mitochondria healthy if if you're in a Paleolithic Zone where our ancestors rarely have ever got**54:54**cancer then you're you're back in this oh you me to tell me I can't eat this and I can't eat that what does it do to  <br>**Dr Seyfried's Dog Study54:59**your gki oh Mak it go up well don't eat that so you did a study on dogs a dog**55:05**with a tumor yes can you tell me about that study it was a woman came to me and this is what I say does you don't have**55:12**to have a a PhD in Biochemistry to understand what some of the things this**55:18**woman had no degree whatsoever she just heard the uh about what we did to these mice and she did the same thing to her**55:25**dog um it was a pitbull and at aged seven years old it had big mast cell**55:30**tumor on its lip so she listened to my YouTube video over and over she said to me I just kept listening then he says I**55:37**I got I I I I got some raw chicken she says dogs wolves evolved to eat chickens**55:43**so she got some uh chicken Cho chopped up the chicken she cut the calories of she found some dog food calculator to**55:50**how much calories the dog was getting she cut the calories the dog look lost only 5% of its body weight**55:56**she got uh pollic fish oil raw eggs and cut all the calories everything was all**56:03**natural for this dog um and all of a sudden we have the pictures you can see them in the P if you saw the picture big**56:09**big tumor on its lip that the the veterinarians said this dog is gonna to survive you have to give him chemo and**56:15**radiation and surgery and all this kind of stuff and it's going to cost a lot of money the dog's gonna have diarrhea it's going to be you know she didn't want any**56:21**part of that so she said well let's just try this metabolic thing and and she**56:27**kept all the records and the pictures and what she did and how much she gave the dog and all this so I was able to get all that information from her um put**56:35**my friend Lauren Lauren Nations who was a veterinarian uh on the paper because I said what biology guy at Boston College**56:42**is telling you how to manage cancer in a dog we got to have some veterinarian on here to validate to make sure he's there**56:47**and he looked at the pictures and we looked at all the thing and disappeared so what happened was the dog eventually**56:53**died of heart disease at 15 and a 12 years years of age so essentially that's the only when people say well metabolic**57:01**therapy cure cancer I I say metabolic therapy is never considered a cure for**57:06**cancer it's an effective non-toxic management for cancer but in the case of that dog it appeared to work to cure the**57:12**dog but that's the only one I'll say oh he's gonna say cure cannot that dog happened to get he died from old age  <br>**Human Cases Of People That Have Followed Your Research57:17**from a heart heart attack and we did it with a brain tumor guy Pablo Kelly who just passed away unfortunately from a**57:23**from a surgical um his his uh had a a major cerebral uh Hemorrhage after his**57:29**surgery from Devon England you know Devon England that's where I'm from are you from Devon yeah oh wow well Pablo**57:35**was there he just passed away fortunately we've talking to him the day before he passed away Pablo Pablo Kelly**57:41**so he was from Devon England had a gleo blastoma which is the worst of the worst uh they said and he's all over your your**57:48**newspapers there and Devon he was always sending me articles from England um man**57:53**rejects standard of care so he he had this gleo blastoma and they took the**57:58**tissue out which is brain cancer yeah brain the worst of the brain cancers you know uh they took the tumor out and they**58:04**said oh you it's in inoperable inoperable and uh but if you do**58:10**radiation in chemo uh we you might live nine maybe 12 months at the most well**58:15**Pablo came from a family of like we don't dabble and and this kind of medicine we're more holistic kind of**58:22**people so he emailed me this was in 2014 um and said I want to try this metabolic**58:29**thing so he rejected uh chemo and radiation and they said it wasn't**58:35**surgically capable of being completely removed anyway so he did this I I gave**58:41**him the information that I give to everybody and this was way back before we knew a lot of what we now know and uh**58:48**I said this poor guy he sees another one and they said you're going to be dead they they brow beat him they try to force him to put the radiation mask on**58:55**they hacked his beard off uh all this kind of stuff and he just jumped up he said I can't do this stuff so um he**59:01**didn't take any steroids he didn't take any any radiation he didn't take any chemo he just did the metabolic therapy**59:07**and he's on English telev or things with all of his paleo diet which actually a low very low carbohydrate diet he had**59:13**the avocados there he had the fish oil there he had this different stuff two three years go by he emails me**59:20**I said gez Pablo I thought you would have been dead you're still alive what's going on with that**59:27**so so he calls me up and he says you know um I went in for a CAT scan the**59:32**other day doctors are like still surprised that he's alive and they said this tumor is is still there and it's**59:38**growing and they think they can cut it out now so he was three years on on just**59:43**metabolic approach he didn't take any glutamine Inhibitors which was really remarkable so so anyway he asked me and**59:50**I have I have physician friends that a radiologist that can look at it and we measured it when it was first first**59:57**diagnosed in 2014 and then we saw it did become a little bigger so and the now**1:00:02**the surgeon said I think I can get it looks more more receptable here it was inoperable now it becomes receptable so**1:00:08**he took it out and um Pablo recovered really well and uh the surgeon says I**1:00:14**think I got it all wow so so and and Pablo is measuring his glucose Ketone**1:00:19**index with our Keo monitor so I had every day sometimes two and three five years of data on Pablo can you believe**1:00:26**this so so anyway Pablo thinks he's cured because the the surgeon all of a**1:00:33**sudden he goes back to his kind of weak weak ways and you can see the his gki**1:00:38**goes up and all of a sudden the tumor starts to show up again puts the fear of God back into him goes back on a more**1:00:44**restrict condition another three years goes by and this time the tumor is growing slowly very slow don't forget**1:00:51**gleo blastomas kill you very quickly um with standard of care you can barely get out of at his age if you can get two**1:00:57**years you're doing you're doing really good so anyway now he's three and he's got six years out and he says you know**1:01:04**um uh it's still back you know he I got to go in so it first so this is second debul first debul goes off gets back on**1:01:12**another second debulking another three years goes by he has a third debulking can you believe this the debulking**1:01:17**debulking is the cutting the tumor out it's the removal surgical removal of this tumor but he's never had radiation**1:01:23**or chemo or any of the kinds of stamp what we call standards of care so for**1:01:28**and now um he he has uh I talked to him a couple of weeks ago and uh he was**1:01:35**doing he was doing really really good he had the the third removal and we were laughing with myself and Dr duer and my**1:01:42**associates he says yeah can you imagine um uh I've had now three operations on a**1:01:49**previously inoperable tumor so we were saying wow they got**1:01:55**that wrong didn't they follow and they kept wanting to irradiate him and do all this stuff and he said no no going to keep doing this and so we were speaking**1:02:03**to him and and uh he's out 10 years the tumor was was diagnosed in in in August**1:02:10**2014 and he passed away August uh 2024 from they try to go in and get the**1:02:17**last bit of tumor out of his brain he came out of we got him uh we talked to him a thumbs up smiling talking like**1:02:23**crazy six hours later cereal hemr and need dies so uh he didn't die from the cancer he died from the a surgical**1:02:31**problem with the surgery so he was a you talk about long-term survivors uh you**1:02:36**rarely survive two years with a gleo blastoma the fact that he was out 10 years and if he hadn't had that last bit**1:02:42**of surgery the guy would have still been alive because he was talking like you and I are talking this is a guy who has a a terminal so I said to Pablo I said**1:02:50**you could outlive me I I says I said we're all terminal to some extent right we're never all of us aren't going to**1:02:55**live to I said sure he was a young guy he was only 20 22 or 23 when he was diagnosed he was in his 30s now when he**1:03:01**passed away 10 years so he's 33 34 years old and and I said you know I could be**1:03:07**dead before you and we were laughing and we had a good time and then next thing I know I got an email from his wife he**1:03:12**said Pablo is is on on on on brain dead and something I said what**1:03:17**the hell happened what happened to this poor guy and it wasn't the cancer so um**1:03:23**who how know I don't know what how long you would have lived how many more things but what I'm saying oh he's an**1:03:29**anecdote well listen if I had a drug that did what what metabolic therapy did and I could get more people like Pablo**1:03:35**are you kidding me they'd be run running all over the world and when you say metabolic therapy you mean the  <br>**What Is Metabolic Therapy?1:03:40**combination of the calorie restrictive yeah ketogenic approach yes avoiding well first of all you're avoiding you're**1:03:47**avoiding things that are going to kill you the radiation is going to kill you for the for many people not all people**1:03:52**okay everybody say well well listen you can you can look at go have people look at the data themselves for crying out loud and you can see how long you're**1:03:58**going to live he didn't do what they what they grab everybody in what did he do specifically he didn't take radiation**1:04:03**or chemo yeah and he brought his glucose Ketone index down to the 2.0 Zone and**1:04:08**kept it kept it low and he took some supplements and a few things here and there but he wasn't really targeting the**1:04:15**glutamine like we thought it with like we we thought we we found now certain parasite medications will be effective**1:04:20**in targeting glutamine so we're doing all non-toxic strategies to manage cancer you don't have to be brutalized**1:04:26**by the system if you know what to do and how to do it the problem the problem is most of the poor oncologists never heard**1:04:32**of what I'm talking the stuff I'm telling you right now they never heard of it the risk is someone gets cancer that's listening to this or someone has  <br>**What Should Someone That Has Cancer And Is Listening To This Do?1:04:37**cancer that that's listening to this I mean statistically there's a lot of people listening to this that have cancer right now and they're speaking to**1:04:43**their doctor and their doctor is saying chemotherapy radiation therapy etc etc gluc glucose has nothing to do with**1:04:50**tumor eat whatever you want yeah and so what' you say to those people who are they've just got a DI agnosis um and**1:04:57**their doctors are saying right listen this is pretty bad severe we're going to suggest that you take chemotherapy yeah**1:05:03**you're not telling them not to take chemotherapy are you I'm not telling them that and what we found what we found is that when you are in uh**1:05:10**nutritional ketosis with a glucose keto index of 2.0 or below my colleagues that**1:05:15**we work with in Istanbul Turkey were able to show that chemotherapies at much lower dosages can be even more**1:05:22**therapeutically powerful when you're in nutritional ketosis so you don't have to get rid of a lot of these different**1:05:27**procedures that we have today I'm just saying radiation for brain cancer I'm not saying radiation for lung or some of**1:05:33**the other cancers okay because if you can if you can shrink those tumors down and make them very weak and vulnerable a**1:05:39**surgical procedure a radiation procedure even lowd dose chemo could come in and even immunotherapy if you if you took a**1:05:46**big tumor and shrunk it down to a small small nub and it's resistant to a lot of the things they all have to share**1:05:53**something in common for them to survive have this this path that might be an immunotherapy could come in because**1:05:59**they're going to Target whatever all of them have together and you could possibly get rid of it that way I'm thinking of a friend of mine that um has**1:06:06**been diagnosed with brain cancer brain tumor and this is one of the most you**1:06:11**know it's a it's a woman in her 40s or 50s trying to keep her Anonymous as possible um who is just the most fit**1:06:20**athletic person that I I know eats amazingly well is literally known for**1:06:26**exercise um and I'd go how how is it possible that someone who I would probably say is fitter than I am if you**1:06:31**looked at their sort of metabolic Health has got a severe brain tumor well it it**1:06:37**they can stay healthy for uh and I'm not saying everybody who has and it depends**1:06:42**on what kind of a tumor it is as well is it a gly blastoma alod dendral Goma you know Panet there's a lot of different**1:06:49**kinds of tumors that want to know that it's it's not growing necessarily but it's big and it's in the brain and**1:06:54**they're going to remove for surgical operation well if they can what we always suggest for the brain cancer if you do metabolic therapy up**1:07:01**front and I've had uh surgeons tell me this uh you can shrink it down because**1:07:07**one of the um one it's angry it's an angry thing right and you can see some**1:07:12**slight Invasion if you can shrink that down so that it's more circumscribed now the surgeon can look at and go oh my God**1:07:18**we we know uh many many scientific Publications the more you can debolt that's called the removal of the tumor**1:07:25**debulking the longer the patient will survive the evidence is massive to support that but you know with a lot of**1:07:31**these brain tumors you don't get it all and there's always some little piece that remains and when you irradiate you**1:07:36**explode the ability to the cells to ferment energy and it's very hard to kill them but but if you can get the**1:07:43**majority of it out and then transition the patient back into a metabolic State keeping the pressure on those tumor**1:07:49**cells you can remain healthy like Pablo I mean these these guys can and when you found in mice is that when ketogenic  <br>**Keto Plus Hyperbaric Oxygen Study1:07:54**diet was combined with a hyperbaric oxygen therapy the average survival time was increased by roughly 80% yeah even**1:08:01**more sometimes now but what okay so why do we hyper do hyperbaric oxygen right**1:08:07**that's the question what's going on with hyperbaric oxygen why is this like a good thing it works best when the**1:08:13**patient and the mouse is in nutritional ketosis okay so look we have a tumor we**1:08:20**iriate that tumor how does the radiation kill the tumor cells it hits oxygen blows up and it causes a reactive R and**1:08:28**it's like a a stepping on a landmine it blows the tumor up right so um cancer**1:08:35**cells protect themselves even though they make a lot of rust they all they're this close to death anyway but they have**1:08:41**a very powerful antioxidant system and interestingly enough that besides**1:08:47**causing the disregulated growth the glucose and the glutamine also protect**1:08:52**them to some extent from the Ross that they're making and can you believe this the Ross r r reactive oxygen species**1:09:01**that are carcinogenic and mutogenic so they're they destroy our our our proteins lipids and and nucleic acids**1:09:09**they're disruptive molecules so radiation will cause a Ross in the micro environment Ros that'll blow up and kill**1:09:16**cells normal and and tumor cells but but if you want to selectively kill tumor cells you with Ross Not to cause your**1:09:24**hair to fall out your gums to bleed and all this crazy stuff you take the patient you put him in nutritional**1:09:30**ketosis and you say he's l a low gki then you go into hyperbaric oxygen which**1:09:35**dissolves oxygen directly into your blood now it's better than just breathing 100% oxygen because you can**1:09:40**actually dissolve oxygen in the bloodstream then you're taking away the two fuels that protect the tumor and**1:09:47**you're giving it internal Ross which kills the tumor internally only to the tumor cell not to your surrounding**1:09:53**tissues so you're killing selectively killing tumor cells without collateral damage to your to the rest of your body**1:09:59**as a matter of fact the rest of your cells are getting super healthy because they're burning ketones in pure oxygen**1:10:04**unbelievable how do we measure if our um can you believe this I can't even believe I'm saying this stuff**1:10:10**myself you really got to know the biochemistry and you have to know the physiology of your own body and you have**1:10:15**to understand evolutionary biology most people just aren't that intelligent including me it's not**1:10:21**intelligence most people most people kind of want things sort of simple principles that they can**1:10:27**live by and Implement and also quick and easy yeah of course okay they don't want to do what I'm talking about it because**1:10:33**it might be or the other thing let me tell you one thing and remember it if you do metabolic therapy success rides**1:10:39**heavily on your shoulders you're not sitting there like some Pawn with mannequin some guy's poison and radiating you to to make metabolic**1:10:46**therapy work you are the one doing the gki you're the one in your it's your**1:10:51**soul it's your you're responsible for your existence on this planet you're G to put your your precious soul in the**1:10:57**hands of someone who has less of a knowledge about the the problem than than you might as an entrepreneur I'm**1:11:04**always looking for ways to connect and to create and that's why I decided to launch the conversation cards I turned**1:11:09**to Shopify who also sponsored this podcast and Shopify made it so easy to**1:11:15**set up an online store and reach all of you no matter where you are in the world I remember the challenges we faced when**1:11:21**we first launched the DI Co conversation cards managing inventory ensuring a SC this checkout process and reaching our**1:11:27**audience Shopify stepped in and made everything so straightforward and efficient it was like having an entire**1:11:32**team of experts by our side allowing us to focus on creating

business to the next level and to say thank you for listening to this podcast we're giving you a trial which is just $1 a month and you can sign up**1:11:51**by going to shopify.com Bartlet the link is in the description destion below**1:11:56**could you be predisposed genetically to cancer yeah that's what those germine mutations but you can manage that people  <br>**Can You Have A Pre-Disposition To Cancer?1:12:03**think you know my my grandmother had breast cancer my mother had breast cancer so yeah you know they live in a common environment too it's not like**1:12:09**you're like in order to prove that you you you and all the siblings would have to be raised in a different environment**1:12:15**different countries different Lifestyles and then see if you all got cancer at the same time under all these different conditions that's definitely genetic**1:12:21**that's like Huntington's disease tayac disease or these kinds of things they'll manifest regardless of the environment**1:12:27**so you saying to me that I should as a 32y old man that's cancer-free um God willing I think God touchwood um I  <br>**Should I Restrict What I Eat, To Stave Off Cancer?1:12:34**should calorie restrict myself to keep my mitochondria healthy and my**1:12:40**metabolism healthy now I should be in a in a sort of restri I say it's good to**1:12:46**visit the state our Paleolithic ancestors had no choice there wasn't a**1:12:51**doughnut shop on every corner there wasn't pizzas there were there weren't the kinds of Highly processed carbohydrate Foods available to them so**1:12:58**should I be fasting should I be doing keto I you know I don't want to tell you what you should or should not do I'm not a physician here I'm a scientist I study**1:13:06**what causes these things and I study how to manage them you have to read what I'm saying and you have to come to your own**1:13:12**decisions about how you want to conduct your life I've given you information what's your view on fasting fasting is a  <br>**What's Your View On Fasting?1:13:19**powerful uh way to get your body into nutritional ketosis but it ain't easy try doing it try you try doing it see**1:13:26**how how easy it it ain't easy right uh but that's why we developed this procedure where if you go um rather than**1:13:33**going cold turkey uh say well today I'm gonna have a big I'm G eat as much as I can and then tomorrow okay you can go**1:13:39**the I can it's the second third days when you start to really know what the hell is going on believe me I've tried**1:13:44**it it's It Ain't Easy that's why we developed uh a zero carb diet for 14 days 10 to 14 days just zero eat meat**1:13:52**fish chicken whatever you want but just don't eat any bread pasta this kind of thing on keto um how do we get into that  <br>**How Do I Get Into The Keto State?1:14:00**sort of ketosis state that people often talk about measure your glucose Ketone index how do do that with the the the**1:14:06**keto Mojo meter you can buy it from Amazon okay okay you can buy now don't forget they get a free Libra meter now**1:14:12**for the blood they're working on Ketone blood meters but it's not there yet right now the keto Mojo or some other**1:14:18**keto meters where you could take a prick your finger like a diabetic you take a glucose strip and you put it on the**1:14:23**blood and you put it into the machine it tells you what your glucose is squeeze your finger a little bit more take the Ketone strip touch it to the blood put**1:14:30**it in the meter it gives you the Ketone value push the button gki comes right up okay okay very simple everybody can buy**1:14:38**it from from Amazon get the meter buy the consumables uh and then they can test it this is what Pablo this is what**1:14:44**all the the cancer patients the ones who really want to get into metabolic ketosis I think I've tried keto before**1:14:49**and I say think because I didn't measure my my keto level I was assuming I did yeah no it's really people say well I**1:14:55**haven't eaten you know I'm in ketos how do you know well I blew into this thing and the bulb came out I peed on a strip it looked like it was ketosis they are**1:15:02**indirect measures the most accurate is the blood measure so um it's hard to stay in that state for most people right**1:15:09**this is one of the things because the Temptations in our society are so strong yeah I mean Paleolithic man had no**1:15:16**choice do you think he that was his State that's all he knew for thousands and thousands tens of thousand hundreds**1:15:21**of thousands of years that's all he knew he didn't say let me go down to get a big jelly fil donnut down at the at the**1:15:28**end of the the river there no there's none of that he had to live in that state now we have so many Temptations**1:15:34**all the things that we are biologically clear for when you see obesity that's**1:15:39**evolution in action they are the descendants of our long ancestors that**1:15:44**could hold on to energy so efficiently we were an energy starved species for**1:15:50**the majority of our existence on the planet so anything we ate would be very little we never pee out glucose glucose**1:15:56**is converted to fat and we store energy as fat so those guys are energy efficient human beings now all of a**1:16:04**sudden we find oursel with everything and that's Evolution and action man that we're just we're just you're allowing to**1:16:11**see the how we can store energy so efficiently because our ancestors liveed**1:16:17**through such um environmental forcing we had famines we had long TRS**1:16:23**we our body could store energy so efficiently because it wasn't we had to store what little we could get from the**1:16:29**environment now you've got you know 300 million Americans in this food environment where when when they walk out their front door they see the Dunkin**1:16:35**Donut they can lie in bed and order a Dunkin Donut to their front during 10 minutes you don't even have to unas the**1:16:40**car they hand it through the window yeah no energy no energy expenditure energy in so so you know giving them this**1:16:47**information might be fairly futile because the tempt well that's I'm not here to tell people again I'm not here**1:16:53**to tell people what they should or should not do I'm just here to explain like why do we have all this not mystery**1:16:59**it's all biological evolution you understand biological evolution almost everything that I'm talking about makes**1:17:04**perfect sense um and unfortunately that's not part of our scientific literacy anymore so we need what  <br>**Do We Need More Discipline?1:17:10**discipline discipline is important um discipline is important um you know**1:17:16**every major religion had had a point of fasting um to be whether you're Islamic**1:17:25**Judaism or whatever Catholicism Hinduism whatever I don't whatever they always**1:17:31**had some sort of fasting why why you do fasting because you want to purify your body you want to become closer to God**1:17:36**you want to you want to you want to feel in control uh and that's always part and**1:17:41**if you do it with prayer it's even better so uh there was a reason for doing all that and uh people realized**1:17:48**the Ancients uh knew this kind of thing but uh we don't do that anymore uh we**1:17:53**don't go 40 days without food like Jesus did in the deserts um but a human being**1:17:59**you could absolutely do that I I know because I can look at your weight I can look at your size and I can pretty much**1:18:04**tell you how long you can go with before you died and how do I know that because George Cahill a good friend late George**1:18:11**kale ran the D jlin diabetes center and he he he evaluated people that would**1:18:16**just could water only fasting on until until death and um and some of those**1:18:22**conon MA prison and things so he was able to know how much you could how long**1:18:29**you could go now what about um Angus barbar went 377 days uh without food  <br>**What Happens When You Fast?1:18:36**George Cahill would fast some of these obese people for for 250 300 days what**1:18:41**happens inside their body with with they're burning fat so what happens is you burn fat okay liver stores a lot of**1:18:47**of um bone store the minerals that you can get minerals from your bones you can get a lot of fat storage um vitamins are**1:18:55**stored in fat a lot of vitamin D outside of the weight loss what's going on in you know we said PE religious people**1:19:01**used to fast to get closer to God yeah which seems to me to point to some sort of cognitive change yes and that's from**1:19:07**burning ketones yeah burn when you burn K I said in the brain when your brain starts shifting to ketones your energy**1:19:13**uh the bang for the buck for each calorie that comes in from a ketone body increases the efficiency of oxidative**1:19:19**phosphorilation so you more focused massively and you know this is**1:19:25**why our ancestors with the way that if you're if you are dependent on killing**1:19:30**some animal uh for your survival and you are out on the hunt you are focused uh**1:19:37**because if you're not focused you're going to starve to death so every organ sense organ in our body is super is**1:19:44**super jacked when you're in these ketotic states so and these guys walking around with headphones listen you know**1:19:51**all this I mean this is like depriving ourselves of the natural ways uh of our ancestry don't forget we're not just you**1:19:58**and I are not just here over the last you know 100 300 400 years we are the descendants of members that are same as**1:20:05**us you know hundreds of thousands of years ago they were they just didn't have the technology that we have today**1:20:11**but if you could brought a Paleolithic man from say 500,000 years ago and you gave him a bunch of donuts and told a he**1:20:18**would die went to heaven you mean to tell me I don't have to go out and kill the elk anymore they're going to hand me the food right through the window of**1:20:23**course he's going to do that you go in the cave and you throw a bunch of jelly fil Donuts into a bunch of**1:20:29**Caven who been chewing on the half eaten rat or something you think they're not**1:20:34**going to eat those jelly donuts they have a some chimpanzees live with a family down in Florida I know some**1:20:41**YouTube thing The Chimps they're eating the food with the family and then they give jelly sandwiches to The Chimps**1:20:47**banging on the table you think they were going to go crazy chimpanzees loving the jelly sandwiches do you have kids  <br>**What Advice Would Dr Seyfried Give To His Kids?1:20:53**yes what advice would you give to your children if they're listening to this now about um how to prevent their chance**1:21:00**of getting sick from cancer or these other well they probably say well Dad how come you don't do a lot of the things first of all I'm not telling I**1:21:05**told you I don't tell anybody what to do or or how they do it I'm just telling you the science behind why why things**1:21:12**work um yeah my my my my my children my two sons and my um they're all very very**1:21:19**successful and uh they they said if we ever got cancer we would be doing your we would be doing metabolic therapy if**1:21:25**we were to ever get cancer and I said just keep you know exercise and and do what you can do the best you can in our**1:21:31**environment I mean don't get me wrong I'm eat I'm eating a jelly donut I'm drinking beer I'm drinking whiskey why**1:21:38**because I like it but I'm not going to be doing it all the time you know it's just it's just I'm not going to be**1:21:43**saying oh I'm going to eat pizza sure but I'm not going to be uh uh not doing it I do water I do intermittent fasting**1:21:50**I don't eat for 18 20 hours at a time I do a lot of exercise over at the university the gym and the facilities**1:21:57**that we have um but I but I understand and then if I were to get cancer I would**1:22:02**have to um bite the bullet and do what I'm do what I know works as much as it wouldn't be pleasurable but it would be**1:22:08**certainly a better alternative than being radiated and poisoned I'm telling you that if that has built your  <br>**Why Isn't Dr Seyfried Trying To Be Metabolically Perfect?1:22:14**conviction to the point that you're so convinced that the real issue is this sort of metabolic dysfunction**1:22:20**um why aren't you optimizing your life to be sort of metabolically perfect well because I live in the same Society you**1:22:26**do yeah okay and and fortunately yes our technology has improved uh**1:22:33**significantly um you know I'm not a monk I'm not going to be in some Monastery you know chanting something um I I I am**1:22:41**a member of the society just as you are and I enjoy the things that we have to offer us to make our lives a little bit**1:22:48**more pleasurable there's nothing like sitting down over a nice meal and having a discussion with some wine and enjoying**1:22:53**it and en jooy the moment but don't but not to be locked into that kind of uh**1:22:59**diet and lifestyle all the time uh puts you at risk there's an election going on  <br>**What Food Laws Would Dr Seyfried Introduce?1:23:05**in the United States at the moment Trump versus Camala Harris um if you won the**1:23:10**election and you became president of the United States and you had to introduce some regulations or some laws around**1:23:16**food and all of these kinds of things what would you do well I I think you**1:23:21**know you're were talking about a food industry you're talking about a multi-dimensional economy I I would not**1:23:29**again you don't want government to tell you what you should do you should make**1:23:35**the choices but you have to recognize are there are there choices and what are these choices right now we're not in and**1:23:41**we're not seeing or understanding uh how things harm people if if we have an**1:23:47**obesity epidemic and that would put you at risk for all these horrific chronic diseases why do they not know that we we**1:23:55**introduced some regulation in the UK regarding smoking so you can't smoke inside anymore well that's but do you see this your secondhand smoke can**1:24:02**impact negatively the person sitting next to you this uh uh obese person's**1:24:07**personal choice to be obese is not going to make you obese or sick so this is a different kind of a situation um it that**1:24:15**has to come from internal to the person and they have to be concerned with their own health what about drugs though like**1:24:20**cocaine is not legal so why can't they intervene to say you can't have Dunkin Donuts um because they're both you know**1:24:29**gonna harm the indivual I think you'd get a revolution if you can't eat a Dunkin Donut you were not going to get a revolution if you can't have**1:24:35**C you try take go down here in Brooklyn and take away all these Donuts from people you know you're going to see**1:24:42**they're going to go you know it's it's like it's personal choices I I I I like**1:24:47**Dunkin Donut I mean I like the coffee especially but um but you can go to donnut shop and get some of these**1:24:53**crawlers and jelly fills and Honey Dipped are you kidding me these things are delicious you ever get these blueberry muffins you tremble while you**1:24:59**eat some of this stuff you know it's and I'm not going to take that away from me but if I want one I'm not going to be oh every day I got to eat no I just don't**1:25:06**eat it I on the weekend I might get one and even sometimes two or three weeks months go by before I'll get one you**1:25:12**know but uh but when you get it man you enjoy it you really love it are you  <br>**Is Dr Seyfried Hopeful?1:25:18**hopeful I am very hopeful because PE when the science comes you can't**1:25:23**suppress the truth it's going to come out the evidence the scientific evidence is there I'm documenting this scientific**1:25:30**and it's based on the shoulders of OT warberg are you kidding me I mean this was a giant in the field of biochemistry**1:25:35**it's not like I made this stuff up I'm just extending what he has done to a new dimension and putting it into a**1:25:41**practical application which he had never done so it's just an extension of of of**1:25:46**the knowledge base o over this time why' you care so much why do I care so much**1:25:52**you know I'm not in it for the you know what I'm in it for I want to see the the scientific**1:25:59**principles substantiated if you know that you can keep these people alive at a higher**1:26:05**quality of life based on the knowledge of the science that's doing that that's gratification man it's gratification to**1:26:13**know that these if because because you arise on understanding the mechanism of the problem and if you say you know if**1:26:20**we do it the way we're writing a big treatment protocol as we speak it's review a really comprehensive treatment**1:26:26**protocol and we Institute that in the clinic and for G blastoma patients and these Advanced cancers they're not**1:26:32**they're not living a few extra months they're living several years longer why because you knew the science what's**1:26:39**wrong with that that's that's gratification you don't have to make a billion dollars on that all you have to**1:26:45**know is that all those folks are living longer because you understood the science that was put into practical application what's WR that's our our**1:26:53**research is supported by philanthropy and private foundations that money allows me to to to do these experiments**1:26:59**to test what I'm testing on pre-clinical models and then we translate it back into the clinic directly and we see like**1:27:06**Pablo Kelly he should have been done he should have been done years and years ago he lived all those years extra he's**1:27:12**had a wife and he's got kids he didn't have to have his sperm Frozen he didn't have to have any of that stuff done**1:27:18**what's wrong with that keep I'm seeing people that are should have been dead a long time ago and they're still alive**1:27:23**and they're saying I'm doing fine I get calls from people geez I thought that guy would have been a goner he's still**1:27:28**alive he's doing well I said that that keeps me going because it tells me that we're on the right path this is a**1:27:35**solvable problem this cancer this cancer can be dropped significantly you can**1:27:41**take away the fear people now put the put it on their shoulders I know what to do how to do it I'm going to follow this**1:27:46**will it work for everybody no well it will help a lot of people much more than what we have today but it's Paradigm**1:27:52**change massive paradigm change so uh they will come to know it's just a**1:27:58**matter of time I don't know how long it's going to take but I ain't going anywhere I'm continuing to do this I'm going to get better and better results**1:28:04**and we're going to keep pushing I published these case reports in the scientific literature let the scientific field uh make their decision on the**1:28:11**results from these papers and if you are to succeed what happens people improve  <br>**And What If You Are Successful?1:28:17**um what I'm not going to live forever so but I know that what I've done with with**1:28:23**following Auto warberg and cleaning up the misconceptions and misunderstanding of why he he was stalled when the field**1:28:29**ran off chasing jeans we got to bring bring it back on track it's a metabolic problem with metabolic U Solutions so**1:28:37**that will help a lot of people but it's also going to change a lot of way people are thinking about this but I I can tell**1:28:43**you they want to open clinics I get calls from from Asia Africa South America they want to open clinics people**1:28:50**are being brutalized by a system that's not working don't forget besides the terrible Financial tox the personal**1:28:57**physical toxicity people have gone bankrupt their marriages are falling apart because they can't pay for the**1:29:03**expensive drugs on these cancer things and they die and the bills are passed on to their level this is immoral stuff is  <br>**Are There Any Studies That Have Broken Dr Seyfried's Heart?1:29:10**there a particular case study that's broken your heart more than any others Trudy Dupont who originally let me we we**1:29:18**built a glucose Ketone index calculator on her Pablo is I'm still we're still**1:29:24**ated by Pablo's loss because Pablo was a a guy that I've known for 10 years**1:29:29**worked him through and then all of a sudden he gets a cerebral hem and dies he was our poster child for how long you could live with a gleo blastoma on**1:29:36**metabolic therapy but he didn't die from the cancer um yeah have there's some others that we wished they could have**1:29:43**lived a little bit longer uh with the appropriate help what I find is that sometimes within the family there's a**1:29:49**lot of the guy he's I really want to do what you're doing but my wife and kids saying I'm foolish to do that so it's**1:29:56**it's still a very we're in a very early stage of this we haven't really worked**1:30:01**it out into a an effective standard yet it will come so people and the other**1:30:07**members of the family get super help when they all work together and they do it everybody says I never felt so**1:30:12**healthy in my life um gu tanom had Advanced prostate cancer he wrote a book and he's on the web and he had**1:30:19**hypertension high blood pressure overweight more obesity and all everything and then he does uh 18**1:30:25**several 18-day water only fasts got himself everything all these things went away his diabetes went away his**1:30:31**hypertension high blood pressure and the cancer can't be found so is he cured I have no idea but but he's managed yes**1:30:38**he's managed and he's healthier so what's wrong with that isn't that isn't that ultimately what medicine wants to**1:30:44**do keep people alive longer and a healthier quality of life yeah how many more do we need they say oh that's a  <br>**What Would Dr Seyfried Say To Someone Listening?1:30:51**fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke how many damn flukes do you want if there's someone listening now and I'm sure**1:30:57**there's going to be many thousands and tens of thousands of people listening um that are currently battling cancer have early**1:31:05**stage diagnosis I know I feel bad about this because people say oh I want to do medicab bolic therapy where can I go and**1:31:11**they go to their local hospital and get slapped down there's no evidence there's everything that's should come out of my mouth has never been taught to me in**1:31:17**medical school so what do you say to those people you know I say I I say the**1:31:24**I I'm sorry that the medical establishment has not come to recognize what I'm saying and then I tell them WR**1:31:31**your c i i you know it's it's the change has to be coming from the people ain't going to come from the top medical**1:31:37**schools they they are doing what they're doing very the status quo is very**1:31:42**profitable the status quo is very effective for these people but it's not helping the cancer patient uh as well as**1:31:48**it can and don't forget we're not throwing out all this stuff we're just asking people to know how to use the tools we have in a better way we don't**1:31:55**have to throw out immunotherapies radiation we don't have to throw out toxic poisons we just have to know**1:32:00**better how to use it when the patient is in this new state and the data will prove it but who's going to do that**1:32:07**who's going to do that the doctor says I'd love to do this if I but I'm going to lose my license if I do it what**1:32:12**what's going on with that they wrote the

advocates for metabolic therapies, including the ketogenic diet.  <br>  <br>## IDEAS:  <br>- Cancer’s rising incidence suggests lifestyle changes impact its development and prevention significantly.  <br>- Traditional views perceive cancer primarily as a genetic disorder rather than a metabolic one.  <br>- Studies show cancer is rare in traditional societies, implying diet affects cancer prevalence.  <br>- Metabolic therapy utilizes dietary changes to treat cancer more effectively than conventional methods.  <br>- A ketogenic diet lowers blood sugar, potentially reducing tumor growth and enhancing treatment efficacy.  <br>- Specific metabolic therapies can improve survival rates in terminal cancer patients significantly.  <br>- The glucose-ketone index helps monitor dietary impact on cancer progression and metabolic state.  <br>- Mitochondrial dysfunction is central to cancer development, indicating a focus on cellular metabolism.  <br>- Exercise plays a crucial role in reducing cancer risk by lowering blood sugar and glutamine levels.  <br>- Emotional stress and lack of sleep negatively affect mitochondrial health, increasing cancer risk.  <br>- Metabolic therapy can be a non-toxic alternative to conventional cancer treatments like chemotherapy.  <br>- Historical evidence suggests humans evolved with diets low in carbohydrates, impacting modern health.  <br>- The industrial food environment contributes to rising obesity and chronic diseases, including cancer.  <br>- Cancer cells thrive on glucose and glutamine, necessitating their restriction for effective treatment.  <br>- The scientific community faces resistance to the idea that cancer is primarily a metabolic disorder.  <br>- Changing dietary habits can prevent and manage cancer, emphasizing individual responsibility for health.  <br>  <br>## INSIGHTS:  <br>- Embracing a holistic understanding of cancer as a metabolic disorder can reshape treatment approaches.  <br>- Lifestyle choices significantly influence cancer risk, highlighting the importance of personal dietary decisions.  <br>- The effectiveness of metabolic therapies underscores the need for integrative medicine in cancer treatment.  <br>- Progress in cancer treatment can be achieved by refocusing on metabolic health rather than genetics.  <br>- Public health initiatives must address dietary habits to combat rising cancer rates effectively.  <br>- Understanding mitochondria’s role in energy metabolism can lead to breakthroughs in cancer management.  <br>- Encouraging healthier diets may mitigate the cancer epidemic and improve overall public health.  <br>- Personal responsibility for health choices is vital in preventing chronic diseases like cancer.  <br>- Research on cancer metabolism could revolutionize how we approach prevention and treatment.  <br>- Promoting exercise and stress management can enhance mitochondrial health and reduce cancer risk.  <br>  <br>## QUOTES:  <br>- “Cancer is very preventable when the medical establishment acknowledges what I know about this disorder.”  <br>- “Cancer was extremely rare in African tribes that were living according to traditional ways.”  <br>- “Metabolic therapy can be used as both prevention and treatment.”  <br>- “If you do metabolic therapy, you can actually reduce risk for cancer.”  <br>- “Cancer is a metabolic disorder, not just a genetic disease.”  <br>- “We can selectively restrict the two fuels while transitioning the body over to ketones.”  <br>- “The mitochondria is the center of the problem with cancer, not the nucleus.”  <br>- “Cancer cells depend on fermentation energy without oxygen.”  <br>- “Fasting is a powerful way to get your body into nutritional ketosis.”  <br>- “We evolved as a species to be in nutritional ketosis for the majority of our existence.”  <br>- “Our food science and technology has evolved faster than our biology.”  <br>- “Exercise lowers blood sugar and helps manage cancer risk.”  <br>- “Metabolic therapy is an effective non-toxic management for cancer.”  <br>- “The scientific evidence is there, and it’s just a matter of time.”  <br>- “Cancer can be managed effectively through dietary changes and metabolic therapies.”  <br>- “There’s no major advance in reducing cancer death rates.”  <br>  <br>## HABITS:  <br>- Regular exercise maintains mitochondrial health and supports overall metabolic function effectively.  <br>- Monitoring blood sugar and ketone levels can help manage cancer risk and treatment effectiveness.  <br>- Following a ketogenic diet may prevent cancer by restricting glucose and glutamine availability.  <br>- Practicing intermittent fasting can aid in achieving nutritional ketosis and improving metabolic health.  <br>- Reducing processed carbohydrates in the diet supports healthier mitochondrial function and cancer prevention.  <br>- Maintaining a balanced lifestyle includes managing stress, ensuring adequate sleep, and exercising regularly.  <br>- Engaging in community and social connections enhances emotional well-being and reduces cancer risk.  <br>- Prioritizing whole foods over processed options can improve overall health and reduce disease risk.  <br>- Staying informed about dietary impacts on health empowers better food choices and cancer prevention.  <br>- Making conscious food choices helps maintain metabolic health and support cancer management.  <br>  <br>## FACTS:  <br>- Nearly two million new cancer cases are diagnosed annually in the United States.  <br>- Approximately 1,700 people die from cancer daily in the U.S., highlighting its severity.  <br>- Cancer is projected to become increasingly prevalent globally by 2050 if current trends continue.  <br>- Traditional diets in some cultures correlate with significantly lower cancer rates.  <br>- Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to the development of various cancers worldwide.  <br>- The fermentation process is central to cancer cell metabolism, emphasizing dietary impact.  <br>- The American Cancer Society reports over 600,000 cancer-related deaths annually in the U.S.  <br>- Exercise can lower both blood sugar and glutamine, two fuels driving cancer growth.  <br>- High blood sugar levels correlate with faster tumor growth in both human and mouse studies.  <br>- Cancer cells can survive without oxygen, relying on fermentation for energy production.  <br>  <br>## REFERENCES:  <br>- "Cancer as a Metabolic Disease: On the Origin, Management, and Prevention of Cancer" by Thomas Seyfried.  <br>- Research papers from Boston College focusing on metabolic therapy and cancer.  <br>- The glucose-ketone index calculator developed by Seyfried and his students for patient monitoring.  <br>- Studies on the effectiveness of ketogenic diets in managing cancer and improving survival rates.  <br>- Reports on the impact of exercise on cancer prevention and overall metabolic health.  <br>  <br>## ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY  <br>Understanding cancer as a metabolic disease emphasizes the importance of dietary and lifestyle changes for prevention and management.  <br>  <br>## RECOMMENDATIONS:  <br>- Adopt a ketogenic diet to help manage blood sugar and reduce cancer risk effectively.  <br>- Engage in regular physical activity to enhance mitochondrial health and overall well-being.  <br>- Monitor glucose and ketone levels to optimize dietary choices and health outcomes.  <br>- Incorporate intermittent fasting into your routine to achieve nutritional ketosis.  <br>- Educate yourself on the metabolic aspects of cancer to make informed health decisions.  <br>- Reduce processed foods and sugars in your diet for better metabolic health.  <br>- Foster supportive social relationships to improve emotional health and reduce stress.  <br>- Prioritize sleep and stress management as essential components of cancer prevention.  <br>- Explore metabolic therapies as a complementary approach to conventional cancer treatments.  <br>- Stay proactive about health choices and seek knowledge on cancer prevention strategies.|**Description:** In this groundbreaking podcast episode, cancer expert Dr. Thomas Seyfried

What Alcohol Is Doing To Your Brain!  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/R6xbXOp7wDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch/R6xbXOp7wDA)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.240 there's a very famous experiment in  <br>00:00:02.200 which rats were engineered to have no  <br>00:00:04.200 dopamine and the scientists discovered  <br>00:00:06.160 that if they put food in the rat's mouth  <br>00:00:07.919 the rat would eat but if you put the  <br>00:00:09.280 food even a body length away the rat  <br>00:00:11.000 will starve to death which tells us that  <br>00:00:13.519 dopamine is fundamental to get the  <br>00:00:15.719 things that we need for our basic  <br>00:00:17.439 survival now every time we're doing  <br>00:00:19.640 something that's pleasurable from sugar  <br>00:00:21.439 to video games work pornography social  <br>00:00:23.599 media that will affect dopamine and the  <br>00:00:25.680 more dopamine that's released the more  <br>00:00:27.240 likely that drug or behavior is to be  <br>00:00:29.480 addictive but also the genetic risk of  <br>00:00:31.599 addiction is about 50 to 60% so if you  <br>00:00:34.200 have a biological parent or grandparent  <br>00:00:36.280 with addiction you are more likely to  <br>00:00:38.440 develop that addiction we have to keep  <br>00:00:40.399 it in balance in order to stay healthy  <br>00:00:42.600 Dr Anna lmy is Professor of Psychiatry  <br>00:00:44.600 at Stanford chief of the Stanford  <br>00:00:46.039 addiction clinic and a world leading  <br>00:00:47.719 expert on the subject of doping she will  <br>00:00:49.559 tell you how this one powerful chemical  <br>00:00:51.120 is controlling your life and what to do  <br>00:00:52.879 about it one of the most important  <br>00:00:54.399 findings in Neuroscience in the past 75  <br>00:00:56.840 years is that the same parts of the  <br>00:00:58.399 brain that process pleasure also process  <br>00:01:00.559 pain and the balance wants to remain  <br>00:01:02.920 level the problem is that we  <br>00:01:04.438 automatically seek out pleasure and  <br>00:01:06.000 avoid pain and we're exposed to all  <br>00:01:07.759 kinds of Pleasures that we have in the  <br>00:01:09.240 modern world and our brains are reeling  <br>00:01:11.119 in response to try to compensate now I  <br>00:01:13.000 need more of my drug and more potent  <br>00:01:14.479 forms to get the same effect which then  <br>00:01:16.320 leads to addiction and that's what  <br>00:01:17.720 happened to me when I got addicted to  <br>00:01:19.200 romance novels take me into that phase  <br>00:01:21.720 of your life I was out of control and I  <br>00:01:23.960 needed to restore a level balance and  <br>00:01:25.720 take the advice I give my patients and  <br>00:01:27.520 what is that

<br>00:02:14.200 minutes trying to figure out how to say  <br>00:02:15.720 this to you so I'm just going to say it  <br>00:02:17.000 how it comes out my mouth and I  <br>00:02:18.120 apologize if this is messy but if there  <br>00:02:20.280 was ever an episode this year that you  <br>00:02:22.440 should listen to it is this one I've  <br>00:02:24.840 since this episode was recorded about a  <br>00:02:26.360 month ago all I've been thinking about  <br>00:02:28.560 is how on Earth I get you to watch this  <br>00:02:30.640 and I don't say this often the last time  <br>00:02:32.160 I said this was the first time Mo gordak  <br>00:02:34.239 came on this podcast this is the second  <br>00:02:36.160 time I've said this in almost four years  <br>00:02:38.200 of recording this podcast on YouTube and  <br>00:02:40.200 the reason for that is so many of the  <br>00:02:42.560 things that I know you're struggling  <br>00:02:43.680 with in your life that stand in the way  <br>00:02:45.319 of the person you want to become that  <br>00:02:47.000 relationship you have with your phone  <br>00:02:49.319 the  <br>00:02:50.400 procrastination the cycles of behavior  <br>00:02:53.120 that make you feel embarrassed and full  <br>00:02:54.800 of shame that you've just never been  <br>00:02:56.040 able to crack all of them all of them I  <br>00:02:59.840 genuinely believe for many of you are  <br>00:03:01.159 going to be understood today if you  <br>00:03:03.120 listen to this episode it has changed my  <br>00:03:05.440 life and it has changed much of the  <br>00:03:07.360 lives of my team if if I'm wrong here  <br>00:03:11.080 you have the right to message me and  <br>00:03:12.840 tell me that I was wrong please listen  <br>00:03:15.280 to this episode really really I mean  <br>00:03:17.120 that from the bottom of my heart and  <br>00:03:18.560 just to make sure you do throughout this  <br>00:03:20.120 episode there's going to be these popups  <br>00:03:21.720 if you collect eight of these codes that  <br>00:03:23.560 are going to pop up on the screen and  <br>00:03:25.080 put them in the document link below  <br>00:03:26.959 you'll unlock something very special  <br>00:03:28.560 some additional content please listen to  <br>00:03:30.720 this  <br>00:03:34.959 episode Dr Anna  <br>00:03:37.439 lmy you wrote one of the most iconic  <br>00:03:39.959 well-known books about dopamine which  <br>00:03:43.040 propelled the subject matter of dopamine  <br>00:03:44.840 into the public  <br>00:03:45.959 Consciousness but I guess the most  <br>00:03:47.920 important question I should ask you  <br>00:03:50.360 is why does dopamine matter ah good  <br>00:03:54.680 question good good place to start I mean  <br>00:03:57.760 dopamine matters because it  <br>00:04:00.319 fundamental to our survival right so  <br>00:04:03.159 it's the chemical that we make in our  <br>00:04:04.760 brain that tells us this is something we  <br>00:04:07.400 should approach explore investigate so  <br>00:04:10.879 it's it's really almost the survival  <br>00:04:13.120 chemical so what is dopamine if you had  <br>00:04:15.360 to explain it to a 10-year-old how would  <br>00:04:17.160 you go about explaining it so dopamine  <br>00:04:19.478 is a chemical that we make in our brain  <br>00:04:23.240 um it has many different functions but  <br>00:04:27.080 one of its most important functions is  <br>00:04:29.479 that it helps us experience pleasure  <br>00:04:32.919 reward and  <br>00:04:34.800 motivation um it may be even more  <br>00:04:37.000 important for the motivation to do  <br>00:04:39.400 things than it is for the pleasure  <br>00:04:41.199 itself so for example there's a very  <br>00:04:43.840 famous experiment in which rats were  <br>00:04:46.199 engineered to have no dopamine in the  <br>00:04:49.160 brain's reward pathway and the  <br>00:04:51.360 scientists discovered that if they put  <br>00:04:53.479 food in the rat's mouth the rat would  <br>00:04:55.280 eat the food would seem to get some  <br>00:04:57.360 pleasure from the food if you can deter  <br>00:04:59.919 that from watching a rat eat which I  <br>00:05:01.919 think they felt like they could uh but  <br>00:05:04.039 if you put the food even a body length  <br>00:05:06.280 away the rat will starve to death the  <br>00:05:09.560 idea being that without dopamine we're  <br>00:05:12.479 not motivated to seek out the things  <br>00:05:15.400 that we need for our basic survival  <br>00:05:18.080 that's crazy so you get a rat you put  <br>00:05:20.440 the food an inch from its mouth and it  <br>00:05:24.039 will starve to death because it doesn't  <br>00:05:25.520 have dopamine the dopamine required to  <br>00:05:27.280 just reach out and eat yeah essentially  <br>00:05:29.800 maybe it's not an inch maybe it's a  <br>00:05:31.120 little more than an inch but the idea  <br>00:05:33.160 being that dopamine is necessary to be  <br>00:05:36.680 motivated to do the work to get the  <br>00:05:39.880 thing that we need and having an  <br>00:05:43.400 understanding of dopamine how might that  <br>00:05:45.840 improve my life having a basic  <br>00:05:48.479 understanding of how dopamine Works how  <br>00:05:51.360 we process Pleasure and Pain and also  <br>00:05:54.639 what happens with dopamine as we go from  <br>00:05:57.240 adaptive recreational use to Mal  <br>00:05:59.639 adaptive addictive use is something that  <br>00:06:02.560 is really useful especially for those of  <br>00:06:04.720 us living in the modern world where now  <br>00:06:07.240 we're exposed to so many reinforcing  <br>00:06:09.599 substances and behaviors that we've all  <br>00:06:12.000 become vulnerable to the problem of  <br>00:06:13.800 addiction and what are the biggest  <br>00:06:15.680 misconceptions of on the subject of  <br>00:06:17.479 dopamine because it's kind of thrown  <br>00:06:19.039 around in society I see it in my group  <br>00:06:20.840 chats people saying I need more dopamine  <br>00:06:22.840 or whatever or you know that person just  <br>00:06:24.960 craves dopamine what what are the  <br>00:06:26.720 biggest misconceptions you've come  <br>00:06:28.000 across the main miscon conception is  <br>00:06:30.199 that somehow we can get addicted to  <br>00:06:32.319 dopamine we're not getting addicted to  <br>00:06:34.680 dopamine itself dopamine is neither good  <br>00:06:37.240 nor bad it's a signal to tell us whether  <br>00:06:41.479 or not something that we're doing is  <br>00:06:44.120 potentially useful for our survival and  <br>00:06:47.120 also it's related to what we predicted  <br>00:06:51.360 about how rewarding or pleasurable  <br>00:06:53.759 something would be and so it's really um  <br>00:06:56.800 you know I sort of sometimes I joke it's  <br>00:06:58.360 like the um reward theory of relativity  <br>00:07:02.319 DOP mean is in the sense that Pleasure  <br>00:07:04.560 and Pain really are truly relative to  <br>00:07:07.199 one another and so dopamine gives us  <br>00:07:09.680 information about where we are in that  <br>00:07:12.280 relativity scale between Pleasure and  <br>00:07:14.360 Pain and when you say relative you mean  <br>00:07:16.440 I mean it's it's quite fitting for  <br>00:07:18.000 anyone that can't see we have a a set of  <br>00:07:19.960 scales on the table and scales are  <br>00:07:22.319 relative to each other because if you  <br>00:07:23.560 pour in one end the other end goes up  <br>00:07:26.000 and if you pour in the other end the  <br>00:07:27.000 other end goes up and this end goes down  <br>00:07:29.240 and when you say relative that's what  <br>00:07:30.800 you're describing right yes that's what  <br>00:07:32.680 that's what I'm describing yes okay and  <br>00:07:35.360 what activities that I do every day have  <br>00:07:38.160 an impact on my  <br>00:07:39.639 dopamine well probably almost everything  <br>00:07:43.479 you know in some ways um I mean every  <br>00:07:45.919 time we are doing something that's  <br>00:07:48.599 pleasurable reinforcing rewarding that  <br>00:07:52.000 will affect dope mean it's it's really  <br>00:07:54.240 the primary signal that lets us know  <br>00:07:57.080 that this thing is potentially important  <br>00:07:59.560 for our survival as I mentioned um but  <br>00:08:02.440 you know even um aversive stimuli can  <br>00:08:06.680 trigger dopamine what's oh something  <br>00:08:09.319 that's painful or not pleasurable  <br>00:08:11.159 dopamine gets involved in in that um  <br>00:08:14.159 equation anything that's novel or new is  <br>00:08:17.960 something that triggers our dopamine in  <br>00:08:20.560 in our reward pathway dopamine is  <br>00:08:23.039 fundamental for movement so not just  <br>00:08:26.120 pleasure and reward but also movement so  <br>00:08:28.800 for example Parkinson's disease which is  <br>00:08:31.560 a disease related to stiffness and  <br>00:08:34.320 Tremor is caused by a depletion of  <br>00:08:37.719 dopamine in a part of the brain called  <br>00:08:39.640 the substantia [ __ ] and as dopamine  <br>00:08:42.479 gets depleted in that part of the brain  <br>00:08:44.680 people lose the ability to move their  <br>00:08:47.240 bodies and it's probably no coincidence  <br>00:08:50.360 that the same neurotransmitter that is  <br>00:08:52.120 so important for pleasure reward  <br>00:08:54.200 motivation is also really important for  <br>00:08:56.680 movement because most organisms have to  <br>00:08:59.440 to locomote toward the object of their  <br>00:09:02.200 desire we want that thing we have to  <br>00:09:04.680 exert effort right we have to put in the  <br>00:09:06.959 work to go get it but in the world today  <br>00:09:09.680 we really don't have to do that right we  <br>00:09:11.880 can swipe right we can swipe left and  <br>00:09:13.959 all of a sudden it magically appears at  <br>00:09:16.079 the touch of a finger and that's very  <br>00:09:18.720 confusing for our brains because that's  <br>00:09:20.680 not how we evolved we really evolved for  <br>00:09:23.399 for having to do quite a bit of upfront  <br>00:09:26.240 work for a tiny little bit of reward  <br>00:09:29.920 I just want to before we move on talk  <br>00:09:32.079 about this point you said because I  <br>00:09:33.320 think it's quite foundational to  <br>00:09:34.600 everything we're going to talk about  <br>00:09:35.680 about dopamine being relative to pain  <br>00:09:38.200 and I have this set of scales in front  <br>00:09:39.839 of me and here I have some chemicals  <br>00:09:43.480 that are likely to produce dopamine in  <br>00:09:46.120 my brain I believe right so alcohol I  <br>00:09:49.040 have some rum I have some whiskey I have  <br>00:09:51.120 some vodka and can you explain to me  <br>00:09:53.839 using this rum whiskey and vodka how  <br>00:09:56.760 dopamine is relative to pain and what  <br>00:09:59.519 going on in my brain sure okay I'll  <br>00:10:01.360 slide this over to you oh  <br>00:10:03.320 okay so one of the most exciting  <br>00:10:06.839 findings in Neuroscience in the past 75  <br>00:10:09.560 years is that Pleasure and Pain are  <br>00:10:12.160 collocated in the brain so the same  <br>00:10:14.880 parts of the brain that process pleasure  <br>00:10:17.000 also process pain and in a very simple  <br>00:10:20.600 reductionist kind of way they work like  <br>00:10:23.160 opposite sides of a balance so imagine  <br>00:10:26.720 that deep in your brain's reward pathway  <br>00:10:29.040 which is is another exciting Discovery  <br>00:10:31.440 right that there's this dedicated reward  <br>00:10:33.120 pathway of the brain that consists  <br>00:10:35.279 broadly speaking of the prefrontal CeX  <br>00:10:37.680 which is this large gray matter area  <br>00:10:39.720 right behind our foreheads that's so  <br>00:10:41.399 important for future planning for  <br>00:10:43.680 delayed gratification for appreciating  <br>00:10:45.920 future consequences you might think of  <br>00:10:48.160 it as like the brakes on the car if  <br>00:10:50.200 we're going to analogize to to a to an  <br>00:10:52.839 engine and then deep you know in the  <br>00:10:55.880 brain we've got what we call the limic  <br>00:10:58.240 areas or the emotion brain and there you  <br>00:11:01.079 have the nucleus accumbens and the  <br>00:11:02.880 vental tegmental area that are rich in  <br>00:11:06.240 dopamine releasing neurons right and  <br>00:11:09.200 they act like the accelerator on the car  <br>00:11:11.639 so when you've got a healthy functioning  <br>00:11:13.760 brain you've got enough accelerator but  <br>00:11:17.240 not too much right so enough dop Meine  <br>00:11:19.200 being released but not too much and  <br>00:11:20.680 youve got a healthy prefrontal cortex  <br>00:11:23.079 putting the brakes on that dopamine  <br>00:11:25.560 release when people um become addicted  <br>00:11:29.680 there's either a problem with the brakes  <br>00:11:32.600 the prefrontal cortex or the accelerator  <br>00:11:35.120 the nucleus accumbens and vental  <br>00:11:36.600 tegmental area or both right what we're  <br>00:11:39.800 finding is that there's actually a  <br>00:11:42.720 disconnect so there are large neuronal  <br>00:11:45.160 circuits and Pathways between those deep  <br>00:11:47.440 lyic structures and the prefrontal  <br>00:11:48.920 cortex that literally get severed or  <br>00:11:51.320 disconnected when people become addicted  <br>00:11:54.560 as we think about Pleasure and Pain  <br>00:11:57.240 being collocated in the same parts of  <br>00:11:58.880 the brain working like opposite sides of  <br>00:12:00.920 the  <br>00:12:01.920 balance in order to understand what  <br>00:12:04.360 happens in the addicted brain is to  <br>00:12:06.279 appreciate that there are fundamental  <br>00:12:08.480 rules governing this balance and one of  <br>00:12:11.360 the most important rules is is that the  <br>00:12:13.279 balance wants to remain level it does  <br>00:12:15.959 not want to be tilted very long to the  <br>00:12:17.760 side of either pleasure or pain and in  <br>00:12:20.920 fact what our brain does is first tilt  <br>00:12:22.839 an equal and opposite amount to whatever  <br>00:12:25.519 the initial stimulus is so I'm going to  <br>00:12:27.519 try to illustrate that here so let's say  <br>00:12:28.959 our  <br>00:12:29.680 initial stimulus is alcohol now alcohol  <br>00:12:32.800 Works through its own chemical pathway  <br>00:12:35.079 it works on our endogenous opioid system  <br>00:12:37.440 the opioids that we make we have  <br>00:12:39.000 receptors for opioids in our brains it  <br>00:12:41.199 works on our endogenous Gaba system  <br>00:12:43.240 which is our calming  <br>00:12:44.920 neurotransmitter and at the end of the  <br>00:12:46.839 day it releases dopamine in the reward  <br>00:12:49.519 pathway so any potentially addictive  <br>00:12:52.199 substance will release dopamine in the  <br>00:12:54.399 reward pathway the more that's released  <br>00:12:57.360 and the faster that's released in a  <br>00:12:59.600 given individual the more likely that  <br>00:13:01.959 substance is to be  <br>00:13:03.519 addictive now another important concept  <br>00:13:06.240 here is what we call drug of choice  <br>00:13:08.000 which is to say what releases a lot of  <br>00:13:10.399 dopamine in your brain may not release a  <br>00:13:13.079 lot of dopamine in my brain and vice  <br>00:13:14.760 versa right which is this idea that  <br>00:13:16.800 people have predictions to different  <br>00:13:18.639 kinds of drugs and by the way people can  <br>00:13:20.600 get addicted to behaviors too I should  <br>00:13:22.680 emphasize that when you say drug of  <br>00:13:25.440 choice you mean the brain has a  <br>00:13:28.040 particular sensitivity to that drug in  <br>00:13:31.120 terms of dopamine yes okay the more  <br>00:13:34.279 dopamine that's released the faster that  <br>00:13:36.079 it's released the more likely that drug  <br>00:13:38.000 is to be addictive for a given  <br>00:13:39.639 individual so you're holding some  <br>00:13:41.079 whiskey there I'm holding some whiskey  <br>00:13:42.839 there could be a brain that is very  <br>00:13:44.600 sensitive to Whiskey and there could be  <br>00:13:46.760 a different brain that you could pull  <br>00:13:48.320 all the whiskey and you like and the  <br>00:13:49.720 dopamine response is sort of limited  <br>00:13:52.759 exactly okay and for many of my patients  <br>00:13:56.519 who become addicted to alcohol they will  <br>00:13:58.759 tell you that from the first moment they  <br>00:14:01.040 had alcohol they knew they were either  <br>00:14:03.480 in trouble or had met their best friend  <br>00:14:05.720 or some combination it was a very potent  <br>00:14:09.040 experience for them all right so let's  <br>00:14:11.680 let's go ahead and put this on the  <br>00:14:13.160 pleasure side of the  <br>00:14:14.680 balance dopamine is being released but  <br>00:14:16.920 no sooner has that happened then my  <br>00:14:19.000 brain will work very hard to restore a  <br>00:14:22.160 level balance and by the way a level  <br>00:14:24.160 balance is what neuroscientists call  <br>00:14:26.720 homeostasis okay and one of the  <br>00:14:29.120 overarching physiologic drives for all  <br>00:14:31.160 living organisms is to return to  <br>00:14:32.959 homeostasis homeostasis is that  <br>00:14:35.360 parameter of what's often called called  <br>00:14:38.440 affordances or states of being that are  <br>00:14:41.600 adaptive and healthy for the organism  <br>00:14:43.839 for example like we have a certain  <br>00:14:45.920 homeostasis of body temperature and if  <br>00:14:47.920 we go much too much beyond that either  <br>00:14:50.959 too high or too low we will disintegrate  <br>00:14:53.120 and die right so homeostasis is that  <br>00:14:55.639 that states of being that are compatible  <br>00:14:58.480 with existence  <br>00:14:59.720 and and potentially advantageous too  <br>00:15:01.560 sort of Baseline level that's right yeah  <br>00:15:04.079 Baseline level and by the way we're  <br>00:15:05.360 always releasing dopamine at a kind of  <br>00:15:07.040 tonic Baseline level in our brains I  <br>00:15:08.880 sometimes think of it as the heartbeat  <br>00:15:10.040 of the brain so what's happened here for  <br>00:15:11.920 people that can't see is you've poured a  <br>00:15:13.199 little bit of whiskey into one end of  <br>00:15:14.519 the scale the pleasure side of the scale  <br>00:15:17.040 and the other side of the scale has  <br>00:15:18.680 risen because now there's whiskey um in  <br>00:15:21.120 the the pleasure side which I guess is  <br>00:15:22.720 released dopamine exactly so now now we'  <br>00:15:25.519 released dopamine in the reward pathway  <br>00:15:27.880 okay because the pain side went up does  <br>00:15:29.920 that mean there's now less pain in the  <br>00:15:31.480 brain well I think you know again this  <br>00:15:34.040 is a metaphor it's an oversimplification  <br>00:15:36.560 the idea here is just when we press on  <br>00:15:38.920 the pleasure side we're releasing  <br>00:15:40.839 dopamine in the reward pathway and  <br>00:15:42.279 experiencing pleasure okay okay but no  <br>00:15:45.240 sooner has that happened then our brain  <br>00:15:47.199 will try to compensate or adapt to  <br>00:15:50.600 increased dopamine firing by down  <br>00:15:52.959 regulating dopamine transmission for  <br>00:15:54.880 example by involuting post synaptic  <br>00:15:57.560 dopamine receptors that mean okay okay  <br>00:16:00.759 so our brain is a bunch of wires you  <br>00:16:04.240 know um that conduct these electrical  <br>00:16:06.639 signals and and these long spindly cells  <br>00:16:09.120 are called neurons and the thing about  <br>00:16:11.199 neurons is that they don't actually  <br>00:16:13.120 touch end to end there's a little Gap or  <br>00:16:15.519 space between them and that Gap is  <br>00:16:17.000 called the synapse and that Gap or  <br>00:16:20.199 synapse is bridged by what we call  <br>00:16:21.880 neurotransmitters and dopamine is one of  <br>00:16:23.800 those neurotransmitters okay and when  <br>00:16:27.120 the pre synaptic neuron pulses and  <br>00:16:29.759 releases dopamine it crosses the synapse  <br>00:16:32.759 and binds to a receptor on the post  <br>00:16:35.360 synaptic neuron which either continues  <br>00:16:38.000 or aborts that electrical signal does  <br>00:16:40.160 that make sense yes okay so one of the  <br>00:16:42.920 ways that our brain can decrease the  <br>00:16:46.040 effects of dopamine decrease dopamine  <br>00:16:48.160 transmission is by involuting or taking  <br>00:16:51.480 inside the neuron the post synaptic  <br>00:16:54.399 receptor that way when dopamine is  <br>00:16:56.360 released it has nowhere to bind oh okay  <br>00:16:58.480 so it's like removing the docking  <br>00:17:00.079 station exactly very good it's removing  <br>00:17:02.800 the docking station so essentially  <br>00:17:04.480 getting back to our scale we've we've  <br>00:17:06.480 you know ingested alcohol we've  <br>00:17:08.199 increased dopamine firing in the reward  <br>00:17:10.280 pathway but remember our pleasure pain  <br>00:17:12.319 balance wants to return to the level  <br>00:17:14.400 position level with the ground  <br>00:17:16.679 homeostasis so it's going to decrease  <br>00:17:19.160 dopamine transmission by for example  <br>00:17:21.520 involuting those post synaptic dopamine  <br>00:17:24.319 receptors but one thing about the brain  <br>00:17:27.079 in its process of trying to get back to  <br>00:17:29.799 homeostasis and again I like to think of  <br>00:17:31.760 this neuro adaptation process as these  <br>00:17:33.760 Gremlins hopping on the pain side of the  <br>00:17:36.400 balance to bring it level again you  <br>00:17:38.039 don't have Gremlins here you have these  <br>00:17:39.360 little rocks but let's go ahead and put  <br>00:17:41.480 a rock on the pain side of the balance  <br>00:17:43.240 and the these rocks are are friends  <br>00:17:45.880 right their job is to level the balance  <br>00:17:47.880 because remember we got to go back to  <br>00:17:48.799 homeostasis I'm going to put a rock on  <br>00:17:50.600 and you're going to see oh my gosh it  <br>00:17:53.000 overshot right it now I've got it  <br>00:17:55.880 pressed down on the the pain side of the  <br>00:17:57.840 balance but that's exactly what happens  <br>00:18:00.480 in our brains in this process of neuro  <br>00:18:02.559 adaptation those Gremlins hopping on the  <br>00:18:04.960 pain side of the balance don't get off  <br>00:18:07.120 as soon as the balance is level they  <br>00:18:08.720 stay on until we're tilted and equal an  <br>00:18:11.360 opposite amount so is that what a  <br>00:18:13.080 hangover is or a cown as they would say  <br>00:18:16.360 when people take drugs they say I have a  <br>00:18:18.120 come down exactly that's exactly what it  <br>00:18:21.520 is that's the hangover the come down the  <br>00:18:23.760 Blue Monday or on a much smaller scale  <br>00:18:26.799 just that moment of craving right that  <br>00:18:29.080 moment of wanting to have one more shot  <br>00:18:31.960 right why does it overshoot why can't it  <br>00:18:33.720 just perfectly hit homeostasis such a  <br>00:18:36.360 great question because then we'd feel  <br>00:18:38.159 fine yeah why did Mother Nature do that  <br>00:18:40.400 to us so cruel right yeah okay I'm going  <br>00:18:45.640 to tell you an evolutionary just so  <br>00:18:47.480 story what we mean by that is we don't  <br>00:18:49.320 really know why you know this mechanism  <br>00:18:51.880 exists but from an evolutionary  <br>00:18:54.520 perspective if you're living in a world  <br>00:18:56.720 of scarcity and everpresent danger this  <br>00:19:00.039 is the perfect mechanism to make sure  <br>00:19:03.200 that we're never satisfied with what we  <br>00:19:05.520 have that we're always wanting more it's  <br>00:19:08.640 made us the ultimate  <br>00:19:10.480 Seekers okay because immediately after  <br>00:19:12.880 getting something I'm now feeling a lack  <br>00:19:15.720 of pleasure and I'm at a deficit you  <br>00:19:17.960 know on the pain side of the scale which  <br>00:19:19.760 means that I'm going to go seeking out  <br>00:19:21.400 more dopamine and in a world where  <br>00:19:23.960 everything is quite scarce that could  <br>00:19:25.799 mean going on another 4-Hour hunt the  <br>00:19:27.960 next day to go killer gazelle or  <br>00:19:29.480 something perfect you got yeah you got  <br>00:19:31.960 it interesting yeah okay so that's going  <br>00:19:34.960 to motivate me because this get so Jesus  <br>00:19:39.000 people that have hangovers don't seem  <br>00:19:40.320 very  <br>00:19:41.440 motivated right so now that's a so why  <br>00:19:44.240 is that right it's because alcohol is a  <br>00:19:49.600 product of human  <br>00:19:51.960 engineering that releases so much  <br>00:19:54.640 dopamine all at once in the reward  <br>00:19:56.880 pathway that our brains are reeling to  <br>00:20:00.240 compensate right we we really weren't  <br>00:20:03.080 evolved for this much pleasure with this  <br>00:20:06.720 much easy access as you said yourself we  <br>00:20:09.240 were really evolved for to have to do  <br>00:20:12.200 quite a lot of work upfront and to be  <br>00:20:15.039 hungry and to be lonely and to be tired  <br>00:20:17.600 and then get a little bit of reward that  <br>00:20:20.039 would then bring us back up to  <br>00:20:22.440 homostasis so really we were evolved to  <br>00:20:25.159 be pressing on the pain side of the  <br>00:20:26.760 balance in our effort to find pleasure  <br>00:20:29.440 and then when we find it that little bit  <br>00:20:31.720 of food or clothing or shelter or a mate  <br>00:20:34.320 would bring us back to the level  <br>00:20:35.840 position does that makes sense yeah so  <br>00:20:37.520 you're you're telling me essentially  <br>00:20:38.679 that we're all wired to be addicted  <br>00:20:42.679 because if this is how our brain works  <br>00:20:44.400 in a world it's designed to seek out  <br>00:20:48.039 more dopamine but the problem we have  <br>00:20:50.000 now is we have all the synthetic  <br>00:20:51.600 dopamine effectively like this so  <br>00:20:53.840 synthetic chemicals and synthetic things  <br>00:20:55.880 and you know an Internet that is wiring  <br>00:20:58.679 us to give us so much dopamine so easily  <br>00:21:01.640 that that means that our brains are  <br>00:21:02.760 effectively like mismatched to the world  <br>00:21:05.320 that we live in and therefore wired to  <br>00:21:06.760 be addicted yeah I think you actually  <br>00:21:08.039 said that I found a quote you said in an  <br>00:21:10.440 interview where you said we all wired to  <br>00:21:12.880 be addicted and if you're not addicted  <br>00:21:14.440 yet it's right around the corner right  <br>00:21:17.120 coming to a website near you yes I I  <br>00:21:19.760 guess I would I would qualify that a  <br>00:21:21.840 little bit by saying we're wired for  <br>00:21:24.480 survival in a world of scarcity that's  <br>00:21:27.919 not the world live in now we live in a  <br>00:21:29.679 world of overwhelming overabundance and  <br>00:21:32.320 so there is a mismatch between this  <br>00:21:34.480 ancient wiring that has us relentlessly  <br>00:21:36.679 pursuing pleasure in order to survive  <br>00:21:40.279 and a world that's so infused with  <br>00:21:42.600 pleasure and so many rewarding stimuli  <br>00:21:44.960 that now we're overwhelming our reward  <br>00:21:47.120 system and our brains are reeling in  <br>00:21:49.360 response to try to compensate so what  <br>00:21:51.679 happens to this scale then in such a  <br>00:21:53.559 world where I can get a big hit of  <br>00:21:55.320 dopamine all the time using some of  <br>00:21:57.600 these synthetic things or the internet  <br>00:21:59.279 or pornography or whatever else what's  <br>00:22:01.120 going on with this scale over and over  <br>00:22:02.679 again okay great so let me get there let  <br>00:22:04.960 me first say though that remember after  <br>00:22:07.559 we do something that's highly  <br>00:22:09.279 pleasurable our brain compensates with  <br>00:22:11.480 neuro adaptation tilting an equal and  <br>00:22:13.720 opposite amount to the side of pain and  <br>00:22:16.480 then restoring our balance back to the  <br>00:22:19.440 level position right or what we call  <br>00:22:21.400 homeostasis so this doesn't last forever  <br>00:22:23.919 right it's to pleasure then it's to pain  <br>00:22:26.240 then it's back to the level position but  <br>00:22:28.720 if we continue to consume our drug of  <br>00:22:31.240 choice over days to weeks to months to  <br>00:22:34.120 years and we add in a whole bunch of  <br>00:22:36.760 other drugs and now we're consuming you  <br>00:22:40.039 know pornography and smoking pot and  <br>00:22:43.120 eating um donuts and you know you name  <br>00:22:47.520 it all at the same time then essentially  <br>00:22:50.559 what happens is those Gremlins on the  <br>00:22:53.559 pain side of the balance end up camped  <br>00:22:56.480 out there for anyone that see she put  <br>00:22:59.120 all of the Rocks into the pain side to  <br>00:23:01.279 represent All Of The Addictive behaviors  <br>00:23:03.279 that this individual has now taken on  <br>00:23:06.320 right and now we've entered addicted  <br>00:23:10.039 brain by which I mean that we've changed  <br>00:23:12.919 our honic or Joy set point to the side  <br>00:23:17.440 of pain now we need more and more of our  <br>00:23:21.240 drug in more potent forms not to get  <br>00:23:24.520 high and feel good but just to level the  <br>00:23:28.000 balance feel normal and this is not  <br>00:23:29.720 going to be enough to level the balance  <br>00:23:31.720 I would have to like keep filling this  <br>00:23:34.200 much more than this container can hold  <br>00:23:36.600 and that would be in Pursuit really of  <br>00:23:38.480 just trying to level that balance so  <br>00:23:40.720 that we can feel normal and when we're  <br>00:23:42.200 not using we're walking around with a  <br>00:23:44.559 balance tilted toward the side of pain  <br>00:23:47.120 experiencing the universal symptoms of  <br>00:23:49.520 withdrawal from any addictive substance  <br>00:23:52.159 or behavior which are anxiety  <br>00:23:55.080 irritability insomnia depression and  <br>00:23:58.120 crav  <br>00:23:59.360 so if I managed to get enough vodka  <br>00:24:01.799 whiskey rum and pour it into the  <br>00:24:03.840 pleasure side of the scale now that all  <br>00:24:05.360 the rocks are in the pain side of the  <br>00:24:06.720 scale I managed to outweigh  <br>00:24:09.120 it it would it would what would then  <br>00:24:11.960 happen more rocks more rocks would be  <br>00:24:14.240 added yes more so momentarily yeah I  <br>00:24:17.640 would maybe be in a little bit of  <br>00:24:19.279 pleasure yes but then my brain would  <br>00:24:21.000 remove those docking stations again  <br>00:24:22.679 remove more of them and more rocks would  <br>00:24:24.360 go in and I'd slam  <br>00:24:26.000 down on the pain side again which means  <br>00:24:28.399 I need more alcohol to try and get up to  <br>00:24:30.799 pleasure SL okay so really you want to  <br>00:24:33.679 you want to like dopamine fast you need  <br>00:24:37.440 you need to just balance this and this  <br>00:24:39.080 is so difficult because of the world we  <br>00:24:40.480 live in it's almost it's it's it's funny  <br>00:24:42.880 enough because this little scales  <br>00:24:44.559 experiment um analogy here has given me  <br>00:24:46.960 a huge amount of empathy for people that  <br>00:24:48.159 are addicts oh gosh I'm so glad you said  <br>00:24:50.520 that because I think that is the key to  <br>00:24:53.799 empathy for the disease of addiction as  <br>00:24:56.520 well as for people with the disease  <br>00:24:57.919 having empathy for themselves is  <br>00:25:00.399 recognizing that on some level it it's  <br>00:25:04.799 it's out of their control right because  <br>00:25:07.120 when we are tilted to the side of pain  <br>00:25:09.559 the overwhelming drive to restore a  <br>00:25:12.559 level balance or restore homeostasis as  <br>00:25:14.840 quickly as possible overwhelms any other  <br>00:25:18.000 rational thought about the consequences  <br>00:25:20.320 of my drug use right it's just like get  <br>00:25:22.799 back to the level position because if I  <br>00:25:25.240 do that I'll at least feel temporarily  <br>00:25:27.559 better  <br>00:25:29.399 one of the things this analogy also  <br>00:25:31.520 highlights for me is that people who are  <br>00:25:34.399 addicted aren't trying to self harm  <br>00:25:37.720 right and this is kind of the prevailing  <br>00:25:39.679 narrative that if you're like why would  <br>00:25:41.880 you do that to yourself right whereas  <br>00:25:43.720 when I look at this analogy I go  <br>00:25:45.480 actually what they're trying to do is  <br>00:25:47.840 to deal with pain and we're all trying  <br>00:25:50.440 to find ways to deal with our pain and  <br>00:25:53.240 but in this analogy what ultimately  <br>00:25:54.799 happens and I guess is what's happening  <br>00:25:56.240 with addicts is the way they're choosing  <br>00:25:58.000 to deal with their pain is becoming  <br>00:26:00.399 self-destructive and that's creating  <br>00:26:01.919 more pain right and it's this vicious  <br>00:26:04.080 downward cycle yes and I think that sort  <br>00:26:05.960 of reframing of what's going on there is  <br>00:26:07.600 really critical because again it begets  <br>00:26:09.159 more empathy absolutely I agree with you  <br>00:26:12.559 and and I think you know we this this  <br>00:26:15.480 metaphor it makes an assumption that we  <br>00:26:18.480 all start with a pleasure pain balance  <br>00:26:20.000 that's level with the ground but  <br>00:26:21.440 actually that's probably not true right  <br>00:26:24.399 some people at Baseline may actually be  <br>00:26:26.919 more depressed or more anxious or may  <br>00:26:29.080 have had life experiences that sets them  <br>00:26:31.360 up for a kind of chronic stress reaction  <br>00:26:34.760 and we know that people with  <br>00:26:35.919 co-occurring psychiatric disorders for  <br>00:26:37.799 example are at increased risk of  <br>00:26:39.799 developing addiction probably because  <br>00:26:41.559 they're reaching for that substance to  <br>00:26:43.960 self medicate their psychiatric problem  <br>00:26:47.600 the the issue with that is that it's not  <br>00:26:50.320 medicinal right it's not healing  <br>00:26:53.159 although in the short term substances  <br>00:26:56.159 can help with those kinds of feelings  <br>00:26:58.240 feelings of psychological and physical  <br>00:27:00.720 pain over time because of the way the  <br>00:27:03.760 brain adapts as we've  <br>00:27:06.320 discussed substances and other addictive  <br>00:27:09.200 behaviors just make psychiatric problems  <br>00:27:11.600 worse right as we drive ourselves  <br>00:27:13.880 further into the the kind of uh you know  <br>00:27:16.679 the pain side of the balance so is this  <br>00:27:18.520 why trauma often leads to addictive  <br>00:27:20.440 behaviors because the trauma has caused  <br>00:27:23.200 a a pain a stress and we're searching  <br>00:27:26.720 for ways to  <br>00:27:29.200 medicate that pain or stress yeah to  <br>00:27:31.279 numb ourselves to not be present in our  <br>00:27:33.640 reality and have to deal with what's  <br>00:27:35.559 going on there is dopamine what role is  <br>00:27:37.880 dopamine playing in it's all the same  <br>00:27:39.760 dopamine  <br>00:27:41.039 originally was to help us find those  <br>00:27:43.519 things that we need to survive food  <br>00:27:46.039 clothing shelter a mate we call those  <br>00:27:48.559 Natural Rewards but  <br>00:27:51.760 today that same reward pathway that  <br>00:27:54.720 relies on dopamine has been hijacked by  <br>00:27:57.440 all of these  <br>00:27:58.640 artificial rewards that our brain  <br>00:28:01.600 confuses as necessary for survival which  <br>00:28:05.080 is why people with severe addiction will  <br>00:28:07.840 be willing to lose you know not  <br>00:28:10.159 consciously but unconsciously their  <br>00:28:12.840 loved ones their homes their jobs  <br>00:28:15.480 everything they have in pursuit of their  <br>00:28:17.159 drug of choice it's because their brain  <br>00:28:19.399 has been hijacked and they now confuse  <br>00:28:23.080 the drug as necessary for survival the  <br>00:28:26.240 other thing about drugs is that they're  <br>00:28:28.399 incredibly potent they release a lot of  <br>00:28:30.440 dopamine all at once which again is  <br>00:28:32.919 confusing for our brain Natural Rewards  <br>00:28:36.519 require upfront effort where we do a lot  <br>00:28:38.720 of work and then we get a little bit of  <br>00:28:41.399 dopamine and that's what our brains  <br>00:28:43.200 evolved for I mean I can that makes  <br>00:28:45.399 sense in my own life when I'm most  <br>00:28:47.919 stressed or most challenged by something  <br>00:28:50.679 professionally is when I I immediately  <br>00:28:52.880 notice that my diet goes out the window  <br>00:28:54.840 I start eating things that are bad I  <br>00:28:56.279 actually stop going to the gym as much  <br>00:28:58.640 um and it's it be can form a bit of a  <br>00:29:01.320 downward spiral can't it I guess as  <br>00:29:03.080 we've kind of seen from the dopamine  <br>00:29:04.679 scale um can I can I get back to that  <br>00:29:07.760 your question though about trauma and  <br>00:29:09.440 stress so um there's a very series  <br>00:29:13.279 there's a very interesting series of  <br>00:29:14.840 experiments in rodents mice and rats  <br>00:29:18.960 where they first of all rodents very  <br>00:29:22.760 easily get addicted to cocaine they will  <br>00:29:25.279 press a lever for cocaine until  <br>00:29:27.440 exhaustion or death but if that cocaine  <br>00:29:31.039 is then taken away that behavior will  <br>00:29:34.720 extinguish which means that the mice  <br>00:29:37.200 will eventually just stop pressing the  <br>00:29:38.840 lever right because they're not getting  <br>00:29:40.120 any cocaine totally makes sense and then  <br>00:29:42.240 they'll go off and do something else in  <br>00:29:43.640 the cage but if they're then exposed to  <br>00:29:46.919 a very painful foot shock right so a  <br>00:29:50.159 very extreme physical pain which you  <br>00:29:52.159 could equate to a serious life stressor  <br>00:29:55.559 the first thing the rat will do is run  <br>00:29:58.320 over to the lever and start pressing for  <br>00:30:02.919 cocaine which tells us that once our  <br>00:30:06.120 brain has discovered a drug that  <br>00:30:08.679 releases a lot of dopamine in our reward  <br>00:30:12.279 pathway even after we stop using that  <br>00:30:15.480 drug if we are exposed to an extreme  <br>00:30:20.360 stressor our brain will tell us  <br>00:30:23.080 immediately go and do that thing that  <br>00:30:25.799 gives us a lot of dopamine because you  <br>00:30:28.000 are under stress and I need to be  <br>00:30:30.279 relieved of stress does that make sense  <br>00:30:32.080 makes perfect sense yeah so if you  <br>00:30:33.799 especially so if you discover your drug  <br>00:30:35.159 of choice when you're younger and it's  <br>00:30:36.799 food or it's pornography or if it's I  <br>00:30:39.840 don't know anything that really made you  <br>00:30:41.679 feel good for a moment a moment of  <br>00:30:43.640 pleasure that will always become in the  <br>00:30:46.519 case of these rodent  <br>00:30:48.960 experiments the thing you run back to  <br>00:30:51.519 when life gets hard right and we see  <br>00:30:54.039 that again and again in people in  <br>00:30:56.159 sustained recovery from addtion that  <br>00:30:59.600 when they are under stress that is a  <br>00:31:03.639 trigger potentially for them to relapse  <br>00:31:06.200 so they have to be really thoughtful in  <br>00:31:08.000 their lives for number one trying to  <br>00:31:10.039 avoid stressful situations and and by  <br>00:31:12.559 the way stress can come in many  <br>00:31:14.639 different forms there's a great acronym  <br>00:31:16.240 in in alcoholic synonymous called halt  <br>00:31:19.039 hungry angry lonely tired those kinds of  <br>00:31:23.880 stressors everyday stressors which we  <br>00:31:26.279 all experience hungry angry lonely tired  <br>00:31:29.480 can trigger us to want to use so people  <br>00:31:31.960 in recovery have to be really thoughtful  <br>00:31:33.760 about not getting too hungry not getting  <br>00:31:35.880 too angry not getting too lonely and not  <br>00:31:38.600 getting too tired at the end of this  <br>00:31:40.440 conversation I want to go through all of  <br>00:31:41.519 the sort of practical solutions that  <br>00:31:43.360 someone struggling with an addiction to  <br>00:31:44.760 social media pornography food whatever  <br>00:31:47.880 it might be um Can Implement to try and  <br>00:31:50.960 shift that cycle that they might be  <br>00:31:53.159 going through especially when they're  <br>00:31:54.519 halting hungry angry lonely or tired how  <br>00:31:57.399 often have you worked with addicts have  <br>00:31:59.320 you spent much time working with addicts  <br>00:32:00.840 directly oh my gosh yeah so that's the  <br>00:32:02.720 bulk of my career is working uh with  <br>00:32:05.679 people with all different kinds of  <br>00:32:07.000 addictions me an example of the most  <br>00:32:09.039 obscure the most I had a patient who was  <br>00:32:11.840 addicted to  <br>00:32:13.399 water I know hard hard to imagine you  <br>00:32:16.639 have to though understand her narrative  <br>00:32:19.480 so she had a very severe alcohol  <br>00:32:21.880 addiction she got into recovery from  <br>00:32:24.320 that addiction and gave up alcohol but  <br>00:32:26.919 she discovered that by drinking copious  <br>00:32:29.880 amounts of water she could become  <br>00:32:32.880 hyponic meaning that she could lower the  <br>00:32:36.360 sodium levels in her bloodstream which  <br>00:32:38.159 would then lead her to become delirious  <br>00:32:40.600 and so in her desire to just be checked  <br>00:32:42.720 out she would do that she would she  <br>00:32:45.080 would drink a large amounts of water  <br>00:32:48.240 she's doing okay no sadly she's not um  <br>00:32:51.600 she she ended up taking her own life so  <br>00:32:54.240 that was very sad  <br>00:32:59.720 gosh in that situation was there was  <br>00:33:02.760 there a root cause of that behavior  <br>00:33:04.440 pattern further Upstream some kind of  <br>00:33:06.639 trauma or experience that had set this  <br>00:33:09.120 sort of cascade cascading set of issues  <br>00:33:11.240 off yeah you know I'm just speaking  <br>00:33:14.039 broadly um for for some patients with  <br>00:33:17.120 severe addiction trauma is a huge Factor  <br>00:33:21.480 um especially severe Early Childhood  <br>00:33:24.000 trauma but there are also many folks we  <br>00:33:27.399 see  <br>00:33:28.399 who have kind of great parents and have  <br>00:33:31.159 had happy childhoods and have great  <br>00:33:34.159 social networks and and work that they  <br>00:33:36.720 enjoy and yet they still become addicted  <br>00:33:40.240 and that's because we again we are wired  <br>00:33:44.600 to consume as much as possible of  <br>00:33:47.880 whatever releases dopamine in our brains  <br>00:33:50.120 to have survived Evolution to this date  <br>00:33:53.519 and yet we're living in this world where  <br>00:33:55.320 we have access to so many drug aied  <br>00:33:58.519 substances and behaviors that we've all  <br>00:34:00.760 become vulnerable to this problem and  <br>00:34:02.960 the reason I highlight this is because  <br>00:34:05.360 one of the things that I think has  <br>00:34:06.760 happened in the field of addiction  <br>00:34:08.359 medicine that maybe isn't the best is  <br>00:34:12.320 that often times patients themselves as  <br>00:34:14.879 well as their providers are digging  <br>00:34:17.040 really deep to find the trauma or the  <br>00:34:20.639 reason that someone has become addicted  <br>00:34:23.760 and I think that that's important to do  <br>00:34:25.800 in some cases but in in other other  <br>00:34:28.079 cases it can lead to kind of  <br>00:34:30.239 manufacturing trauma where there really  <br>00:34:32.280 isn't any furthermore I would say that  <br>00:34:35.199 when a person is in the throws of their  <br>00:34:37.119 addiction they're not going to be able  <br>00:34:39.560 to really do the complex emotional  <br>00:34:42.199 processing of their trauma while they're  <br>00:34:44.520 still using their drug of choice that  <br>00:34:46.719 they really need to get out of that  <br>00:34:48.440 Vortex of addiction and get into some  <br>00:34:50.560 degree of recovery before you would even  <br>00:34:53.159 want to go tackle some of those early  <br>00:34:55.560 traumatic experiences how many people do  <br>00:34:58.240 you think are struggling with some form  <br>00:34:59.680 of  <br>00:35:00.640 addiction well if you think of addiction  <br>00:35:02.920 as a spectrum disorder right there's  <br>00:35:04.800 mild moderate and severe um and there's  <br>00:35:08.200 I would even say a kind of a pre-  <br>00:35:09.680 addiction state where we're all sort of  <br>00:35:11.359 dabbling in compulsive overc consumption  <br>00:35:14.079 I would say the vast majority of us like  <br>00:35:16.760 90 probably  <br>00:35:19.200 95% have some degree of compulsive over  <br>00:35:22.599 consumption and you know if and when it  <br>00:35:25.320 tips over into what we would call  <br>00:35:26.920 addiction there's not a brain scan or a  <br>00:35:29.160 blood test to assess that it's not like  <br>00:35:31.040 you know switching a light a light  <br>00:35:32.520 switch and it's like oh yeah now you  <br>00:35:33.680 have addiction um it's not like that  <br>00:35:36.200 it's you know it's a gradual often a  <br>00:35:37.920 gradual and Insidious thing and we don't  <br>00:35:40.280 in fact have a biological measurement of  <br>00:35:42.960 addiction we Bas it on what we call  <br>00:35:45.320 phenomenology which is patterns of  <br>00:35:47.200 behavior that re repeat themselves  <br>00:35:49.079 across time and broadly speaking the  <br>00:35:52.319 definition of addiction is the continued  <br>00:35:54.440 compulsive use of a substance or a  <br>00:35:57.079 behavior despite harm to self and or  <br>00:36:00.280 others and so you know that harm can be  <br>00:36:03.800 very subtle um or not right and it can  <br>00:36:07.560 be a judgment call interesting because  <br>00:36:10.839 we do throw the word Addiction around a  <br>00:36:12.400 lot in society but but really the most  <br>00:36:15.280 important part of that is to understand  <br>00:36:17.040 if it's harming yourself or someone else  <br>00:36:18.920 the behavior pattern yes that's right  <br>00:36:20.800 and to also recognize that we're not  <br>00:36:22.440 very good judges of that when we're  <br>00:36:24.160 chasing dopamine okay so we sometimes  <br>00:36:26.720 justify behaviors we have as being not  <br>00:36:29.119 harmful and it's fine and it's not  <br>00:36:30.480 impacting me at all and what do you mean  <br>00:36:32.240 exactly and we don't we're not very good  <br>00:36:34.079 at seeing true cause and effect honestly  <br>00:36:36.200 when it comes to these behaviors which  <br>00:36:38.240 is why often times people won't really  <br>00:36:40.319 see the harm until they've stopped using  <br>00:36:43.000 for a period of time in your book  <br>00:36:45.480 dopamine Nation you talk about an  <br>00:36:47.160 addiction that you had yes and it was  <br>00:36:49.160 really surprising to me because I would  <br>00:36:51.880 never have thought that being obsessed  <br>00:36:53.359 with erotic  <br>00:36:54.839 novels could be classified as an  <br>00:36:57.040 addiction  <br>00:36:59.839 what happened what was the behavior take  <br>00:37:01.440 me into that that phase of your life so  <br>00:37:04.400 I was in my early 40s um my kids were no  <br>00:37:08.200 longer little um I got a lot of my  <br>00:37:10.760 self-worth and identity from being a mom  <br>00:37:14.079 and my kids were sort of entering  <br>00:37:15.839 adolescence they were doing fine but  <br>00:37:18.160 they didn't need me as much um so I had  <br>00:37:20.880 kind of a grief reaction you know in  <br>00:37:22.560 response to that was trying to figure  <br>00:37:24.480 out you know how to navigate this next  <br>00:37:26.280 phase of my life I'd always been a  <br>00:37:28.640 reader and in particular a reader of  <br>00:37:30.640 novels um in my own way that was how as  <br>00:37:33.880 a child I self soothed was to escape  <br>00:37:36.240 into uh the Fantasy Life of novels um  <br>00:37:39.720 but I never had what what I would call a  <br>00:37:42.040 problem with it and then one day I heard  <br>00:37:44.880 another mother at school said that she  <br>00:37:46.640 was reading this great book it was  <br>00:37:48.160 called Twilight it was about these  <br>00:37:50.040 vampires and she was going on and on  <br>00:37:52.000 about it and I read it and I I can't  <br>00:37:53.960 tell you what it was but it was just  <br>00:37:55.400 like the the the key in my particular it  <br>00:37:57.880 was completely  <br>00:37:59.079 transporting it just released a lot of  <br>00:38:01.880 dope mean is all I can imagine in my  <br>00:38:03.720 brains reward pathway and so I read the  <br>00:38:06.119 whole series and then I read the series  <br>00:38:08.200 again and I read it again and of course  <br>00:38:10.440 by the third or fourth time it wasn't as  <br>00:38:13.000 you know reinforcing and I thought to  <br>00:38:14.839 myself I wonder if there are any more  <br>00:38:17.200 vampire romance novels and then for me  <br>00:38:20.240 the real Tipping Point was I got an  <br>00:38:22.079 e-reader I got a Kindle because what  <br>00:38:24.960 happened was I I even before I got the  <br>00:38:27.680 Kindle I started reading you know novels  <br>00:38:30.319 that I would say I would be slightly  <br>00:38:31.440 embarrassed to admit that I was reading  <br>00:38:33.640 like kind of bodice Ripper novels as  <br>00:38:36.280 time went on I I needed more and more  <br>00:38:39.319 like graphic kinds of descriptions in  <br>00:38:42.680 order to find it pleasurable and and by  <br>00:38:45.440 the way that's classic for the addiction  <br>00:38:48.880 narrative right where you start out with  <br>00:38:50.960 a little bit and it goes a long way and  <br>00:38:52.599 then over time you build up tolerance  <br>00:38:54.599 that's neuro adaptation the Gremlins  <br>00:38:57.560 pressing down on the pain side of  <br>00:38:58.720 balance now I need more of my drug in  <br>00:39:00.200 more potent forms to get the same effect  <br>00:39:02.760 gradually over time I started um reading  <br>00:39:06.280 you know more and more sort of graphic  <br>00:39:09.079 erotic sexualized versions of this novel  <br>00:39:12.560 and I would I was embarrassed so I would  <br>00:39:14.520 hide that I was reading them and that  <br>00:39:16.119 gets into the whole double life of  <br>00:39:17.640 addiction where now we're lying about  <br>00:39:19.720 our use we're we're using our drug over  <br>00:39:21.960 here but pretending like we're not so my  <br>00:39:24.319 kids or my husband would walk in the  <br>00:39:25.520 room and I would be you know hiding  <br>00:39:27.760 behind another book one book behind  <br>00:39:30.079 another book so it looked like I was  <br>00:39:32.319 reading something you know I don't know  <br>00:39:34.520 more  <br>00:39:36.720 sophisticated and then the Tipping Point  <br>00:39:38.800 for me came really when I got a Kindle  <br>00:39:40.920 or an e-reader and then my reading was  <br>00:39:43.560 totally Anonymous I could read these  <br>00:39:45.280 books anywhere any time no one knew what  <br>00:39:47.359 I was reading and as soon as I finished  <br>00:39:49.760 one um I could read another one and I  <br>00:39:53.359 almost overnight became a chain reader  <br>00:39:55.640 like literally when I was n doing  <br>00:39:58.160 something else that I had to do I was  <br>00:40:00.560 reading romance novels one after another  <br>00:40:03.160 after another um which meant I was you  <br>00:40:06.000 know less present for my kids less  <br>00:40:08.079 present for my husband I would often  <br>00:40:10.119 stay up till 2: 3 4 in the morning on a  <br>00:40:12.560 week night reading romance novels have  <br>00:40:15.040 to get up two hours later go to work  <br>00:40:17.400 exhausted not able to be present for my  <br>00:40:19.640 patience not enjoying my work gradually  <br>00:40:22.200 getting more depressed more irritable  <br>00:40:24.040 more anxious more insomnia we went on on  <br>00:40:27.520 a a family vacation with an family  <br>00:40:29.960 friends of ours everybody together at  <br>00:40:31.520 this beach house all the kids playing I  <br>00:40:33.599 was like hiding in a room reading  <br>00:40:35.000 romance novels so and this is exactly  <br>00:40:37.839 what happens with addiction is that our  <br>00:40:40.160 Focus Narrows and the things that we  <br>00:40:43.640 used to enjoy are no longer pleasurable  <br>00:40:45.920 only this one thing has salience for us  <br>00:40:48.720 we plan our whole whole day around  <br>00:40:50.599 getting it using it hiding our use um  <br>00:40:54.920 and that's what happened to me  <br>00:40:58.599 it's so interesting because I was as you  <br>00:41:00.280 were talking about that I was thinking  <br>00:41:01.319 about all the behaviors that I have that  <br>00:41:04.280 are maybe isolating me or you know I  <br>00:41:08.680 just even things like spending a lot of  <br>00:41:10.599 time on the internet just watching video  <br>00:41:12.720 after video after video on YouTube or um  <br>00:41:17.160 those kinds of things or just like  <br>00:41:18.680 spending tons of time in my WhatsApp  <br>00:41:20.520 group chat talking like roasting my  <br>00:41:22.960 friends about nothing right how do you  <br>00:41:24.760 know if like this is it's cuz on end of  <br>00:41:27.560 the spectrum I could say okay well  <br>00:41:28.680 that's harming my relationship with  <br>00:41:31.240 people in the real world but  <br>00:41:34.920 it's helping making me feel good and  <br>00:41:38.280 it's you know maybe helping me in  <br>00:41:40.480 another department because I'm learning  <br>00:41:42.200 more about vampires or you know like so  <br>00:41:46.319 like you know because there's there  <br>00:41:47.760 might be net harm somewhere else but  <br>00:41:50.680 then an upside over here which and then  <br>00:41:52.760 I start rationalizing this Behavior like  <br>00:41:55.280 how' you just distinguish between these  <br>00:41:57.599 behaviors and know what's bad and what's  <br>00:41:59.240 good you know what it's really hard um  <br>00:42:03.560 these digital devices are powerful tools  <br>00:42:07.079 but also very potent drugs there's no  <br>00:42:09.880 doubt that digital media lights up the  <br>00:42:13.160 same reward pathway as drugs and alcohol  <br>00:42:16.119 these devices and platforms were  <br>00:42:18.000 designed to be addictive that is to keep  <br>00:42:20.200 us scrolling and tapping long beyond  <br>00:42:23.800 what we plan for or what we want or even  <br>00:42:26.760 what's pleasurable I think we can all  <br>00:42:28.839 relate to using this  <br>00:42:31.599 medium to a point where we don't even  <br>00:42:35.000 like it anymore and yet have difficulty  <br>00:42:37.400 getting ourselves off of it that really  <br>00:42:39.599 speaks to the inherently reinforcing and  <br>00:42:43.680 cognitively adherent nature of this  <br>00:42:46.760 medium it is a drug and so you know if  <br>00:42:51.319 and when and how we're crossing into  <br>00:42:53.359 addictive  <br>00:42:54.400 use I think we need to be very Vig  <br>00:42:58.280 about whether that's happened in our  <br>00:43:00.319 lives and one of the ways to do that is  <br>00:43:03.079 actually to try cutting out that  <br>00:43:05.319 particular digital medium that website  <br>00:43:08.720 or that behavior for a period of time  <br>00:43:11.720 long enough to experience withdrawal  <br>00:43:14.960 potentially reset reward Pathways and  <br>00:43:17.200 then re-evaluate because when we're in  <br>00:43:19.640 the behavior as you yourself noted it's  <br>00:43:22.880 very easy to rationalize oh I need to do  <br>00:43:25.720 this for work oh I need need to do this  <br>00:43:27.520 to stay in touch with my friends oh I'm  <br>00:43:29.000 learning so much from this right and all  <br>00:43:32.520 of that may have been true initially but  <br>00:43:35.359 may not be that true anymore and what I  <br>00:43:39.119 often point to is the subtler signs of  <br>00:43:41.960 addiction which are things like  <br>00:43:43.400 depression anxiety in attention insomnia  <br>00:43:47.839 restlessness these can be early signals  <br>00:43:51.079 for our consumption entering into that  <br>00:43:54.200 addiction range but us not realizing it  <br>00:43:57.400 because again we don't see cause and  <br>00:44:00.520 effect which is why doing an experiment  <br>00:44:03.520 like I did with my romance novels you  <br>00:44:06.800 know following in the footsteps of my  <br>00:44:09.000 patients and taking the advice I give  <br>00:44:11.040 them and I gave my romance novels up for  <br>00:44:15.000 30 days right just to see like okay I  <br>00:44:18.520 think this is a problematic Behavior can  <br>00:44:20.359 I give it up how will I feel and the  <br>00:44:23.640 very first day that I the very first 24  <br>00:44:26.839 hours hours that I did not read any  <br>00:44:29.319 romance novel any novel at all I was  <br>00:44:32.599 astounded at my level of anxiety  <br>00:44:36.119 restlessness and utter insomnia I had  <br>00:44:39.839 completely unlearned the art of putting  <br>00:44:42.119 myself to sleep without this digital  <br>00:44:46.079 narrative and that lasted a good 10 to  <br>00:44:48.559 14 days completely mapping on with the  <br>00:44:50.960 amount of time it takes typically to get  <br>00:44:53.280 out of acute withdrawal that is to say  <br>00:44:55.559 for those neuro adapt PA Gremlins to hop  <br>00:44:57.960 off the pain side of the balance and for  <br>00:44:59.880 homeostasis to to begin to be re  <br>00:45:03.240 restored um but by the time I got to  <br>00:45:05.839 weeks three and four I felt not just  <br>00:45:09.000 better than I had in the first two weeks  <br>00:45:10.640 but actually better than I had felt in a  <br>00:45:12.480 really long time I enjoyed my kids more  <br>00:45:16.079 I was more present for them I enjoyed my  <br>00:45:18.760 husband more my work seemed salian again  <br>00:45:21.079 I had started to think oh maybe I should  <br>00:45:22.800 do something else you know maybe maybe I  <br>00:45:25.720 you know this work I've been doing it a  <br>00:45:26.800 long long time I don't it's not that  <br>00:45:28.359 interesting anymore all of a sudden it  <br>00:45:30.720 was interesting again right so you see  <br>00:45:33.440 the relativity of that honic pathway and  <br>00:45:36.760 how when we're doing that behavior or  <br>00:45:38.599 substance that's so reinforcing that  <br>00:45:40.559 everything else loses its salience we  <br>00:45:42.960 can really  <br>00:45:44.559 misidentify what is causing our  <br>00:45:47.680 irritability anxiety insomnia until we  <br>00:45:51.000 stop that substance for long enough to  <br>00:45:53.559 see its impact on our lives how is it  <br>00:45:55.800 making you feel because I think a lot of  <br>00:45:58.400 a lot of people can't understand how you  <br>00:45:59.880 could get addicted to a book I'm sure  <br>00:46:03.559 some people understand that but but for  <br>00:46:04.920 me it's not something I've ever become  <br>00:46:07.079 addicted to so how how did it feel was  <br>00:46:09.359 it like exciting is it arousing is it  <br>00:46:13.160 somewhere in  <br>00:46:14.319 between I mean I think that romance  <br>00:46:17.319 novels are essentially socially  <br>00:46:19.800 sanctioned pornography for women okay  <br>00:46:22.319 and the medium is narrative and if  <br>00:46:24.480 you're a person for whom narrative is a  <br>00:46:26.359 powerful drug as it is for me a story a  <br>00:46:28.960 narrative a fiction um very potent since  <br>00:46:32.000 I was a child then you know it was a  <br>00:46:35.119 natural that that that would be the  <br>00:46:37.160 thing that I would get addicted to and  <br>00:46:39.000 basically just like we've hacked and  <br>00:46:41.800 bioengineered everything to make it more  <br>00:46:44.240 potent I mean people there's a formula  <br>00:46:46.400 for writing romance novels like if you  <br>00:46:48.599 take a physical copy if you go to a  <br>00:46:50.400 store and you pick up a romance novel  <br>00:46:52.319 and you literally physically open it to  <br>00:46:54.520 2third of the way through you will get  <br>00:46:56.559 to the climactic scene pun intended  <br>00:46:59.559 right it's it's like it's  <br>00:47:01.480 engineered I mean I got to a point where  <br>00:47:05.000 I wouldn't even read it read after I  <br>00:47:06.800 wouldn't finish the book I would go on  <br>00:47:08.720 to the next book just to get to the  <br>00:47:10.400 climax part and then you'd move yeah and  <br>00:47:12.000 I wouldn't even read the danum ma or  <br>00:47:13.720 like what happens to the characters I  <br>00:47:15.480 didn't care you didn't care about no and  <br>00:47:17.839 also I didn't I got to point where I  <br>00:47:19.079 didn't care about the quality of the  <br>00:47:20.240 writing or the depth of the car it  <br>00:47:22.240 didn't matter it was it was the drug it  <br>00:47:24.440 was that moment I was looking for and  <br>00:47:26.640 you know there are a lot of free books  <br>00:47:28.400 on Amazon some some of which are high  <br>00:47:30.400 quality and some of which are not but  <br>00:47:32.119 like you know any good drug dealer knows  <br>00:47:33.800 free samples that's the way you hook  <br>00:47:35.599 people I would search for these free  <br>00:47:37.440 samples and that's part of it too like  <br>00:47:39.000 the searching for the drug so the  <br>00:47:40.920 Working The Upfront work you do for the  <br>00:47:43.160 drug is part of the drug right it's all  <br>00:47:46.680 that you know the machinations and the  <br>00:47:48.760 hiding and the this and the that that  <br>00:47:51.000 gets to be part of like all of the  <br>00:47:53.160 rituals surrounding it as you were  <br>00:47:55.200 talking as well I thought about work and  <br>00:47:57.000 work addiction yes because you earlier  <br>00:47:59.680 used the term excessive consumption and  <br>00:48:02.480 when I think about work even my work I  <br>00:48:04.200 Think Jesus I excessively consume work I  <br>00:48:08.040 start so many bloody businesses and  <br>00:48:10.400 invest in so many things and if you look  <br>00:48:12.440 to that behavior objectively if you're  <br>00:48:13.920 like an alien looking down at me you'd  <br>00:48:15.280 go this guy's got a [ __ ] problem do  <br>00:48:17.480 you know what I mean you think you think  <br>00:48:18.960 that's funny joking you  <br>00:48:24.480 know I feel for you and it's funny cuz  <br>00:48:27.640 in society we then those people are  <br>00:48:29.760 reinforced we clap that's right we clap  <br>00:48:32.559 we got this guy's not sleeping he's  <br>00:48:33.880 working 18 hours a day clap clap clap  <br>00:48:36.800 give him a trophy an award name a thing  <br>00:48:39.280 after him or her or right you know um  <br>00:48:42.960 and it's just really interesting that  <br>00:48:44.440 that that addiction of work and you tell  <br>00:48:46.880 me if it is it can be an addiction it's  <br>00:48:48.559 certainly in the scale of one end being  <br>00:48:50.240 sort of consumption excessive  <br>00:48:52.000 consumption in the other hand being  <br>00:48:53.079 addiction it's on there somewhere people  <br>00:48:55.520 can get addicted to work  <br>00:48:57.280 and part of the reason is that we've  <br>00:48:59.000 drug aied work right when when I say  <br>00:49:01.040 drug aied what do I mean we've made it  <br>00:49:02.720 more potent and this is true for all all  <br>00:49:04.760 these drugs we've made them more potent  <br>00:49:06.760 more novel more Bountiful meaning  <br>00:49:09.319 there's more of it and more accessible  <br>00:49:11.640 so if we if we break that down with work  <br>00:49:13.400 how is work more potent well certain  <br>00:49:16.359 types of work are more reinforcing not  <br>00:49:18.520 all types of work so for example Works  <br>00:49:21.880 work White Collar work is often now  <br>00:49:24.960 associated with stock options and  <br>00:49:27.079 bonuses right um there's often like a  <br>00:49:29.920 social media aspect to it or maybe even  <br>00:49:32.880 a Fame aspect or as you point out those  <br>00:49:35.280 are our cultural Heroes right so you get  <br>00:49:37.640 all this you know agulation for being a  <br>00:49:41.200 workaholic and that also because we're  <br>00:49:43.599 such social creatures right and human  <br>00:49:45.359 connection stimulates dope mean that  <br>00:49:47.480 that also makes work more of a potent  <br>00:49:50.760 drug personal brand right so you're  <br>00:49:52.760 LinkedIn oh my God this person got a  <br>00:49:54.880 promotion we all clap we the likes the  <br>00:49:57.200 comments you're amazing the agulation  <br>00:49:58.720 the a as you said the awards the  <br>00:50:00.720 trophies and then you've got um the fact  <br>00:50:04.040 the fact of novelty so once we've  <br>00:50:06.640 exposed our brains enough times to a  <br>00:50:09.520 certain drug as I said we develop  <br>00:50:11.079 tolerance right and then we need more  <br>00:50:13.760 potent forms or novel forms one of the  <br>00:50:15.960 ways we overcome tolerance is by taking  <br>00:50:18.799 our drug and then changing it slightly  <br>00:50:20.760 like adding a little new molecule on  <br>00:50:23.280 this chemical right or on the Internet  <br>00:50:25.920 you know when we're searching videos we  <br>00:50:27.720 want something similar to what we liked  <br>00:50:29.359 before but just a little bit different  <br>00:50:31.240 and that's what the algorithm does  <br>00:50:32.480 automatically right it offers oh you  <br>00:50:34.359 should check this out oh how about this  <br>00:50:35.799 oh check that out right and that engages  <br>00:50:37.680 our treasure seeking function we're  <br>00:50:39.319 looking for that that novel thing but  <br>00:50:41.480 that's not too novel right it has to be  <br>00:50:43.640 in our category of things we like and I  <br>00:50:45.520 think for work we have that too like  <br>00:50:47.160 there are so many ways now that people  <br>00:50:48.680 can engage in their work and it's not  <br>00:50:50.240 all bad that it's novel but you know  <br>00:50:52.640 certain types of work it makes it very  <br>00:50:54.480 enticing then you have quantity  <br>00:50:57.160 right I mean work never ends there's  <br>00:50:59.160 like no natural stopping point for work  <br>00:51:01.880 you know you do a line of cocaine you  <br>00:51:04.079 run out of money you run out of cocaine  <br>00:51:05.920 you're done right but that's not true  <br>00:51:08.720 for work everywhere anytime and then  <br>00:51:11.799 that gets to  <br>00:51:12.880 accessibility one of the biggest risk  <br>00:51:14.960 factors for addiction to any drug or  <br>00:51:16.880 behavior is simple access we know that  <br>00:51:19.559 if you grow up in a neighborhood where  <br>00:51:21.000 drugs are sold on a street corner you're  <br>00:51:22.960 more likely to try them more likely to  <br>00:51:24.680 get addicted if you live in a world  <br>00:51:27.119 where you have access to work  <br>00:51:29.839 24/7 you're more likely to expose your  <br>00:51:32.960 brain to more work and more likely to  <br>00:51:34.440 get addicted to work again especially if  <br>00:51:36.119 it's got all those other reinforcing  <br>00:51:38.680 qualities this is probably in part why  <br>00:51:41.079 people quit their  <br>00:51:42.720 jobs you mean if they just get  <br>00:51:44.599 overwhelmed or it's it's partially why  <br>00:51:46.440 people can never quit but I think it's  <br>00:51:48.359 important to make a distinction between  <br>00:51:49.960 work that's reinforcing in those ways  <br>00:51:52.640 and then work that's completely not  <br>00:51:55.160 reinforcing yeah  <br>00:51:57.280 alienating mind-numbing work in which  <br>00:52:00.720 the the actual task is separated from  <br>00:52:03.359 the meaning of a task I mean they quit  <br>00:52:05.559 their jobs either in search of more  <br>00:52:07.000 dopamine so if I'm working in a job  <br>00:52:09.319 where I don't know maybe it once gave me  <br>00:52:11.040 dopamine and now it's become monotonous  <br>00:52:13.240 and the same right I I need to quit to  <br>00:52:15.640 go find but there's novelty for you  <br>00:52:17.559 that's right yeah and that's true people  <br>00:52:19.799 many people change jobs every two to  <br>00:52:21.599 three years I I recently read that the  <br>00:52:24.000 the average life of a business now is  <br>00:52:26.200 like 15 years whereas you know 50 years  <br>00:52:29.559 ago it was 50 years and there's all this  <br>00:52:32.160 turnover all this churn chasing novelty  <br>00:52:35.200 also you know I I do want to emphasize  <br>00:52:36.920 that people who are in work that's not  <br>00:52:38.920 like intrinsically rewarding but is the  <br>00:52:41.599 opposite kind of soul sucking that's  <br>00:52:44.319 also a risk factor for addiction because  <br>00:52:46.200 people just wait till the end of the day  <br>00:52:47.680 till they can go home and then use a  <br>00:52:50.079 drug to numb themselves from the stress  <br>00:52:52.720 of work so it's it's plausible that  <br>00:52:55.119 people who are in lower pleasure jobs  <br>00:52:57.760 are more likely to be overweight or  <br>00:52:59.720 addicted or dependent on alcohol yeah or  <br>00:53:02.640 simply opt out of the workforce as many  <br>00:53:04.599 young men are doing now in the United  <br>00:53:06.280 States and what we know from data that's  <br>00:53:08.640 been collected is many of them are  <br>00:53:09.960 playing video games right they've just  <br>00:53:11.720 completely opted out of the workforce I  <br>00:53:14.119 guess this in part explains why there's  <br>00:53:15.839 a drinking culture that's associated  <br>00:53:18.400 with people who are potentially lower  <br>00:53:21.200 class um because they're doing um  <br>00:53:25.559 potentially  <br>00:53:27.480 less pleasurable work  <br>00:53:30.400 and they're therefore they if we think  <br>00:53:33.160 about the scale that they would then end  <br>00:53:35.160 up in the pub after work you know maybe  <br>00:53:38.040 that's partially true but even people  <br>00:53:40.280 doing like doctors and lawyers they're  <br>00:53:42.520 are oh okay yeah equal rates of  <br>00:53:44.799 alcoholism among those groups I think  <br>00:53:47.839 what's happening there though is that  <br>00:53:49.280 the nature of the work is just so  <br>00:53:51.359 stressful whether it's white collar or  <br>00:53:53.160 blue collar that there's this kind of  <br>00:53:55.000 work hard play hard right I'm going to  <br>00:53:56.799 work all day and at the end of the day  <br>00:53:58.119 I'm going to reward myself so now you've  <br>00:53:59.680 got a pleasure pain balance that's going  <br>00:54:01.119 pleasure pain pleasure pain and and  <br>00:54:02.559 remember the biological definition of  <br>00:54:04.960 stress is any deviation from  <br>00:54:08.079 neutrality so that every time our brain  <br>00:54:11.440 has to work to restore a level balance  <br>00:54:14.079 we're actually triggering our stress  <br>00:54:15.960 response triggering our own adrenaline  <br>00:54:18.559 it's stressful to have to restore the  <br>00:54:21.200 balance from those extremes of Pleasure  <br>00:54:23.359 and Pain I read in um your book you were  <br>00:54:25.640 talking about how different behaviors  <br>00:54:27.559 and sort of chemicals and substances  <br>00:54:29.240 have different impacts and I was on page  <br>00:54:31.520 50 of dopamin nation in a study of mice  <br>00:54:34.359 sex increases the release of dopamine by  <br>00:54:36.359 100% And amphetamines which is like  <br>00:54:39.359 drugs right hardcore drugs increases it  <br>00:54:42.079 by 1,000% by this accounting one hit of  <br>00:54:45.400 a meth pipe is equal to 10 orgasms yes  <br>00:54:48.680 it's interesting to think about that the  <br>00:54:50.760 different behaviors we have and how  <br>00:54:52.440 they'll have a bigger impact on our  <br>00:54:53.839 dopamine is there like any in an in in  <br>00:54:58.160 typical order of things that are like  <br>00:54:59.920 extremely dopamine inducing and things  <br>00:55:01.680 that aren't what's it like the top and  <br>00:55:03.799 bottom of the list but in your view you  <br>00:55:06.599 know I really think that it depends on  <br>00:55:09.680 the person and we've got to look at drug  <br>00:55:11.920 of choice right I mean potent drugs like  <br>00:55:15.799 methamphetamine like opioids like  <br>00:55:17.839 alcohol like nicotine like cannabis um  <br>00:55:21.400 are are going to be very reinforcing for  <br>00:55:25.000 many people but not for all people and  <br>00:55:28.000 most people do have their one drug that  <br>00:55:30.200 they sort of prefer above all others so  <br>00:55:33.880 although generally speaking intoxicants  <br>00:55:36.039 release a lot of dopamine in the reward  <br>00:55:37.920 pathway um I think every person is going  <br>00:55:40.799 to be different and also we we don't  <br>00:55:42.920 really have good ways of measuring  <br>00:55:44.839 absolute values of dopamine in human  <br>00:55:47.520 beings right we can do that in rats but  <br>00:55:50.039 we can't really do that in humans it's  <br>00:55:51.960 it's relative values I've got this um  <br>00:55:54.640 picture here which shows what looks like  <br>00:55:56.720 brain scans in uh normal person but then  <br>00:56:00.240 in someone who's addicted to different  <br>00:56:01.880 substances I'll put this on the screen  <br>00:56:03.119 and I'll link it below in the  <br>00:56:04.440 description for anyone that needs it and  <br>00:56:06.119 wants to see it but it effectively shows  <br>00:56:08.319 the impact that like cocaine has on the  <br>00:56:10.160 brain meth um alcohol and heroin what is  <br>00:56:13.920 what is going on here so the red in this  <br>00:56:16.640 image represents dopamine transmission  <br>00:56:19.720 okay so how much dope mean is being  <br>00:56:21.520 released from the pr synaptic neuron  <br>00:56:23.480 Crossing that synapse binding to  <br>00:56:25.520 receptors on the Sy aptic neuron how  <br>00:56:27.319 much dopamine is kind of swirling around  <br>00:56:29.520 in the reward pathway part of the brain  <br>00:56:32.599 and what this image shows is that on the  <br>00:56:35.640 left hand side in healthy control  <br>00:56:37.880 subjects who do not have addiction  <br>00:56:40.760 there's plenty of red right so there's  <br>00:56:43.160 plenty of dopamine Transmission in the  <br>00:56:45.559 reward pathway specifically here in the  <br>00:56:48.039 nucleus accumbens but if you look at the  <br>00:56:50.680 right hand column you'll see that in  <br>00:56:52.960 these individuals who have been using  <br>00:56:55.319 cocaine meth amphetamine alcohol and  <br>00:56:57.720 heroin in addictive ways there's almost  <br>00:57:01.039 no red which means there's decreased or  <br>00:57:05.480 below normal levels of dopamine  <br>00:57:08.799 transmission they are in a chronic  <br>00:57:11.760 dopamine deficit  <br>00:57:14.920 State this is evidence of the brain  <br>00:57:18.880 trying to  <br>00:57:20.880 compensate for too much dopamine being  <br>00:57:24.160 triggered by down regulating its own  <br>00:57:27.119 dopamine production and transmission not  <br>00:57:29.319 just to Baseline but below  <br>00:57:31.599 Baseline and importantly these  <br>00:57:34.400 individuals who are addicted to these  <br>00:57:36.440 substances these brain scans were done  <br>00:57:39.079 two weeks after they stopped  <br>00:57:41.599 using oh wow yeah which tells us that  <br>00:57:45.079 this dop dopamine deficit State persists  <br>00:57:48.520 for some period of Time how long well it  <br>00:57:51.960 depends on the person but we know at  <br>00:57:53.839 least from this experiment that the  <br>00:57:55.799 first two weeks are this persistent  <br>00:57:58.480 dopamine deficit state which is  <br>00:58:00.680 consistent with acute withdrawal right  <br>00:58:03.240 people feel when they first stop their  <br>00:58:05.039 drug of choice they feel terrible right  <br>00:58:07.880 they experience all of the symptoms of  <br>00:58:10.119 physical withdrawal that correspond with  <br>00:58:12.400 that particular drug they were using  <br>00:58:14.599 usually the opposite of what the drug  <br>00:58:16.160 did plus the universal symptoms of  <br>00:58:18.480 withdrawal from any addictive substance  <br>00:58:20.240 or behavior anxiety irritability  <br>00:58:22.960 insomnia depression and craving now if  <br>00:58:25.520 they can get through the first 10 to 14  <br>00:58:28.240 days what we see clinically is those  <br>00:58:31.799 acute withdrawal symptoms slowly start  <br>00:58:34.480 to get better and we think that that is  <br>00:58:37.319 mapping on to regenerating dopamine  <br>00:58:40.920 Transmission in the reward pathway and  <br>00:58:43.640 if they can make it to a month that's  <br>00:58:46.000 usually the point for for on average in  <br>00:58:48.920 based on clinical experience when people  <br>00:58:51.359 really can start to get out of that  <br>00:58:54.319 constant state of craving for their drug  <br>00:58:56.359 of choice and begin to see some light at  <br>00:58:58.680 the end of the tunnel for what their  <br>00:59:00.200 lives might look like if they can  <br>00:59:03.039 maintain abstinence from their drug and  <br>00:59:05.280 we can't just inject or drink dopamine I  <br>00:59:07.960 mean I guess that would be like drinking  <br>00:59:09.079 alcohol we can't just artificially mess  <br>00:59:11.640 with the the balances to try and restore  <br>00:59:13.240 the dopamine levels in an addict can we  <br>00:59:15.079 can't just add a little bit of dopamine  <br>00:59:16.640 yeah it's it's a great question because  <br>00:59:18.760 we have some natural experiments that  <br>00:59:21.119 suggest what what might happen if we do  <br>00:59:23.000 that so as I mentioned before people  <br>00:59:25.000 with Parkinson's have depletion of DOP  <br>00:59:27.280 mean in the substan [ __ ] That's What  <br>00:59:29.559 Causes That that motor disease the  <br>00:59:32.480 treatment for it is to give L Doopa  <br>00:59:36.240 which is a dopamine precursor if I were  <br>00:59:38.400 to give you a spoonful of dopamine it  <br>00:59:39.799 would do absolutely nothing because it  <br>00:59:41.000 doesn't cross into the bra the brain it  <br>00:59:42.880 doesn't cross the blood brain barrier  <br>00:59:44.520 but I could give you lopa which is a  <br>00:59:46.839 precursor chemical that would cross your  <br>00:59:48.960 blood brain barrier and get turned into  <br>00:59:51.520 dopamine and then diffusely bind  <br>00:59:54.079 dopamine receptors in your brain in the  <br>00:59:56.240 reward pathway but also in the movement  <br>00:59:58.880 Pathways when we give patients with  <br>01:00:02.119 Parkinson's dopamine in this form that  <br>01:00:06.319 can temporarily improve their movements  <br>01:00:08.880 but in about one in four Parkinson's  <br>01:00:11.400 patients they will develop a denovo  <br>01:00:14.559 addictive disorder shopping addiction  <br>01:00:17.359 sex addiction other types of addiction  <br>01:00:20.599 because we have the same problem we are  <br>01:00:23.760 stimulating  <br>01:00:26.119 the reward pathway with dopamine that is  <br>01:00:29.599 ingested exogenously from the  <br>01:00:32.680 outside and our brain reads that as oh  <br>01:00:35.559 boy got to compensate by downregulating  <br>01:00:38.559 dopamine transmission to below Baseline  <br>01:00:41.400 which then puts us in that addiction  <br>01:00:43.280 Vortex does that make sense it does so  <br>01:00:45.440 we have to I mean it tells me that we  <br>01:00:47.520 have to live lives in a certain sense of  <br>01:00:51.839 we have to live our lives in a certain  <br>01:00:53.160 sort of  <br>01:00:54.680 homeostasis and  <br>01:00:56.440 it's so easy not to in the world we live  <br>01:00:58.799 in it's like it's like impossible to  <br>01:01:00.559 live in a perfect homeostasis balance in  <br>01:01:04.359 the world we live in right even more  <br>01:01:07.640 than having to try to live within this  <br>01:01:09.839 sort of narrow range of homeostasis in  <br>01:01:12.400 the world we live in today we probably  <br>01:01:13.920 have to intentionally do things that are  <br>01:01:16.599 painful do things that are hard pleasure  <br>01:01:19.480 pain balance like we learn that when we  <br>01:01:21.839 press on the pleasure side of the  <br>01:01:23.920 balance like with alcohol or pornography  <br>01:01:26.880 or romance novels or cannabis or  <br>01:01:28.720 whatever it is right no sooner does that  <br>01:01:31.640 happen than our brain adapts by those  <br>01:01:35.160 neuro adaptation Gremlins hopping on the  <br>01:01:36.920 pain side of the balance to bring it  <br>01:01:38.319 level again but they like it on the  <br>01:01:39.680 balance so they don't get off right when  <br>01:01:41.400 it's level they stay on until we're  <br>01:01:43.079 tilted an equal an opposite amount to  <br>01:01:45.359 the side of pain that's the come down  <br>01:01:46.760 the hangover Etc but it turns out the  <br>01:01:49.520 opposite is also true if we  <br>01:01:51.039 intentionally press on the pain side of  <br>01:01:53.279 the balance for example with exercise or  <br>01:01:56.480 an ice cold water bath or intermittent  <br>01:01:58.760 fasting those Gremlins will hop on the  <br>01:02:01.119 pleasure side of the balance and we will  <br>01:02:03.119 get our dopamine indirectly by paying  <br>01:02:05.640 for it up front and there are studies in  <br>01:02:09.119 humans showing that when humans expose  <br>01:02:12.880 themselves to exercise for  <br>01:02:15.039 example dopamine levels gradually rise  <br>01:02:18.200 over the latter half of the exercise and  <br>01:02:20.440 then when the exercise stops dopamine  <br>01:02:22.920 levels will remain elevated for hours  <br>01:02:25.599 after afterwards before going back down  <br>01:02:28.200 to the Baseline level position without  <br>01:02:31.079 ever going into that dopamine deficit  <br>01:02:33.160 state so it's a great way to get our  <br>01:02:35.279 dopamine in directly because it's much  <br>01:02:37.880 less vulnerable to that compulsive  <br>01:02:41.200 craving phenomenon of overuse so you're  <br>01:02:43.400 not going to get an exercise come down  <br>01:02:46.599 you can butc and people can get addicted  <br>01:02:49.920 to exercise right but typically it's  <br>01:02:52.480 it's very unusual because The Upfront  <br>01:02:55.240 cost  <br>01:02:56.440 to to do the work and endure the pain of  <br>01:02:59.720 exercise in the first place mitigates  <br>01:03:02.880 our vulnerability to an exercise  <br>01:03:04.960 addiction and in general H okay CU it's  <br>01:03:06.960 so hard to do that it's going to be it's  <br>01:03:09.119 not like pulling a lever on a slot  <br>01:03:10.559 machine or clicking on a porn website is  <br>01:03:13.599 difficult yes okay so fighting for the  <br>01:03:16.480 dopamine  <br>01:03:18.599 is insulates us against the chance of an  <br>01:03:21.279 addiction having to really fight hard  <br>01:03:22.640 for it okay yeah and this kind of  <br>01:03:24.160 explains I guess in part why  <br>01:03:26.559 I pulled out some stats ahead of our  <br>01:03:28.400 conversation today that from 1996 to  <br>01:03:31.880 2008 participation in ultramarathons has  <br>01:03:35.400 increased by  <br>01:03:39.240 1,676 the ice bath Market is expected to  <br>01:03:42.440 rise from 350 million in 2024 to to  <br>01:03:45.640 nearly half a billion by 2030 the number  <br>01:03:49.279 of people taking part in obstacle course  <br>01:03:51.200 races like tough mut or hrock etc etc  <br>01:03:54.319 has increased by almost 7x from 2010 to  <br>01:03:58.119 2017 it seems like in society there's  <br>01:04:00.359 this counter movement towards people  <br>01:04:02.440 seeking out hard dopamine chasing pain  <br>01:04:06.039 yeah those are amazing I didn't know  <br>01:04:07.480 that those are amazing numbers um you  <br>01:04:10.000 know in general there's a part of me  <br>01:04:11.640 that wants to say well that's a good  <br>01:04:13.279 thing um but there there's another part  <br>01:04:15.839 of me that's wary also because we're so  <br>01:04:18.599 good at drug aying everything that we do  <br>01:04:21.319 that there's a way in which these types  <br>01:04:23.359 of behaviors can also be drug aied right  <br>01:04:26.160 made more potent with all of the  <br>01:04:28.400 technology the way that we count  <br>01:04:30.160 ourselves the leaderboards the social  <br>01:04:32.799 comparisons all of that takes this thing  <br>01:04:34.960 which is really in its natural state  <br>01:04:38.079 kind of impervious to addiction like you  <br>01:04:40.359 just typically wouldn't get addicted to  <br>01:04:42.520 these types of painful physical  <br>01:04:44.960 activities you would do what you needed  <br>01:04:46.920 to do for survival but we've managed to  <br>01:04:49.839 make them addictive in all these  <br>01:04:51.240 different ways I still think it's a  <br>01:04:53.799 better way to get your dopamine like I  <br>01:04:55.400 really encourage exercise we always talk  <br>01:04:57.799 about movement as medicine and in  <br>01:05:00.240 general our our life is so convenient so  <br>01:05:02.960 easy so passive so sedentary that I'm  <br>01:05:05.920 telling patients all the time you know  <br>01:05:07.799 get up off the couch move your body walk  <br>01:05:10.079 around the block I think that's the  <br>01:05:12.480 bigger obstacle right now is just  <br>01:05:14.319 getting people to move but I do think we  <br>01:05:16.920 need to be wary of not going too far in  <br>01:05:19.440 the direction of like the ultra Ultra  <br>01:05:21.799 Ultra whatever it is so what is a better  <br>01:05:23.880 way to live if we're trying to optimize  <br>01:05:25.760 happiness and to keep our dopamine in  <br>01:05:27.279 balance and not have the crashes Etc and  <br>01:05:29.400 come downs and hangover what is a  <br>01:05:31.839 optimal way to live our lives do we have  <br>01:05:33.279 to look back at our caveman ancestors  <br>01:05:36.000 and live like them I think that part of  <br>01:05:39.640 the problem is that we've  <br>01:05:41.680 organized Our Lives now around  <br>01:05:45.960 rewards almost everything that we do is  <br>01:05:49.160 predicated on the Feelgood moment we'll  <br>01:05:52.640 have at the end of it and because of  <br>01:05:55.480 that that we  <br>01:05:56.960 are missing out on the  <br>01:05:59.599 process we're projecting our psyche  <br>01:06:02.440 forward into the future toward the  <br>01:06:04.480 reward and not able to really be here in  <br>01:06:08.279 the moment okay this is going to be  <br>01:06:10.000 sound weird I'm going to give you a  <br>01:06:11.000 weird example so driving over here today  <br>01:06:13.440 I found I was nervous for this interview  <br>01:06:16.880 and in a way looking forward to it but  <br>01:06:19.279 in a way wanting it to be over right and  <br>01:06:22.760 and in seeing that in myself I thought  <br>01:06:24.640 that's so sad like that's that's so sad  <br>01:06:27.079 that we live our lives that way myself  <br>01:06:29.000 included always this weird blend of  <br>01:06:31.920 wanting whatever we're doing to be over  <br>01:06:34.119 so that in a way we can just go hide and  <br>01:06:35.760 do whatever that self- steem thing is  <br>01:06:37.880 that we do where we're safe and we're  <br>01:06:39.799 like you know stimulating ourselves in  <br>01:06:41.839 some way and then I thought well what if  <br>01:06:44.559 I knew that I was going to die right  <br>01:06:47.599 after this going come off really weird  <br>01:06:50.480 now but what if I knew that I was  <br>01:06:52.520 actually going to die right after our  <br>01:06:54.119 conversation today  <br>01:06:56.359 that totally changes my perspective  <br>01:06:58.119 doesn't it because this time you and I  <br>01:07:00.240 have that's all I got it's over for me  <br>01:07:02.559 when this so this this conversation is  <br>01:07:04.599 it I really better be right here right  <br>01:07:06.599 now and really taking joy in whatever  <br>01:07:10.760 you and I can find together and and I  <br>01:07:13.119 think the more we can do that the better  <br>01:07:17.079 what's happening there you're removing  <br>01:07:18.799 the thought of the outcome the rewards  <br>01:07:20.799 the potential you know failure or  <br>01:07:22.599 whatever and you're focusing on just  <br>01:07:24.359 being present and in doing so what is  <br>01:07:27.160 happening it's a great question and I've  <br>01:07:29.839 actually given this quite a lot of  <br>01:07:31.160 thought because I remember when I was in  <br>01:07:32.799 college and I you know met some like Zen  <br>01:07:36.599 people and they were like be here now be  <br>01:07:39.520 here now and I thought well whenever I'm  <br>01:07:42.880 here now I'm miserable like I I I don't  <br>01:07:45.880 like me and I don't like being in the  <br>01:07:48.200 world I I don't want to be here now I  <br>01:07:50.279 want to be somewhere else so I didn't  <br>01:07:53.520 really understand what they were getting  <br>01:07:55.200 at  <br>01:07:55.960 it really took me you know till I had  <br>01:07:58.279 lived quite a lot of life and had some  <br>01:08:00.319 you know some significant experiences  <br>01:08:02.760 and given it some thought that I  <br>01:08:04.200 realized oh be here now means be here  <br>01:08:07.599 now and be  <br>01:08:09.079 uncomfortable and be okay with being  <br>01:08:12.520 uncomfortable and being okay with not  <br>01:08:14.680 being able to  <br>01:08:16.520 control my pleasure or my pain or my  <br>01:08:19.479 comfort level but just being open to  <br>01:08:21.960 whatever comes and I think that's a  <br>01:08:24.198 really a key shift  <br>01:08:26.880 that I'm not trying to control my  <br>01:08:29.439 experience in the moment and that it's  <br>01:08:31.880 okay to be unhappy or Restless or  <br>01:08:35.679 uncomfortable and not trying to run away  <br>01:08:37.920 from that but just really turn and face  <br>01:08:39.719 it and embrace the discomfort which I  <br>01:08:42.640 also think is quite Universal I don't  <br>01:08:44.560 think I'm I'm alone in that and then the  <br>01:08:48.040 key piece about not not anticipating the  <br>01:08:50.679 reward is helps me be in the moment  <br>01:08:54.880 right because I'm not just waiting for  <br>01:08:56.640 the good thing to come after I'm saying  <br>01:08:58.719 to myself imagine there's nothing good  <br>01:09:00.319 coming after nothing at all right  <br>01:09:02.600 there's just there aren't rewards this  <br>01:09:04.359 is it and then also being able to say  <br>01:09:07.520 and it's okay if in the moment like it's  <br>01:09:10.600 not great like I I can Embrace that you  <br>01:09:13.520 know I can be unhappy or Restless or  <br>01:09:18.000 anxious or whatever it is and then when  <br>01:09:20.759 I do that you know I feel like there's a  <br>01:09:23.399 funny funny thing that happens and all  <br>01:09:25.158 the sudden I I'm not as anxious right  <br>01:09:28.759 and I am present and it there is some  <br>01:09:32.158 Joy there interesting so when you allow  <br>01:09:35.279 yourself to deal with being  <br>01:09:36.279 uncomfortable in the moment it turns out  <br>01:09:39.839 you it removes the thing that was making  <br>01:09:41.520 you uncomfortable in the moment which is  <br>01:09:43.040 like the avoidance or the worry or  <br>01:09:45.759 overthinking whatever else yeah I I  <br>01:09:48.000 think we have this and it's fed by  <br>01:09:49.839 modern culture this kind of expectancy  <br>01:09:52.198 that really we should be happy all the  <br>01:09:54.440 time and if you know if we've arranged  <br>01:09:56.800 things appropriately for our lives and  <br>01:09:59.120 if we've done our work and you know  <br>01:10:01.760 aimed true then we should just be like  <br>01:10:04.400 life is great and I don't believe that  <br>01:10:07.600 anymore I think that you know I mean  <br>01:10:10.960 like Buddha said life is suffering but I  <br>01:10:13.880 really think that  <br>01:10:16.000 fundamentally like it's uncomfortable to  <br>01:10:19.040 be  <br>01:10:20.080 alive and that it's a kind of a constant  <br>01:10:22.719 state of restlessness and discomfort if  <br>01:10:25.000 we're being really honest and and tuning  <br>01:10:27.120 in when I really let myself see that and  <br>01:10:30.080 feel that all of a sudden I'm I'm freed  <br>01:10:34.280 from from some of  <br>01:10:38.400 that what has caused your anxiety  <br>01:10:40.640 throughout your life in the moment you  <br>01:10:42.400 you referenced earlier that some things  <br>01:10:43.719 have happened that have led you to  <br>01:10:46.040 understand this better and understand  <br>01:10:47.760 yourself better what is what am I  <br>01:10:49.520 missing from this jsaw puzzle yeah well  <br>01:10:51.560 you're you're good you could have been a  <br>01:10:53.199 psychiatrist oh really yeah it's always  <br>01:10:55.640 time this doesn't work out there's still  <br>01:10:57.880 time right it's not too late you get a  <br>01:10:59.360 new profession yay um I think you know  <br>01:11:01.719 for me the the big Turning Point um was  <br>01:11:05.280 that we lost our we lost a child and um  <br>01:11:10.120 in the immediate aftermath of our  <br>01:11:12.000 child's death I was just determined to  <br>01:11:16.199 like sort of undo the experience  <br>01:11:19.560 and um you know get enough Psychotherapy  <br>01:11:24.960 and enough whatever whatever it took to  <br>01:11:28.679 sort of not feel that pain and it wasn't  <br>01:11:31.440 until I really just said oh like I'm  <br>01:11:33.560 going to feel this pain for the rest of  <br>01:11:35.159 my life it's never going away that  <br>01:11:36.880 suddenly I felt some relief from that  <br>01:11:38.920 pain and that was a real window for  <br>01:11:42.040 me so interesting that the  <br>01:11:46.800 it's  <br>01:11:49.080 acceptance yeah and and you know and and  <br>01:11:52.000 I think you know one of the reasons I  <br>01:11:53.760 love treating patients with addiction is  <br>01:11:56.400 because I really relate to that hitting  <br>01:11:59.159 bottom moment you know that moment when  <br>01:12:01.719 it's like you just have the feeling that  <br>01:12:05.159 like everything I try to do to manage  <br>01:12:08.760 this Behavior or to make my life better  <br>01:12:10.800 only makes it worse I felt like I had a  <br>01:12:13.440 very similar  <br>01:12:14.840 experience um and that it was only when  <br>01:12:17.800 I kind of realized oh I yeah I I can't  <br>01:12:22.199 run from this I cannot run this pain uh  <br>01:12:25.000 that I I begin to have some the  <br>01:12:27.520 beginnings of relief from that  <br>01:12:29.920 experience I can't outrun this  <br>01:12:32.920 pain it's all natural sort of  <br>01:12:35.600 disposition to try and outrun pain isn't  <br>01:12:37.199 it that's the irony right we're really  <br>01:12:39.600 wired to outrun the pain we are like we  <br>01:12:42.480 reflexively seek out pleasure and avoid  <br>01:12:44.600 pain and yet that's the very thing thing  <br>01:12:46.920 that doesn't get us to where we want to  <br>01:12:48.880 go but we do now live in a world where  <br>01:12:52.040 it's very easy to outrun the pain yes  <br>01:12:54.800 this is a lion that's chasing me this  <br>01:12:56.679 could be a bad email and then I open up  <br>01:12:58.880 a tab and start Doom scrolling or open  <br>01:13:01.440 up a tab and start watching video  <br>01:13:03.400 playing video games or pornography or  <br>01:13:05.440 whatever yeah that's exactly right there  <br>01:13:07.960 are so many ways that we can now  <br>01:13:09.639 distract ourselves from you know our own  <br>01:13:12.239 suffering or our own  <br>01:13:14.080 awareness and where do you find yourself  <br>01:13:16.040 now with dealing with that grief and the  <br>01:13:18.400 pain as we sit here yeah I mean I I feel  <br>01:13:22.080 like in many ways it's been a real gift  <br>01:13:24.159 in my life you know it's really informed  <br>01:13:26.480 my life in in ways that um I mean I I've  <br>01:13:31.480 learned things from that experience that  <br>01:13:33.560 I think it would have been almost  <br>01:13:35.199 impossible for me to learn otherwise you  <br>01:13:38.040 deal with a lot of people that are in a  <br>01:13:40.480 state of  <br>01:13:42.040 suffering  <br>01:13:44.840 I imagine that's a  <br>01:13:47.040 weight because I um even hearing the  <br>01:13:50.000 story of the lady that passed away after  <br>01:13:51.840 that water addiction it was like a it  <br>01:13:53.360 was like a weight on my shoulders just  <br>01:13:54.560 to hear it  <br>01:13:55.639 so if your profession puts you right at  <br>01:13:58.120 the heart of this type of suffering how  <br>01:14:00.560 do  <br>01:14:01.880 you manage that to to hold that  <br>01:14:05.880 weight a couple things um first of all a  <br>01:14:09.080 lot of people get better and when people  <br>01:14:11.800 with addiction get better  <br>01:14:14.040 it's so much better that it's incredibly  <br>01:14:17.760 rewarding to see and they're amazing  <br>01:14:19.960 people Absolut like the most tenacious  <br>01:14:22.920 talented people you'll ever meet and  <br>01:14:25.239 when they get better it impacts so many  <br>01:14:28.320 other people right their friends their  <br>01:14:30.360 family the people they work with so it's  <br>01:14:33.280 very rewarding work and and not at all  <br>01:14:35.920 burdensome of course you know for  <br>01:14:38.120 patients who don't don't get better or  <br>01:14:41.040 patients who die it's a terrible feeling  <br>01:14:44.679 and there is a sense of um  <br>01:14:47.120 responsibility and and guilt even when I  <br>01:14:49.679 feel like there was nothing that I could  <br>01:14:51.080 have done otherwise um you know I carry  <br>01:14:53.880 those losses with me so it's hard is  <br>01:14:56.400 there any particular cases that have  <br>01:14:58.320 stayed with you the most I mean every  <br>01:15:00.920 patient I've had who's died while under  <br>01:15:03.639 my care those are incredibly painful um  <br>01:15:07.440 and I will never you know those are sort  <br>01:15:10.040 of a those people will be with me as a  <br>01:15:14.159 part of me for all of my life young and  <br>01:15:17.000 old yeah young and old yeah it's  <br>01:15:19.120 especially tragic to you to lose young  <br>01:15:21.560 people and it always feels like their  <br>01:15:24.520 second gu ing like oh if only I had done  <br>01:15:26.960 that or if only we had intervened here  <br>01:15:29.199 but I just think that's the nature of  <br>01:15:31.120 death we we can't get away from the  <br>01:15:33.239 feelings of guilt around it no matter  <br>01:15:35.239 who we are and no matter the  <br>01:15:37.280 circumstances how young can addiction  <br>01:15:40.800 and the consequences of  <br>01:15:42.560 addiction ruin someone's life like how  <br>01:15:44.920 young can someone be when their life is  <br>01:15:46.320 ruined from from the work you've done  <br>01:15:47.639 and the the patients you've worked with  <br>01:15:49.880 and what are those addictions typically  <br>01:15:51.600 that seem to be most um susceptible to  <br>01:15:54.400 those that are young  <br>01:15:56.800 well I mean you know some some kids  <br>01:15:59.800 start with drugs and alcohol you know  <br>01:16:03.199 five six seven eight five six yeah I  <br>01:16:06.199 mean it's you know some some some kids  <br>01:16:08.280 use with their parents or their  <br>01:16:09.920 caregivers they're exposed very early if  <br>01:16:13.199 we seriously conceptualize digital media  <br>01:16:16.239 as a drug I mean then we've got you know  <br>01:16:18.639 even younger cohorts starting with that  <br>01:16:20.800 and we do know that kids can get  <br>01:16:23.679 addicted to digital media  <br>01:16:25.840 and as a result um die from that I mean  <br>01:16:29.000 there was just this tragic case of a  <br>01:16:31.560 young man who essentially got addicted  <br>01:16:34.239 to a chat box I think he was 14 not my  <br>01:16:37.000 patient it was written up um in the New  <br>01:16:39.199 York Times in the Wall Street Journal  <br>01:16:41.560 and he fell in love with this chat box  <br>01:16:43.280 started to isolate wasn't spending time  <br>01:16:45.199 with his family or friends and then  <br>01:16:47.560 eventually took his own life purportedly  <br>01:16:50.000 so he could join this imaginary person  <br>01:16:55.880 what's the youngest patient you've ever  <br>01:16:57.239 seen the youngest I've seen is probably  <br>01:16:59.960 around 15 14 15 and they had an  <br>01:17:02.880 addiction yeah usually cannabis alcohol  <br>01:17:06.239 nicotine can you get addicted to  <br>01:17:07.960 cannabis oh yeah oh my gosh cannabis is  <br>01:17:12.080 very addictive really oh yeah  <br>01:17:15.880 yeah harmful very harmful the target  <br>01:17:19.639 organ that it damages the most is the  <br>01:17:22.040 brain um it's harmful in many ways I  <br>01:17:25.120 mean it number one it demotivates people  <br>01:17:29.480 often and so they can have the feeling  <br>01:17:32.679 that they're getting stuff done or that  <br>01:17:34.480 they're creative when in fact they're  <br>01:17:35.840 not doing  <br>01:17:37.400 anything um it most people smoke it and  <br>01:17:41.040 so it can be damaging to the lungs and  <br>01:17:43.199 and other other organs um a lot of  <br>01:17:46.199 people say that well cannabis isn't  <br>01:17:47.840 addictive because I don't have this  <br>01:17:49.920 standard withdrawal phenomenon when I  <br>01:17:51.719 stop like I don't have the shakes or  <br>01:17:53.360 anything like that but keep in mind the  <br>01:17:55.520 universal symptoms of addiction are  <br>01:17:57.760 psychological symptoms anxiety  <br>01:17:59.600 irritability depression insomnia craving  <br>01:18:02.520 and people have that in Spades when they  <br>01:18:04.440 try to stop using cannabis plus we often  <br>01:18:07.000 see something called the hyperemesis  <br>01:18:09.280 syndrome so cannabis can help with  <br>01:18:12.120 nausea and vomiting it can help decrease  <br>01:18:14.760 the feeling of wanting to vomit but  <br>01:18:18.239 again as the brain continues to be  <br>01:18:20.800 exposed to it there's this process of  <br>01:18:22.880 neuro adaptation it stops working and it  <br>01:18:25.440 can even turn on them and do the  <br>01:18:27.239 opposite So eventually people can  <br>01:18:29.440 actually have a cyclical vomiting  <br>01:18:31.480 syndrome as a result of cannabis so  <br>01:18:34.560 they'll show up in the emergency room  <br>01:18:35.639 and say I can't stop I can't stop  <br>01:18:37.199 vomiting and the reason is because of  <br>01:18:39.520 the Cannabis that they maybe initially  <br>01:18:41.600 started uh to stop feelings of  <br>01:18:45.440 nausea on page 40 of dopamine Nation you  <br>01:18:48.880 say we've lost the ability to tolerate  <br>01:18:50.719 even minor forms of discomfort yeah and  <br>01:18:52.800 as I was reading through this section of  <br>01:18:54.040 your book I was thinking it sounds like  <br>01:18:56.440 we've gone a little bit soft in society  <br>01:18:59.760 um we've reset our pleasure pain  <br>01:19:02.560 threshold to the side of pain that even  <br>01:19:04.800 the slightest thing feels like trauma to  <br>01:19:06.679 us even things that objectively speaking  <br>01:19:08.679 a generation or two ago would not have  <br>01:19:10.679 been considered traumatic are now trauma  <br>01:19:13.120 we live in a bit of a trauma Society uh  <br>01:19:15.280 one that doesn't appear to be very  <br>01:19:16.520 resilient and the only measure of that  <br>01:19:17.920 that I have is if I think about the work  <br>01:19:19.440 that my grandfather had to do versus the  <br>01:19:21.719 work that you know people maybe in my  <br>01:19:23.88|## SUMMARY  <br>Dr. Anna Lembke discusses addiction, dopamine's role in pleasure and pain, and strategies for achieving balance.  <br>  <br>## IDEAS:  <br>- Dopamine is essential for survival, motivating us to seek out rewards and pleasures.  <br>- The brain's pleasure and pain centers are interconnected, influencing addiction behaviors and choices.  <br>- Modern technology can hijack our reward systems, leading to increased vulnerability to addiction.  <br>- People often misidentify their discomfort and rationalize addictive behaviors as beneficial or necessary.  <br>- Exercise can boost dopamine levels without the typical addictive consequences associated with drugs.  <br>- Addiction often manifests in seemingly innocuous behaviors, such as compulsive reading or excessive work.  <br>- A significant portion of society engages in compulsive overconsumption, often without recognizing it as a problem.  <br>- The relationship between pain and pleasure is complex, with both being relative to one another.  <br>- Early exposure to addictive substances can lead to lifelong challenges with addiction.  <br>- Individuals may struggle to recognize the harm of their behaviors while actively engaging in them.  <br>- Substances like cannabis can be addictive and harmful, often leading to psychological issues.  <br>- Withdrawal symptoms from addiction can manifest as anxiety, irritability, and insomnia.  <br>- The pursuit of pleasure often overshadows the necessary discomfort that fosters growth and resilience.  <br>- Being present with discomfort can ultimately lead to greater emotional regulation and fulfillment.  <br>- Addiction is not limited to substances; behaviors can also become addictive and damaging.  <br>- The rise of technology has created new forms of addiction, particularly among younger generations.  <br>  <br>## INSIGHTS:  <br>- Recognizing the interplay between pleasure and pain is crucial for understanding addiction dynamics.  <br>- Acknowledging discomfort can provide a pathway to greater emotional resilience and awareness.  <br>- We must actively seek out challenges that encourage growth rather than succumb to avoidance.  <br>- Many addictive behaviors arise from the need to escape discomfort or seek immediate gratification.  <br>- The modern world often promotes instant pleasures, which can lead to chronic dissatisfaction.  <br>- Self-awareness is vital for identifying harmful behaviors masquerading as harmless activities.  <br>- Finding balance in today's pleasure-rich environment requires intentional effort and mindfulness.  <br>- Awareness of personal triggers can help mitigate the risk of falling into addictive patterns.  <br>- Understanding that addiction can stem from various sources, not just trauma, broadens our perspective.  <br>- Acknowledging the societal pressures and norms around productivity can help combat work addiction.  <br>  <br>## QUOTES:  <br>- "Dopamine is fundamental to our survival."  <br>- "The same parts of the brain that process pleasure also process pain."  <br>- "We automatically seek out pleasure and avoid pain."  <br>- "Alcohol works through its own chemical pathway."  <br>- "We're all wired to be addicted."  <br>- "One hit of a meth pipe is equal to 10 orgasms."  <br>- "We've lost the ability to tolerate even minor forms of discomfort."  <br>- "Digital media lights up the same reward pathway as drugs and alcohol."  <br>- "People can get addicted to behaviors too."  <br>- "The brain adapts by down regulating dopamine transmission."  <br>- "Every time we do something pleasurable, dopamine affects our behavior."  <br>- "The balance wants to remain level."  <br>- "It’s okay to be unhappy or restless."  <br>- "Addiction is the continued compulsive use of a substance despite harm."  <br>- "If we continue to consume our drug of choice, we enter an addicted brain."  <br>- "Exercise can help restore homeostasis and positively affect dopamine levels."  <br>  <br>## HABITS:  <br>- Engage in physical activities like exercise to boost dopamine naturally and combat cravings.  <br>- Practice mindfulness to remain present, reducing the urge to escape discomfort.  <br>- Limit exposure to digital media to help reset your reward system and reduce addiction risk.  <br>- Set boundaries around work to prevent excessive consumption and burnout.  <br>- Implement a regular sleep schedule to maintain emotional regulation and mental clarity.  <br>- Explore hobbies that require effort and investment, promoting satisfaction over instant gratification.  <br>- Take periodic breaks from addictive behaviors to assess their impact on your well-being.  <br>- Engage in social activities that foster genuine connections, counteracting feelings of loneliness.  <br>- Maintain a balanced diet to support overall brain health and dopamine production.  <br>- Reflect on personal triggers and develop strategies to mitigate their impact on behaviors.  <br>  <br>## FACTS:  <br>- Dopamine release is significantly increased by addictive substances compared to natural rewards.  <br>- The average life of a business has decreased from 50 years to around 15 years.  <br>- Participation in ultramarathons increased by 1,676% between 1996 to 2008.  <br>- Cannabis can lead to psychological symptoms similar to those of other addictive substances.  <br>- The human brain can experience a dopamine deficit state even after stopping substance use.  <br>- Withdrawal from addictive substances can cause universal symptoms like anxiety and depression.  <br>- Digital media can be as addictive as traditional substances, affecting younger generations particularly.  <br>- Many people are unaware of their compulsive overconsumption behaviors and their consequences.  <br>- The relationship between pleasure and pain is fundamental to understanding addiction in modern life.  <br>- Addictive behaviors can stem from a variety of sources, not just childhood trauma.  <br>  <br>## REFERENCES:

pleasure, and pain is essential for overcoming addiction.  <br>  <br>## RECOMMENDATIONS:  <br>- Practice self-awareness to identify rationalizations for harmful behaviors and address them.  <br>- Engage in activities that require effort to foster genuine satisfaction and reduce reliance on instant gratification.  <br>- Develop a support network to help navigate challenges and reduce feelings of isolation.  <br>- Reflect regularly on your behaviors and their impact on your mental health and well-being.  <br>- Explore new hobbies or interests that challenge you and promote personal growth.  <br>- Limit time spent on social media to reduce compulsive scrolling and dopamine-seeking behaviors.  <br>- Seek professional help if struggling with addiction to gain tools and strategies for recovery.  <br>- Embrace discomfort as a natural part of life, allowing for greater emotional resilience.  <br>- Set realistic goals around reducing addictive behaviors and celebrate small victories along the way.  <br>- Prioritize sleep and regular exercise to support overall mental health and well-being.|**Description:** This video features Dr. Anna Lembke, a psychiatrist and addiction expert,
