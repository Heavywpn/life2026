[Music]00:00:14.519 hello and welcome back to learn Linux TV00:00:17.439 as you can probably tell if you're a00:00:19.279 subscriber of this channel already I'm00:00:21.119 not in my usual location actually I'm in00:00:24.439 Sydney Nova Scotia Canada and I'm here00:00:27.160 at 45 drives headquarters for their00:00:29.960 Creator Summit and I'm having a ton of00:00:31.840 fun in fact I'm one of several YouTubers00:00:34.840 that are here at this event and one of00:00:37.760 which is Brett he's known on YouTube as00:00:39.800 raid owl and he's been someone that I've00:00:42.360 talked to for quite some time now but I00:00:44.600 haven't had a chance to collaborate with00:00:46.239 him until now so what I'm going to do in00:00:48.640 today's video is play back an interview00:00:50.719 that I had with him where we discussed00:00:52.920 what's wrong with Linux but before we00:00:55.280 get to that though I need to make you00:00:56.879 aware that my merchandise shop the00:00:58.879 official merch shop for learn Linux TV00:01:00.800 has been recently updated with brand new00:01:03.000 products inside the shop you'll find00:01:05.040 drro themed shirts bags drink wear and00:01:07.400 more and there's some other surprises00:01:09.280 there as well for example I've just00:01:11.200 introduced a mouse pad that doubles as a00:01:12.920 t-mo cheat sheet how cool is that you00:01:15.520 could get yourself something really cool00:01:17.280 and support Linux learning at the same00:01:19.240 time so it's a win-win thank you so much00:01:21.799 for supporting learn Linux TV I really00:01:23.880 appreciate it now at this point what00:01:25.840 we're going to do is play back the00:01:27.720 interview that I had with Brett but I00:01:29.520 want you to be prepared to subscribe to00:01:32.320 his channel you're going to want to if00:01:34.000 you haven't already done so anyway let's00:01:36.119 check out the00:01:39.680 interview all right so I'm here with00:01:41.680 Brett from the YouTube channel raid owl00:01:44.079 how you doing I'm doing good and it's00:01:46.880 Brett not Brent I want to be clear on00:01:48.520 that it's Brett not Brent not Brad I've00:01:51.799 gotten quite a few ones but yeah Brett00:01:53.719 Brad seems kind of hard to get out of00:01:55.159 that I don't know how I can't excuse00:01:56.719 that it's it's I guess it's my accent00:01:59.320 something with with Southern Accents00:02:01.520 make it really hard for people to00:02:02.880 understand Brett like it's it's usually00:02:04.240 a 50/50 for people to get my name right00:02:06.240 which is impressive but so we're here at00:02:09.720 45 drives HQ in Nova Scotia Canada00:02:13.760 Sydney um and it's been several days00:02:17.400 like I'm losing track of time like I00:02:18.760 always do but we've had uh a number of00:02:21.280 discussions we're brought in for a very00:02:23.440 specific P purpose um what I was00:02:25.720 thinking we could do is kind of talk a00:02:27.760 little bit about your presentation00:02:30.400 um and then maybe some of the experience00:02:33.000 that we had here at 45 drives okay yeah00:02:36.319 so my presentation and and all 45 drives00:02:40.280 brought us creators in to discuss uh D00:02:44.959 microsof ification that was the theme of00:02:47.879 yeah they made sure to make sure you say00:02:49.959 that right yes it's basically about how00:02:51.840 do we get from Windows dominating00:02:54.840 everything to having a more open source00:02:59.680 uh Community I mean we have one but I00:03:02.200 mean like how do we get that in the end00:03:03.519 users hands how do we adjust from being00:03:05.280 so relying on Windows to right open00:03:07.959 source so we all did presentations and00:03:12.080 um mine was on my 30 days of Linux00:03:17.159 challenge in which I failed uh I have a00:03:20.040 video on it it was an attempt to use00:03:23.799 Linux only for 30 days now I'm a I'm a00:03:26.159 Mac person I use a Macbook for Mac OS00:03:29.879 obviously and my main workstation is00:03:32.239 Windows machine and I was like I will00:03:35.599 put Linux Mint on a Dell xps15 and I00:03:39.560 will use that for 30 days and I will00:03:41.760 document my experience um I am not a00:03:44.400 Linux expert you are a Linux expert um I00:03:48.720 ran into issues I failed if you watch00:03:50.959 the video it's in the title everything I00:03:52.920 I I failed at 22 days um for various00:03:56.560 reasons and I talked about that and we00:03:58.040 had a lively discussion about why may be00:04:01.319 um and yeah it was it was just a good00:04:03.599 discussion if you want me to go into00:04:04.920 like some of the specifics yeah I think00:04:06.480 we will I just wanted to say that um I00:04:09.000 don't think you failed because you don't00:04:11.519 fail when you try and I think failure is00:04:14.319 not even even trying in the first place00:04:16.680 because I see a lot of times where00:04:18.160 people will barely try you know they'll00:04:20.040 try a live CD for an hour right and00:04:23.040 that's it and then they're done um but00:04:25.240 that was a serious attempt and I feel00:04:27.160 like you never know what's at the end of00:04:28.800 that you could be oh this is the best00:04:30.520 thing ever I've switched everything or I00:04:32.240 got to switch back because it didn't00:04:33.720 work out but um my understanding from00:04:36.479 your presentation was very reasonable00:04:38.360 you you ran into some very valid00:04:40.080 problems that need to be you know kind00:04:41.960 of looked at I think yeah and it's and00:04:43.639 it's hard like from a a Linux novice now00:04:47.000 if you watch my channel like yeah I do00:04:49.440 uh home labbing stuff and I I am way00:04:52.600 more um comfortable with using Linux and00:04:56.960 the Enterprise level as a server00:04:59.199 obviously where it dominates the market00:05:01.120 but everyone knows the meme this is the00:05:03.240 year of the Linux desktop so that's a00:05:05.199 whole different ball game so yeah I went00:05:07.560 into it with that in mind and uh the00:05:11.039 biggest pain points I had were from uh00:05:15.240 hardware issues whether that be my insta00:05:18.280 360 webcam deciding to go in earthquake00:05:21.639 mode in the middle of a live stream wow00:05:24.400 um sounds like a feature but I don't I00:05:25.960 don't think it sounds useful it was cool00:05:28.120 but not what I wanted at the time but00:05:30.759 yeah I was on Tom Lawrence's stream and00:05:32.360 it just decided to do that and it's that00:05:35.880 was a frustrating thing and also because00:05:37.919 the insta 360 software to control that00:05:41.360 webcam doesn't exist in Linux it's just00:05:44.120 you can't get it um that was one issue00:05:47.600 that was kind of annoying another one00:05:49.240 was I was having issues with my00:05:51.720 Thunderbolt dock I would just sometimes00:05:54.600 decide that yeah we're not going to00:05:56.120 detect monitors and it's hard to narrow00:06:00.120 down what is specifically a Linux00:06:03.039 problem versus what is a Dell problem00:06:06.280 versus what is a combination of Linux00:06:08.680 with Dell with uh Thunderbolt with the00:06:11.120 specific dock type thing and I know in00:06:14.599 your presentation you you talked about00:06:16.560 testing hardware and that's probably00:06:18.120 something I should have uh looked at00:06:20.479 before doing this and I think that's a00:06:21.880 valid point because I think I was00:06:23.520 telling you I when I started this I00:06:26.039 wanted a laptop and I almost went with a00:06:28.000 system 76 one which is famously known00:06:31.280 for you run window or you run Linux on00:06:33.919 those I was like ah you know for the00:06:36.039 price I can get a used D00:06:38.560 xps15 um with you know better specs and00:06:42.240 so I got that and you know I read a00:06:43.639 couple of forum posts that it was it00:06:45.120 worked well with Linux and it was just00:06:47.360 so many issues and then the second one00:06:49.199 came down to software like I am heavily00:06:52.960 reliant on Photoshop and Lightroom00:06:56.160 Lightroom is one of the main ones that I00:06:57.639 won't budge on and and when I needed00:07:00.800 access to some of those pictures that00:07:03.400 were edited in Lightroom right I did not00:07:06.440 have them so these are just like a00:07:09.840 couple of things that just just kept00:07:12.240 eating at me until you know you got to00:07:15.680 get work done yeah and so you have to00:07:17.440 get stuff done and it just boiled over00:07:20.919 yeah I think so so one of my opinions00:07:23.840 and and less so with your presentation00:07:26.039 cuz I think for you it was like00:07:27.840 switching your workflow over and00:07:29.039 everything which is00:07:30.039 kind of how it goes but sometimes when00:07:33.280 you when people compare the situation00:07:34.879 with Linux and windows I don't always00:07:36.240 think it's quite the same comparison for00:07:38.240 example if you bought an HP laptop that00:07:41.280 runs windows then in their R&D lab they00:07:44.520 have made sure that each and every00:07:46.319 component works and I did Windows00:07:48.599 Administration for a long time uh one of00:07:50.639 the things I like to do back then was I00:07:52.800 would just wipe the manufacturer image00:07:54.560 from the drive cuz they'd have all this00:07:55.919 bloatware like you know inkjet ads or00:07:59.039 whatever it is that are on there so I00:08:00.720 just put put on the Microsoft image and00:08:03.879 when I do this I have like five or 1000:08:07.039 drivers to find but that wasn't that's00:08:09.319 not a problem because that's just the00:08:10.919 industry that okay fine I just install00:08:12.639 the drivers and it's good but when you00:08:14.919 have HP doing that they put the drivers00:08:17.680 on and they tested the audio card they00:08:20.400 tested the Wi-Fi card for Windows and00:08:24.159 one issue is when we come behind them00:08:27.440 and then we put Linux on it we become00:08:30.599 the R&D for Linux at that point because00:08:33.159 HP decided not to do that and sure they00:08:35.479 did have a Linux laptop recently that00:08:37.159 was a really good one but um I think00:08:40.719 sometimes the experiment can be00:08:42.320 different if you you know have a Windows00:08:46.360 laptop that's shipped with Windows and00:08:48.240 you have a laptop that's shipped with00:08:49.720 Linux now you're not guaranteed to have00:08:51.600 a perfect experience cuz if the00:08:53.080 manufacturer did a poor job you're still00:08:55.279 run into the same problem but it it's00:08:58.399 kind of like I feel like Linux is00:09:00.920 marketed as the everything OS too much00:09:03.360 where people say oh it runs on00:09:04.640 everything you should install it and00:09:06.120 they brag it up and I love it but I feel00:09:08.399 like they're bragging it too much and00:09:09.920 they're kind of setting people up for00:09:11.360 this expectation that may not align to00:09:13.440 reality yeah um one thing uh I I found00:09:18.360 out when doing this and I'd be curious00:09:21.560 to know how true you think this is is00:09:24.360 that I found when asking for help or00:09:27.440 trying to get general advice on some the00:09:29.560 issues I was having um whether they'd be00:09:33.200 like simple things like U mounting00:09:35.600 Network shares like I I just want to do00:09:37.600 that in the gooey like I can do in00:09:38.839 Windows and it's almost like overly00:09:41.480 complicated to do it and when I asked00:09:44.640 for that I was almost like made fun of00:09:46.920 because I wanted it in the goey and it00:09:48.880 was like the Linux I want to say the00:09:51.120 Linux Community cuz that's such a00:09:52.839 stereotype but certain users in the00:09:55.040 Linux Community almost fetishize making00:09:58.839 things different00:10:00.240 like they take pride in how difficult00:10:02.519 something is to do and if you want to00:10:03.920 make it easier it's almost like oh00:10:06.519 you're not built for Linux then buddy00:10:08.360 you better go back to to Windows do you00:10:11.680 see that I do there's so much toxicity00:10:15.160 in the Linux community and I don't want00:10:16.720 to make it out to be that every00:10:18.040 community that serves a Linux00:10:19.800 distribution is bad I don't want to say00:10:21.480 that at all but there are some out there00:10:23.360 I won't disparage them and name them but00:10:25.760 what I find is that you have helpful00:10:28.279 communities you have have toxic00:10:29.920 communities and for an example in my00:10:32.880 forums an rtfm response is a banable00:10:37.200 that's banable you are not allowed to00:10:38.880 say that on my forums because my mindset00:10:41.360 is either answer the person's question00:10:43.839 or don't right you know CU I get upset00:10:46.800 when someone gets you know rtfm like you00:10:48.959 didn't have to respond because number00:10:51.839 one you're going to trigger their00:10:53.920 opposition which is not going to get00:10:55.800 them to comply they are not going to00:10:57.680 search like you're telling them to00:10:59.320 they're not going to check the manual00:11:00.760 like you're telling them to you've00:11:02.519 pissed them off that's the only thing00:11:04.079 that you've you've done and we need to00:11:05.800 and I understand that it sometimes is so00:11:08.680 annoying to answer the same questions00:11:10.480 over and over and over again but that's00:11:12.279 what we have to do and we have to do it00:11:14.839 with a smile on her face and anything00:11:16.959 else is doing a disservice say like why00:11:19.000 are you on a forum then if you're not00:11:20.360 there to answer questions like it's yeah00:11:23.040 it's like it's like this and and the00:11:24.760 thing is if you want to help out in a00:11:26.160 community answering questions in the00:11:28.120 Forum is not the only thing you can do00:11:29.839 so if that's something that's rubbing00:11:31.040 you the wrong way maybe you feel like00:11:32.360 it's aggravating you or something and00:11:34.160 you might give a response like that you00:11:35.880 could maybe take a break from it and go00:11:37.480 help somewhere else behind closed doors00:11:39.519 maybe documentation if you're a coder00:11:41.320 maybe you could do that so I just don't00:11:43.480 get why people are are snarky like that00:11:46.519 when why are you there yeah and it's00:11:48.959 it's I I've seen it before and I've been00:11:50.839 on both sides and and I get it that's00:11:53.639 some questions are frustrating to answer00:11:56.000 over and over and some may seem you know00:11:58.720 really simple but from the other00:12:00.680 person's perspective you don't know how00:12:02.279 much courage it took them to walk into00:12:04.920 that forum and know that they are going00:12:06.399 to sound dumb asking a basic question00:12:09.519 right and I know some people some people00:12:11.120 are just annoying some people come in00:12:12.600 and refuse to get the help that they00:12:14.880 need and it's just at some point you00:12:16.920 know if you have to walk away and say00:12:18.720 sorry I can't help like that's fine like00:12:21.800 some people are just like that we get00:12:23.600 that but yeah saying read read the00:12:26.600 manual like that that's frust in and00:12:30.000 very discouraging and you only get one00:12:32.000 opportunity to make a first impression00:12:34.000 true so if someone's coming in here and00:12:35.440 trying Linux for the first time or00:12:36.760 you're distro for the first time and00:12:38.160 that's the response they get you think00:12:40.480 they're ever going to come back and no00:12:42.240 and and we are the marketing firm for00:12:44.519 Linux I need everyone to understand this00:12:46.480 like there's no one company yes there's00:12:48.880 big companies behind distributions but00:12:51.560 there's no Microsoft that owns00:12:54.040 everything and makes all the rules it's00:12:55.680 a community project we celebrate the00:12:58.560 fact that there's all this all these00:13:00.079 different um different you know00:13:01.600 distributions we celebrate the choice00:13:03.760 but then we flame people for using the00:13:06.920 choice like we say oh Linux is great00:13:08.839 because we have a bunch of distributions00:13:10.959 but then when they go to post a message00:13:12.360 why are you using that distribution00:13:13.800 you're stupid you should be using that00:13:15.040 distribution so at one point we're we're00:13:17.040 bragging about all the choice with Linux00:13:21.240 and when people exercise that choice00:13:23.440 then you know some people kind of don't00:13:25.120 don't seem to like that very much yeah00:13:26.959 and I one comment I got a lot on my00:13:28.880 video video00:13:30.560 was uh the Dr chose it doesn't matter00:13:33.120 what you chose the dro doesn't matter00:13:35.320 and I feel like to an extent that's kind00:13:37.639 of true but also not true it it's going00:13:41.360 to a point where the distribution won't00:13:42.959 matter at some point in the future we're00:13:44.920 not there yet it it's possible that the00:13:47.000 distribution doesn't matter for a00:13:48.360 particular person for example if their00:13:51.279 apps all just so happen to be within00:13:53.440 flathub they're good right they it00:13:55.920 doesn't matter what distribution they're00:13:57.199 on at that point they can install their00:13:58.720 favorite applications but if one of00:14:00.199 their favorite applications is not there00:14:02.560 then they have to go get it a different00:14:04.040 way so we have the Frameworks and we00:14:05.800 have flat pack we have wh and all these00:14:07.519 different things that are really going00:14:09.120 to make things better but they're not00:14:12.079 being developed fast enough and I'm not00:14:14.680 going to disparage the programmers here00:14:16.800 because I don't really think it's their00:14:18.040 fault what I feel like is you have00:14:19.759 system D Wayland flat pack snap insert00:14:23.839 name of thing here you know people are00:14:26.079 really passionate about developing this00:14:28.480 and they think that they're doing a00:14:29.639 great thing I think they're doing a00:14:30.800 great thing and then when they release00:14:32.440 it people are like I hate snaps I hate00:14:34.959 flat packs I hate system D I hate00:14:36.920 Wayland And that's think about it like00:14:38.759 this you get a a developer that's00:14:40.639 excited and their spirits and they're00:14:42.720 going to get discouraged so here we are00:14:44.480 expecting these Technologies to grow00:14:47.279 faster so it can get us there but what00:14:49.440 we're doing is we're just slamming the00:14:52.680 Developers for their decisions to a00:14:54.480 toxic level there I mean some have00:14:56.839 received death threats in the past I00:14:58.560 mean it gets to be a point where if I00:15:01.079 don't know if it were me and I was one00:15:02.959 of those developers I don't think I00:15:04.839 would write code as fast because I00:15:07.000 wouldn't be as excited to do it knowing00:15:09.079 that once I'm finished people are still00:15:11.440 going to be upset with me and I feel00:15:13.000 like that really slows things down a lot00:15:15.279 yeah it's that and it's also I think we00:15:17.279 discussed it in in one of our meetings00:15:19.440 um we might discussed it multiple times00:15:21.320 was um releasing things before they're00:15:24.880 ready because it goes back to you only00:15:27.000 get one first impression like right want00:15:29.160 this feature uh okay uh let's develop it00:15:32.519 crank it out there oh wait it doesn't00:15:34.639 actually work that well and now that00:15:37.240 feature is just known as being buggy and00:15:40.440 crap reputation is everything reputation00:15:42.959 especially when you have all these00:15:44.959 different dros in00:15:47.519 Windows you can get a bad reputation for00:15:49.920 a certain feature but it doesn't matter00:15:51.639 because you're still going to use00:15:52.560 Windows like that's that's what happens00:15:55.680 if you use Windows and you're used to it00:15:57.319 you're used to having these things00:15:58.560 happen but it doesn't matter cuz what00:16:00.000 else are you going to do in lenux if a00:16:03.480 drro that is promising that is making00:16:06.199 advances00:16:07.319 but they just for some reason or another00:16:09.920 whether that's self-inflicted or from00:16:11.600 some other means gets a negative00:16:13.639 reputation right people are just going00:16:15.600 to hop to a different one and that00:16:17.440 that's right I mean we look at a long00:16:19.639 time ago I mean I was a fan of KD for00:16:21.560 for a long time I still am even though00:16:23.160 it's not my daily driver I still like it00:16:24.480 a lot um but there was a point where I00:16:26.360 was using it full-time and I remember00:16:28.199 when KD for 4.0 came out it was00:16:30.839 extremely buggy you could barely keep it00:16:33.000 running um almost nothing worked well00:16:36.000 and then you know it's a 4.0 release00:16:38.399 it's considered stable and then the KD00:16:41.319 is like well you're not supposed to use00:16:42.759 it yet wait till like I forgot what00:16:44.600 version I'm like well you released it as00:16:47.160 stable so I'm I don't care if you're not00:16:49.240 feature complete but if you're crashing00:16:51.319 I have a problem and this is everyone's00:16:53.920 workflow now obviously I feel like KDE00:16:56.399 is great now I mean I'm sure they00:16:57.839 learned their lesson I have heard very00:16:59.319 many complaints lately but there's still00:17:01.399 people out there that might still feel00:17:03.279 that's the case there's people that00:17:04.520 think Ubuntu still has the Amazon icon00:17:08.520 and that that it's spying on them which00:17:10.280 wasn't true but they took that away a00:17:11.720 long time ago but people would swear00:17:13.679 it's still there it's like the once a00:17:15.720 software project in the Linux Community00:17:17.480 gets a bad reputation it's extremely00:17:20.000 hard for them to get rid of that and you00:17:22.359 see that with butter FS when they00:17:24.439 released 1.0 which was not feature00:17:27.160 complete now butter s probably won't00:17:30.000 have a single chance of taking over ZFS00:17:32.200 I think it's a great technology I'm not00:17:33.559 saying it's bad but but yeah it's it's00:17:35.960 wonderful but now that we called it 1.000:17:38.760 it's got this reputation of the ZFS file00:17:41.320 system that barely works when all they00:17:44.559 did was call it 1.0 and I feel like once00:17:47.200 that happened development of butter FS00:17:49.600 slows down and the only thing I could00:17:51.760 think of is that it discourages people00:17:53.480 to hear all that backlash so one example00:17:55.880 I have right now is not specifically a00:17:57.240 Linux drro but that conversation00:17:59.320 reminded me of um I don't know who00:18:02.159 watching is um familiar with uh ice ice00:18:06.799 whale the zema board zema blade um zma00:18:10.240 Cube those zema products um wow yeah I'm00:18:12.960 not but I want to be at some point00:18:14.799 they're uh they're little like um sbcs00:18:18.240 or x86 they make a Zemo board and a zema00:18:20.760 blade they're like these little x86 like00:18:22.960 a Raspberry Pi that can boot from a flat00:18:24.720 from a USB key basically yeah it's just00:18:26.600 a little x86 N1 100 board and now they00:18:29.640 have a00:18:30.760 um they have a zma cube and it's a big00:18:33.480 nest it's like your sonology or qap it's00:18:37.039 just a and they developed their own uh00:18:39.600 little operating system for it called00:18:41.200 zma OS and they've been developing it00:18:44.159 for over a year but they've never00:18:46.760 released it as a 1.0 and I'm in the00:18:50.640 middle of reviewing one right now and it00:18:54.679 has a lot of issues but it's also not00:18:57.480 right a 1.0 so can't sit here and say00:19:00.080 you know this is bad like I mean I can00:19:02.600 say I can point out all the flaws00:19:04.240 definitely point but I can't say like00:19:06.520 guys this isn't a released product when00:19:08.640 it's released then I can give my final00:19:11.440 judgment on it as a whole and I feel00:19:13.919 like if more dros did that or with their00:19:16.280 features at least like this is ready00:19:18.520 this is stable we marked it as stable if00:19:20.640 you want another feature look at our00:19:22.400 road map we are working on it but I feel00:19:25.200 like that's not the case I think we need00:19:27.240 to have more people from a drro agnostic00:19:31.720 perspective catalog the hardware and the00:19:34.559 compatibility to have a drro agnostic00:19:37.000 compatibility database I'm not saying00:19:39.080 that that doesn't exist already I'm00:19:40.679 pretty sure that it does but we need00:19:43.559 something that is you know paid00:19:46.159 attention to that's being developed that00:19:48.679 is you know moving forward if we just00:19:50.919 had the one place that people could00:19:52.240 check then you know maybe you'll type in00:19:54.679 your Nvidia card and it might say works00:19:56.640 with a vuntu 2404 doesn't work with00:19:59.120 20204 and then it has that but one issue00:20:03.000 is we have all these distributions00:20:04.520 developing separately and that's not00:20:05.880 really a problem because they should be00:20:07.200 able to do that the whole point is to00:20:08.320 have a distribution of your own but00:20:10.280 they're also solving problems00:20:12.480 independently that they could help other00:20:14.440 distribution solve things that you know00:20:16.880 if if you're going through an issue with00:20:18.360 your dock on your00:20:20.480 distribution um if your distribution00:20:22.440 fixes it maybe they'll let another00:20:23.840 distribution know what they had to do to00:20:25.200 get that done and then the next thing00:20:26.480 you know if they Upstream it if it's a00:20:27.919 Linux kernel ISS you then it goes there00:20:29.400 everyone benefits but who's doing this00:20:32.960 you know like like we need we need00:20:34.440 someone like obviously we're expecting00:20:36.159 users to do it but they're not doing it00:20:38.039 yeah I think it's like a double-edged00:20:39.559 sword with Linux being so customizable00:20:43.320 and the fact that there's so many to00:20:44.440 choose from that's a good thing but on00:20:46.960 the other side you're splitting your00:20:50.840 developers and your talent into all00:20:54.600 these different pieces when imagine if00:20:56.679 you I know this isn't going to happen00:20:58.240 cuz it's not the nature of Linux or or00:21:01.159 open source but imagine if you just took00:21:02.799 those people and had a standardize one00:21:04.159 drro we're going to work together on00:21:05.919 just this one and we're going to make00:21:07.480 Linux yeah good for this one drro in a00:21:12.039 perfect world yeah that'd be great but00:21:14.039 that's not going to happen because the00:21:16.440 the reason people get into Linux is00:21:17.919 because they don't want to be forced00:21:19.279 into right a bucket they want that that00:21:22.159 freedom and and that was a big part of00:21:24.360 the you know the conversation here at 4500:21:26.520 drives we we talk about things like even00:21:28.919 during one of the meetings um PowerPoint00:21:31.840 froze for someone multiple times they00:21:35.039 we've had a update didn't we have an00:21:36.799 update window come up I could have sworn00:21:38.120 we did we had some kind of message come00:21:39.400 up a few different times and it was00:21:41.840 funny we were talking about how Windows00:21:45.120 is disruptive often to the users while00:21:48.159 it was actually showing disruption00:21:50.080 toward us while we were talking but00:21:52.919 that's kind of the main point that we00:21:54.240 get to when we say d Microsoft and00:21:56.480 personally my opinion is everyone should00:21:58.799 use the operating system that that works00:22:00.760 for them I want a future where someone00:22:04.360 goes to Best Buy and they see a Windows00:22:07.080 laptop they see a Macbook and they see a00:22:09.679 Linux laptop I want them to have a hard00:22:12.120 choice I want them to be there for a00:22:13.679 while and really have a hard decision00:22:15.720 because all three are just that good but00:22:18.320 the reality is um sometimes it's just00:22:22.000 hard to push something forward when00:22:25.240 other distrib all the distributions are00:22:27.080 each going their own Direction I feel00:22:28.600 that makes it tougher a lot yeah and00:22:30.640 it's I think we discussed this that was00:22:34.679 like we're it I think we were kind of00:22:37.240 split on this one where um feeling about00:22:41.080 the end user how much are they actually00:22:43.799 tied to Windows and we were like I don't00:22:46.320 think the end user really cares too much00:22:48.760 about the operating system as long as00:22:50.200 they're guaranteed that it'll work and00:22:52.520 and Linux hasn't proven that it'll just00:22:55.279 work because the connotation behind it00:22:57.720 is that it's weird because it's it's00:23:00.400 both it'll work on everything which I00:23:02.559 know isn't true but it has that kind of00:23:04.720 people say that people say that but and00:23:07.880 it doesn't work so it's got both this00:23:10.279 it'll work on everything but it doesn't00:23:12.240 work and it's it's so confusing that the00:23:15.200 average person they're never going to00:23:17.640 they're never going to use that over Mac00:23:20.320 or Windows if if that is the perception00:23:23.679 so and it wasn't a very popular opinion00:23:26.960 but I still stand by it that people00:23:29.000 don't like change you know if someone00:23:31.760 switches to Linux or even for just a00:23:34.279 little while because you maybe because00:23:35.760 you recommended it there's a very good00:23:38.159 chance that they're doing it because00:23:39.240 they love you they're doing it because00:23:40.559 they're supporting you they're they're00:23:42.200 helping you they're being a team player00:23:44.320 but changing an operating system is just00:23:47.480 not a mindset anyone has when they go to00:23:50.159 an appliance store they buy a fridge00:23:51.919 they don't care what's inside the fridge00:23:55.080 they just want their soda to be cold00:23:56.760 that's all they care about right so00:23:59.120 imagine if we go up to somebody and say00:24:01.120 Hey I want to change the operating00:24:02.480 system on your fridge it's going to cool00:24:04.039 your food better what um and I know00:24:06.440 that's a stupid example but if you think00:24:08.120 about it when you have a person they buy00:24:10.400 a computer it's an appliance they think00:24:12.279 of it like they're buying a stove a00:24:14.480 refrigerator a dishwasher they're buying00:24:16.360 a thing that does a thing and and that's00:24:18.960 all it is to them we come in change the00:24:21.320 operating system many of these people00:24:22.799 didn't even know that was something that00:24:24.000 you could do in the first place and00:24:26.520 they're going to feel anxiety when you00:24:28.440 recommend this because what you're00:24:29.960 telling them is I would love for an00:24:32.440 opportunity you know an opportunity to00:24:34.440 change the way you do everything00:24:35.919 wouldn't that be so cool yeah and then00:24:38.480 and then they don't want to get on board00:24:39.720 with it but um my opinion on Linux is00:24:43.240 that Linux on the desktop will only take00:24:45.919 off when a flagship desktop not marketed00:24:49.880 as a Linux desktop but does have Linux00:24:52.559 installed takes off then that would be00:24:55.720 something that could happen but it's00:24:57.799 just I mean look at Chrome OS like right00:25:00.880 Linux bace it doesn't say Android yeah00:25:03.600 yeah it's not Linux Android it's not00:25:06.039 Linux Chrome OS but it is popular people00:25:10.240 like it I wonder how how many people you00:25:12.279 think actually know that when they're00:25:14.000 using their Chromebook or their Android00:25:15.880 that it's based on Linux what percentage00:25:17.880 of people I mean I leg don't know I mean00:25:20.640 I really don't know but I I can't00:25:22.399 imagine that many people know or even00:25:24.039 care to know yeah so imagine yeah like00:25:25.840 you said if there's this third operating00:25:27.480 system that comes out out that looks as00:25:30.480 good as Mac OS and it has the00:25:32.600 compatibility of things with00:25:34.919 Windows people would be like okay I mean00:25:37.960 not overnight well I disagree I mean I I00:25:40.640 see your point but I feel like people00:25:43.039 will never switch to Windows I mean to00:25:45.320 Linux because they they're people are00:25:47.880 that averse to change it's really hard00:25:49.240 for us to understand this because we get00:25:51.880 excited when new technology comes out00:25:53.559 because there's new features there new00:25:54.919 technologies and things to learn but00:25:56.840 they don't get excited about those00:25:58.080 things things and I just feel like we're00:26:01.039 pitching something to a market see apple00:26:04.480 ships everything as you know I hate to00:26:06.120 use them as as an example but they00:26:08.279 they're very good at selling things00:26:10.080 they're extremely good at this and in00:26:11.840 marketing um how many times have you00:26:13.919 seen them Market oh check out our new00:26:16.039 version of00:26:17.399 BSD so many times right it's every00:26:20.200 commercial oh BSD o right no it's Mac OS00:26:23.480 they're selling a Mac computer with Mac00:26:26.559 OS and it it does well because they're00:26:29.360 selling a product meanwhile I feel like00:26:32.080 we're trying to sell an idea to people00:26:34.679 we should be selling a product yeah and00:26:36.679 I think it it's going to boil down to00:26:38.679 and this is getting further in yeah into00:26:40.960 the discussion but like you're used to00:26:44.720 like I said you're not you don't want to00:26:45.720 change so you're going to use what00:26:46.840 you're used to so how do we get the00:26:48.880 younger generation more used to using00:26:51.919 Linux if that's what we want to succeed00:26:54.840 moving forward if that's how we want00:26:56.600 Linux to gain more users but I feel like00:26:59.960 what's popular these days is you know00:27:03.279 this what you have in your pocket this00:27:04.760 is what people use as their main device00:27:08.600 so Y which I don't know is if that hurts00:27:11.880 or helps because I feel like when I was00:27:14.760 growing up we didn't have this if you00:27:17.360 wanted technology you got on the00:27:18.799 computer or went to the library cuz you00:27:20.799 couldn't afford it yeah and now it's00:27:22.640 like there's this distinct separation00:27:24.919 between my computer and my phone I may00:27:27.679 do more stuff on my phone but when I00:27:29.000 want to do something I get on the00:27:30.480 computer and now it's like well you know00:27:32.760 this is my phone and that's my computer00:27:34.399 if that's a Linux one then sure but I do00:27:36.840 most of my stuff here so I think one00:27:40.320 it's going to be a weird Next Generation00:27:43.679 10 20 years that's for sure I I can00:27:46.880 Envision someday the desktop completely00:27:49.799 dying and laptops being the only thing00:27:51.799 now now when I say this I want to be00:27:53.039 clear I do not see gaming PCs dying okay00:27:55.919 when I'm talking about desktops dying I00:27:57.640 mean for the people that don't game like00:27:59.279 the people that you know are are working00:28:00.880 in an office or you know their computers00:28:03.240 in Appliance they don't care people will00:28:04.559 still be building computers and buying00:28:05.919 video cards but I I do feel like at a00:28:07.720 certain point other than that the00:28:10.480 desktop is going to die and then as the00:28:12.760 portable devices which run Linux easier00:28:15.320 There's an opportunity there for Linux00:28:17.120 to come up with another device the00:28:18.679 desktop has already been one for so long00:28:20.559 it's really hard to to go back00:28:22.440 retroactively and win it this time but00:28:24.120 if you know we saw with netbooks Linux00:28:26.120 was there at the beginning and at that00:28:27.720 point a lot of people don't realize this00:28:29.320 a lot of people had a Linux laptop what00:28:32.559 happened tablets tablets came out00:28:35.640 everyone thought netbooks were going to00:28:36.919 be the thing it looked like Linux was00:28:38.880 actually taking off and next thing you00:28:40.840 know you know we have Android tablets00:28:42.720 that just we switched to that we00:28:44.240 switched to the the iPad and netbooks00:28:46.600 Fade Into Obscurity but what we saw was00:28:49.120 a new device form factor coming up Linux00:28:52.240 being there first and gaining from that00:28:54.640 popularity I think that's what we need00:28:56.559 this time yeah good example that we're00:28:58.240 seeing right now is the steam deck M00:29:01.039 valve gave the customers a feature and a00:29:06.080 reason to buy a product and the00:29:08.480 operating system was secondary you're00:29:10.519 buying this to game you don't care how00:29:14.880 it does it but it's running Linux so you00:29:18.919 know everyone's seen that spike in the00:29:21.320 amount of users using Linux just through00:29:23.480 Steam deck sales because of how popular00:29:25.440 it's gotten and I think if you can00:29:29.080 do that in a00:29:30.799 more I don't even know I don't want to00:29:32.600 say corporate world but more just like00:29:34.600 gener generic end user world like this00:29:37.960 thing it's super easy to watch YouTube00:29:40.480 and browse your mail and that's00:29:42.320 something I guess you see with Chrome OS00:29:43.960 I guess that's the appeal to it and they00:29:45.360 don't care what it is like you you give00:29:48.159 someone something they don't care that's00:29:49.399 Chrome OS they don't care that's Mac OS00:29:51.320 it it works so until L Linux00:29:55.240 distribution can get there right that00:29:58.640 is that easy for the average user on00:30:02.640 various different hardware and is00:30:04.960 compatible right with different00:30:07.600 hardware and I00:30:09.720 mean I I don't know I think he hit the00:30:12.840 na on the head and you know I feel like00:30:15.240 it's so Val valuable for me to hear00:30:16.919 about these things because you know I've00:30:19.279 been using Linux for 22 years right so I00:30:22.000 want to hear what people are going00:30:23.840 through today I know what people were00:30:26.679 going through when I first learned about00:30:28.559 it I know what people are going through00:30:30.320 as I read the news and study the00:30:31.640 communities and look at what people are00:30:33.480 saying but that's never the same as00:30:35.399 hearing it straight from someone's mouth00:30:37.000 what was their personal experience it's00:30:40.159 their personal workflow they decided to00:30:42.799 give this a shot and then they have00:30:44.559 something to say about it and that00:30:45.799 feedback is valuable yeah I mean a lot00:30:47.679 of people don't want to because a lot of00:30:49.320 the00:30:50.080 times if you Tred links and you failed00:30:53.159 you don't want to admit cuz you know you00:30:54.840 seem dumb like it's it's almost like oh00:30:57.000 I failed this thing I must have done00:30:58.200 something wrong I don't want to go share00:31:00.039 that with a bunch of people and some00:31:01.159 people do obviously there's people out00:31:02.600 there that are saying oh you know I had00:31:04.440 this issue you know why did I fail but a00:31:06.559 lot of people don't like they just like00:31:08.799 you said put in a live CD mess around00:31:11.799 with it it didn't work for me or00:31:13.440 something broke unplug it never try00:31:15.399 again never tell anybody like it just00:31:16.880 sucks if someone asks you oh did you00:31:19.000 ever try Linux yeah I tried it once it00:31:20.200 was terrible like that's but we also00:31:22.799 have to keep in mind too that sometimes00:31:25.240 the whole thing changes and is reversed00:31:27.559 when00:31:28.639 someone starts with a different00:31:30.399 operating system like like I knew00:31:32.200 somebody know somebody that started with00:31:35.200 Linux like you know when she's young she00:31:37.320 wants a computer whatever I have spare00:31:39.320 parts put it together put Linux on it um00:31:42.279 gave it to her seemed to like it a lot00:31:44.519 there was no problems because that's00:31:45.840 what she started with she never really00:31:47.200 had any issues she was not a computer00:31:48.919 person either like like she just learned00:31:50.720 how to do it and and that was that but00:31:53.159 she got frustrated one day when her00:31:55.480 friend asked her to help her uh put MP300:31:58.240 is and an MP3 player it wasn't an iPod00:32:00.000 it wasn't Zoom it wasn't anything crazy00:32:01.679 it's just one of those that's a flash00:32:03.120 drive and it works on every operating00:32:05.080 system so it did work on Linux and00:32:07.320 windows so her friend has Windows and00:32:09.679 and I'm trying to walk her through it00:32:10.679 I'm like okay here's what you do you00:32:11.720 click on the start button you go to my00:32:13.559 computer and when you're inside there00:32:15.200 you should see like some kind of icon00:32:16.760 that represents your um your music00:32:18.840 player and and that's exactly what it00:32:20.799 was but she gets irate and she's like00:32:23.360 why did I have to click three times to00:32:27.159 go to my MP3 player this design is00:32:29.600 stupid and then she starts like making00:32:32.320 fun of my computer like who thought00:32:34.120 that's like I don't know but that's just00:32:36.039 the way it is and that's just and I00:32:37.880 don't really have an opinion here but00:32:39.919 what the reason I remembered this so00:32:41.399 well is because what I saw was somebody00:32:44.480 who didn't start with Windows or Mac and00:32:46.519 I got a chance to see what their what00:32:48.840 their world is like it when that's the00:32:50.760 only thing they have experienced with00:32:53.000 and and you get to see what their issues00:32:54.880 are with Windows um and I'm not going to00:32:58.440 say that's a very standard thing but I00:33:01.039 do feel too that the operating system00:33:04.080 you start with colors your mindset of00:33:06.720 computing to a point where it's really00:33:08.120 hard to change that later yeah that's00:33:09.720 hard cuz how often do you get the00:33:11.039 opportunity to talk to somebody whose00:33:12.880 first operating system was Linux not00:33:15.279 very often wasn't so yeah not like many00:33:18.919 people's was but I will say I guess if I00:33:21.559 had to offer two pieces two the two most00:33:25.760 important things I think are barriers00:33:28.519 for a lot of people getting into Linux00:33:30.519 and this is both from personal00:33:31.600 experience and from talking to people in00:33:33.000 my community is one is Hardware00:33:37.200 compatibility and I don't know how you00:33:39.760 solve that if there's some uh00:33:42.519 centralized database that has all these00:33:45.120 different combinations or if there's00:33:46.760 some type of Hardware compatibility00:33:49.200 check that you can there are yeah there00:33:50.880 there are already it's just that you00:33:52.360 know there's at least a few of these but00:33:53.960 they last I checked they they they00:33:55.519 didn't have the information I was00:33:56.639 looking for I feel like you know we need00:33:59.399 something new that that that's you know00:34:01.960 with some excitement around it some00:34:03.679 people that really want to help this out00:34:05.440 they are willing to have someone you00:34:07.519 know send in hardware for them to play00:34:09.599 with and then report back you get enough00:34:11.839 volunteers all over the world that are00:34:14.040 willing to do this and not just say it00:34:17.000 works and that's it no we don't want00:34:19.040 that we want like some details if it's a00:34:21.239 GPU did you try multiple screens what00:34:23.760 refresh rate did you get what what00:34:25.760 monitor you know what what resolution00:34:27.839 did you get and was that the native00:34:29.480 resolution of your display I mean00:34:31.359 there's other kind of things that we00:34:32.760 really do need to know and we need a we00:34:35.679 need something that's going to provide00:34:38.560 that to users that's third party has no00:34:40.960 distribution interest and it's just00:34:43.879 there for that um and that's just one00:34:45.800 way but I feel like we will solve this I00:34:49.520 I also feel like part of the reason why00:34:50.918 it's so challenging right now is Linux00:34:52.719 is in a state of transition in many00:34:55.079 different ways simultaneously the system00:34:58.720 the display manager Universal apps are00:35:01.960 being introduced along with00:35:03.640 containerization and immutable00:35:05.400 distributions this is all being00:35:07.400 introduced right now okay it's going to00:35:10.920 be a little there's going to be some00:35:12.520 some dirt in the room and some dust you00:35:14.280 know I think for a little while yeah and00:35:16.160 the the second thing I think is um just00:35:18.760 package management like it's when I go00:35:21.680 into a drro I shouldn't have to worry00:35:24.560 about if it's using snap or flat pack or00:35:27.880 if I need to go find the Deb on their00:35:30.400 website or if I have to load in the00:35:32.320 specific repository and use app to get00:35:34.640 it like there's so many different I00:35:36.680 don't know if you standardize it or if00:35:38.359 you make a proper UI for a package00:35:41.839 manager that isn't terrible like it's00:35:44.880 just so frustrating because in Windows00:35:46.599 it's pretty standard and Mac is pretty00:35:48.480 standard you download the app you run it00:35:50.800 it's installed here it's like even in00:35:53.599 you even when you do have stores and you00:35:57.640 search for something and even in in00:35:59.720 repos it's like wait which version why00:36:01.880 do I have I want to install Plex Media00:36:04.440 Server to run on my Debian um desktop00:36:08.200 just to try it out whatever I I I type00:36:11.000 in Plex there's like four different00:36:12.400 versions I'm like that's a that's a00:36:14.640 legit problem absolutely and I'm so glad00:36:17.040 you mentioned that that's that's00:36:18.200 absolutely true that's I think those are00:36:19.760 the two big ones that if you can solve00:36:22.160 those that is the two biggest hurdles I00:36:26.280 think a lot of new people to Linux face00:36:29.079 including myself because those are the00:36:31.920 main things you interact with your00:36:33.160 hardware and your software and if either00:36:36.079 one of those you have issues with it00:36:39.200 you're going to give up and that's what00:36:40.640 happened to me so have you by chance00:36:43.000 tried app Images along the way or has00:36:44.839 that crossed your radar I I I have I00:36:48.280 think that when I was running00:36:50.119 aontu is it used in it's used it's00:36:53.200 another so it's another there's three00:36:54.880 primary Universal package formats that00:36:57.000 are buying pred dominance we have flat00:36:58.880 pack snap and app Images app Images00:37:01.880 being a distant third but what I the00:37:03.319 reason I bring them up is because you00:37:05.560 know my opinion is mixed about them but00:37:07.040 what I do like about them is it's like00:37:09.760 the app or excuse me the Mac App00:37:12.760 mentality on Linux you download like on00:37:15.000 Linux you or Mac you download a app00:37:17.400 right you double click on it you can run00:37:18.920 it you can put it in any folder you want00:37:20.319 it doesn't matter double click on it you00:37:21.440 run it so an app image you it's aapp00:37:24.000 image file you double click on it it00:37:25.680 runs it has everything it needs you put00:37:27.319 it in any folder you want and you just00:37:29.119 run it from that folder and then you00:37:30.440 could do you know for example you could00:37:32.359 have your syncing solution like sync00:37:34.680 things sync your you know apps folder00:37:36.920 with all your flat pack or app Images00:37:39.000 update one and then your you know Google00:37:41.359 drive or whatever it is will get all the00:37:42.920 others updated but I like that solution00:37:46.319 because you know it does give you the00:37:48.319 ability to just download something and00:37:50.040 run it you don't worry about it um the00:37:52.800 problem is not everything's available00:37:54.319 that way and then there's no like then00:37:57.119 you got to go in and update them all mhm00:37:59.160 and then you run into the Mac situation00:38:00.880 that Mac users run into where you have00:38:02.599 to download something like mac updater00:38:04.400 because you have um on Mac you have the00:38:06.440 App Store there's updates in there00:38:08.319 system settings you have your your Mac00:38:10.000 OS updates in there individual apps will00:38:12.680 update themselves or maybe they won't00:38:14.560 but you're supposed to go in and find00:38:15.720 out if they didn't or not some so in in00:38:19.000 Mac you have a lot of issues but they're00:38:21.040 not nearly as bad as the Linux issues00:38:23.440 but even with Mac it's really cool that00:38:25.599 you have aapp file you run it you're00:38:27.720 fine and with app Images which I'll have00:38:30.079 a video out shortly we'll explain how to00:38:32.400 use them but I bring that up because00:38:34.960 people are trying to come up with00:38:36.359 Solutions but you know we're going to00:38:38.319 have to decide in the community you know00:38:40.160 which way are we going yeah and that's00:38:41.599 the hard part and I think like everyone00:38:44.400 loves like repos like it's so great in00:38:47.760 Linux like oh you want a software app00:38:49.680 install this boom you're done it's funny00:38:52.800 I hate repos it's an nonp popular00:38:54.560 opinion because when I first started00:38:56.480 Linux I I'll never forget this it was00:38:58.640 like the very first version of auntu00:39:01.839 ever and I was using um open Office on00:39:04.680 that and then you know I'm liking it so00:39:07.119 I go online and I I find the news that a00:39:09.359 new version of open office has just come00:39:11.000 out and I'm like well that's really cool00:39:12.520 because I want to check that out I00:39:13.760 really like that so I ask in the00:39:16.160 communities how do I get that how can I00:39:18.040 install that like it's available now00:39:19.680 like just wait for the next version of a00:39:21.240 BTU I'm like wait a minute you're00:39:23.560 telling me I have to wait for the next00:39:25.760 version M of my entire operating system00:39:29.359 to have the courtesy of upgrading open00:39:31.960 Office when Mac and windows users are00:39:35.480 able to go to the website and download00:39:37.240 it and and you know Libre office00:39:39.480 nowadays I mean and even back then they00:39:41.200 might have had another repository but00:39:42.599 that's not even the point the point is00:39:44.760 you're being provided a package in the00:39:46.520 repositories that may or may not have a00:39:48.800 third party P repository that's so up to00:39:50.760 date but the issue you run into like00:39:53.599 like Linux users I don't think we can00:39:55.720 tell Mac or Windows users they have to00:39:57.880 wait for the next version of their00:39:59.079 operating system for the next version of00:40:00.720 their software the straight phas and00:40:03.280 that's why I've always hated that my00:40:04.720 mentality has been your Linux kernel00:40:07.800 display drivers critical operating00:40:11.200 system components can be apt packages00:40:13.599 they could be RPMs and distribution00:40:15.400 repos all day long but once you get to00:40:17.160 the user layer we need user space apps00:40:20.119 out of the package management completely00:40:23.200 we should not have Apache in the same00:40:26.760 reposit atory as our Linux kernel we00:40:29.000 should be able to install Apache00:40:32.000 separately via Universal package that is00:40:35.079 independent of the package system and00:40:37.640 this is why we run into problems where00:40:39.160 someone pip installs something and then00:40:40.839 it blows away their package database and00:40:43.280 and then they want to continue to say00:40:44.760 that repositories are great I'm sorry I00:40:46.960 know a lot of people in my audience are00:40:48.520 going to disagree with me on this00:40:50.480 software repositories are not good in00:40:52.720 the way that they're being run today in00:40:54.440 my opinion yeah and that's inside that00:40:56.680 you know as a novice I have no I like00:40:59.280 that that's not something that crosses00:41:01.200 my mind I'm the end user that when I am00:41:04.480 so used to app install of this and then00:41:07.920 it's it is confusing cuz you know as the00:41:11.280 new person comes in you're like wait00:41:12.839 everyone's telling me to use app install00:41:14.520 to get this but there's a a package00:41:17.200 there's a store shouldn't I use that to00:41:19.520 install it right it's like no like but00:41:22.119 wait yes but what do I do it's it's very00:41:24.520 confusing so usually what I tell people00:41:26.240 going forward for now at least to try to00:41:27.839 make sense of this craziness is when you00:41:29.880 go into your app store or whatever you00:41:32.640 want to call it and you want to download00:41:34.920 something sometimes or at least a lot of00:41:36.960 times there's a drop- down it'll say Deb00:41:38.920 version flat pack version RPM version00:41:41.319 flat pack version whatever the case may00:41:42.800 be what I'll tell people now until we00:41:45.000 figure this out is just download the00:41:48.400 distribution package for now unless you00:41:52.280 need the newer version now one trick one00:41:55.160 tip I give everyone about Linux is you00:41:57.319 should never ever ever ever consider00:41:59.920 using the distribution version of Libre00:42:02.560 office that should be the first thing00:42:04.520 you install you should never open it you00:42:06.359 should never consider opening it you00:42:07.880 need to delete it and then after you do00:42:09.680 that you could get Libre office as a00:42:11.800 flat pack that is fully up to date now00:42:13.839 why am I asking you to remove this now00:42:15.760 here's the problem Libre office gets00:42:17.560 stigma people will say it's not as good00:42:19.720 as Microsoft Office and the reason why00:42:21.559 they say this I think at least in part00:42:24.359 is they have a very old version in their00:42:27.599 distributions repository that they have00:42:30.119 installed and since then lib office has00:42:32.520 been you know as they do they look for00:42:35.520 ways to reverse engineer what Microsoft00:42:37.440 is doing they fix things as they're00:42:39.079 broken they keep updating it and you00:42:41.559 need to be using a newer version of libr00:42:43.720 office to benefit from the continual00:42:45.680 fixes that they put into this but now00:42:48.240 because distributions are shipping this00:42:51.400 and they're shipping old versions I mean00:42:52.880 what version do we have in in Debian00:42:54.400 stable right now probably two major00:42:56.200 versions old I'm just guessing but my00:42:57.880 point is they open this up they get a00:43:00.880 Microsoft Word file from a coworker for00:43:03.680 example they get formatting issues and00:43:05.960 it doesn't look right and tables are00:43:07.880 broken and everything looks a mess I get00:43:10.480 the same file in the lib office version00:43:12.400 that's newer and it's fine but you know00:43:15.119 sometimes I think distributions have to00:43:16.640 realize that they themselves are you00:43:19.200 know making things harder for people00:43:21.079 yeah it's totally true so I don't know00:43:23.960 if we solved any issues today but hope00:43:25.680 we did hope we that's what I saying like00:43:27.960 throughout this whole week is like00:43:29.720 you're not going to solve all these00:43:31.079 issues in a day but it definitely takes00:43:33.240 you got to start somewhere and you got00:43:34.400 to have the conversations CU if you00:43:36.240 don't it's just going to keep going how00:43:38.480 it is and we've seen how it's going and00:43:40.480 obviously with linux's 6% desktop share00:43:44.319 if we want that to increase you're going00:43:46.240 to have to have conversations people are00:43:47.680 going to have to make tough decisions00:43:49.160 that some people don't like but you get00:43:51.800 some somebody's got to start making some00:43:53.359 decisions well we are the again we are00:43:55.839 the marketing for Linux we are the00:43:58.240 marketing the Linux Community Linux00:44:00.319 users we're we and especially YouTubers00:44:03.160 like ourselves we are the marketing you00:44:05.559 will not at least not now see a Linux00:44:07.960 related commercial on TV I haven't seen00:44:10.119 one personally maybe in some other00:44:11.359 countries where you know sus is more00:44:12.960 popular for example maybe that happens I00:44:14.520 don't know but we are the marketing00:44:16.920 which is why I put so much work into00:44:18.200 special effects in this channel because00:44:20.040 I want to position Linux in the best00:44:21.800 light possible because we all need to do00:44:24.599 that because if if we just need to do00:44:27.359 the best we can and and sometimes that00:44:29.000 could mean someone sees a problem and00:44:31.119 they want to step up and come up with a00:44:33.559 solution I encourage anybody in the00:44:36.280 audience share some ideas if you think00:44:37.960 you know a solution to this or even if00:44:40.359 it's in the form of new software you00:44:41.880 want to develop or or something that you00:44:44.119 want to not develop because you're not a00:44:45.839 developer but draw out on paper for all00:44:48.240 I care um if you have an idea I think we00:44:51.079 need to get those ideas to the people00:44:53.160 that can make that happen if that person00:44:55.079 isn't you and you know you know to00:44:58.319 actually put feet on the ground on these00:45:00.960 problems and get this solved and I I00:45:02.760 hope people in my community anybody00:45:05.480 that's complaining about something a00:45:07.160 valid complaint that's not something's00:45:08.800 not working do you have the time to do00:45:11.000 something about it do you have the00:45:12.599 expertise to do something about it if00:45:14.160 you don't do you know somebody that does00:45:15.920 do you know somewhere where this00:45:17.680 conversation can get started and that's00:45:20.000 what we need to do and I feel like we00:45:22.440 can we can get there but the Linux00:45:24.520 Community will be who decides that yeah00:45:27.079 100% and maybe we're back next year and00:45:30.000 things are different I hope so it'd be00:45:31.880 fun it' be fun to do a sequel to this is00:45:34.680 it better yet yeah that would be00:45:36.599 entertaining but yeah this was awesome00:45:38.800 it's good to sit down you know a lot of00:45:40.920 people their first impression of of00:45:42.720 Linux is bad and they get discouraged00:45:44.520 because they go to the forums and get00:45:46.280 that feedback but it's good to you know00:45:47.920 sit down and have a conversation about00:45:49.720 what your issues are without you know00:45:51.920 and and and talk about actual Solutions00:45:53.720 instead of just a bunch of angry00:45:56.520 comments and people screaming things00:45:59.960 that just don't help anybody so yeah00:46:02.800 like Jay said in the comments like if00:46:04.559 you know anybody if you have the00:46:05.680 expertise to make things better I'm all00:46:07.599 here for it I know I I had a Linux video00:46:10.800 where I failed but I legitimately am00:46:14.079 still using Linux I have the the laptop00:46:16.680 I brought it with me here it's what I've00:46:18.040 been using I'm still using Linux he's00:46:19.920 still trying it like like he's try he's00:46:21.640 he's he has he's doing a presentation00:46:23.520 about it meanwhile he's actively still00:46:26.599 right now I saw him just trying some00:46:28.200 stuff on Linux Mint with with your GPU00:46:30.480 issue so we'll be back next year to see00:46:33.760 where we're at but yes was this was00:46:35.720 awesome00:46:39.960 thanks and there's our video I hope you00:46:42.520 enjoyed today's video and this interview00:46:44.319 that I had with Brett it was a ton of00:46:45.680 fun and I look forward to
