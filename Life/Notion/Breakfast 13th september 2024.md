**Summary and Comparison:**

In Tim Ferriss's book "The 4-Hour Body," he emphasizes a slow-carb diet, which includes consuming protein-rich and low-glycemic foods for breakfast. Key recommendations include:

- **High Protein Intake:** The book suggests starting the day with a high-protein breakfast to boost metabolism and maintain energy levels.
- **Avoiding White Carbohydrates:** Foods like bread, rice, and cereals are discouraged, especially for breakfast.
- **Inclusion of Legumes:** Black beans and other legumes are recommended due to their low-glycemic index and high fiber content.
- **Nutritional Balance:** Emphasis is placed on a balance of macronutrients and the inclusion of essential vitamins and minerals.

**Review of Your Breakfast:**

- **Scrambled Eggs:** High in protein and healthy fats, aligning well with Ferriss's recommendation for a protein-rich breakfast. Eggs also provide essential vitamins and minerals.
- **Black Beans:** Fit perfectly within the slow-carb framework, providing protein, fiber, and essential nutrients like magnesium and iron.
- **Black Coffee:** While not specifically highlighted in Ferriss's breakfast recommendations, black coffee is low in calories and contains antioxidants, fitting within a balanced breakfast.

**Rating: 9/10**

This breakfast aligns very well with the recommendations in "The 4-Hour Body." It provides a high-protein meal with healthy fats and includes legumes, making it a nutritious and balanced start to the day. The only slight improvement could be the addition of a few more vegetables for a wider range of micronutrients.
