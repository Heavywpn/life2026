# Goal Setting & Yearly Planning

### How to setup a New Year

1. First Set the Year up
    1. Open the Years Summary Dashboard and select ‘==NEW==’ to add a new Year. Name the year.
    2. Go to the dashboard and filter your Habit Tracker Database on the Homescreen by the New Year to hide the previous one.
    3. Note you can still view these in the Year Page via the Year Summary Dashboard.
2. Next, setup your Days Database to link to the new year you created.
    1. Select the arrow next to ‘==NEW==’ button on the Days Database
    2. Select ‘…’ next to the Default page template called ‘@Today’ and then select Edit
    3. You will now see a view of the Days database template that says ‘you are editing a template in ‘Days’.
    4. Change the Year Relation property to the new year you create and exit the template page.
3. Create New Habits
    1. these will automatically link to the new year now if you have filtered the Habit Tracker Database view by the new year in stage 1!

  

### How To Set Goals & Review Your Year

All instructions for this process are part of main Goal Tracker & Year Planner Dashboard: Navigate to it and follow the process.

# Calendars

### Calendar Views of Tasks & Projects

If you use **Notion Calendar:** you can use the My calendars view on the homepage to add a view of the tasks database or Projects database to Notion calendar by clicking the Add To calendar Button.

![[BC_SC_Notion_01.08.2024_0049662x.png]]

If you don’t want to use Notion Calendar, you can also work around this: the my favourite go-to option which I still use is the simplest. install a widget of your Google Calendar using Indify.co. It’s super easy.

1. You’ll see a place holder image of my calendar on the view - delete this first
2. Insert your own [Indify.co](http://indify.co) Calendar Widget: Connect Google Calendar using the instructions on Indify. I use two copies of it, one set to month and one set to day view.
3. Create the Calendar, copy the link and paste it in this section as an embed.
4. Whilst you can’t edit the widget: you can simply copy a web link to your Google Calendar above and jump to Google to do so: easy and still my fav.

### How To Manage Tasks: A speedy breakdown of the Getting Things Done Process

_A more detailed breakdown is in the following tab._

The inbox view of this template will show any task you have added that hasn’t yet been processed. They are automatically marked with a status of ‘Inbox’

1. **Use the Important and Urgent check boxes** to set the tasks rating in the **Priority Matrix**: In my opinion this is the minimal bit of task admin needed.
    
    But you can also:
    
2. Consider setting a ‘**Do Date**’ and/or **Deadline** and linking them to a Project
3. Consider adding the task to a **Life Area** via the relation.
    1. You can use the **TOP OF MIND** Area I’ve created for you as a filter for stuff you wish to keep… at the top of your mind!
4. You can link tasks to Life Areas, Projects, both or neither! Use the relation in the task view to link them; and you’ll then see the task within those Area or Project views.
    1. I think **Areas** are great for grouping tasks quickly such as person, work, health etc. **Projects** are for more focused planning on single activities - like a course, a renovation, a creative project.
    2. If a task has more than one actions: it can be considered a project.
        1. Create a Project in the projects inbox and Add it to the system.
        2. In the task inbox - create individual tasks and relate them to that to Project using the relation. This will mean you can then view them and see them reported in related Projects
5. To add any task tasks to the system: click the **Add to System** button or change the Status tag from Inbox

**Strategy to** _**Zero Your Task (inbox or to-do lists) according to David Allen**_

**1.** Is it Actionable?

**2a.** No. Drop it: either _Trash_, _incubate_ to ‘tickler list’ or place in _references_

**2b**. Yes. What’s the Next Action?

**3**. Do (less than 2mins) | Delegate to another | or Defer into

a. Project Lists of next actions

b. Add to Calendar to schedule at specific time

Make sure you watch my older guide video to managing tasks in this system The demo is in my larger Life OS template - but the process is similar. (previous version without the priority matrix)

## Full Guide & Trouble Shooting

---

### 1. Setting Up New Life Areas

Areas are inspired by Tiago Forte’s definition in the PARA Method: Projects, **Areas**, Resources and Archives.

**Use Areas as your top level categories**: Work, Personal Life, Health, Finances, Self Development etc. _Projects_ are for more focused planning on single activities with related tasks such as a course, a renovation, a creative project.

**You can link tasks and/or projects to Life Areas directly**. Use the relation in the task view to link them; and you’ll then see the task within those Area or Project views.

- **Create a New Life Area** with the button on the home page, or by adding directly in a view of the Areas Database.
- N.b. you can link tasks directly to the Area, or link Projects to the Life Area. Linking Projects to an Area will simply report the project, not the tasks within that project - but you can simply click through to that Project to view it’s progress.
- You can use the **TOP OF MIND** Area I’ve created for you as a filter for stuff you wish to keep… at the top of your mind!

  

### 2. Setting Up New Projects

**David Allen suggests that if a task has more than one actions: it is a project.**

1. Create a Project in the projects inbox and Add it to the system.
2. In the task inbox - create individual tasks and relate them to that to Project using the relation. This will mean you can then view them and see them reported in related Projects

- Create a new project with the New Project Button or by clicking new on any Projects Database view. It will pre-populate with the default Project template.
- Name the project.
- You can choose to **link Projects to Life Areas** too: so you can view them within that Area: e.g. Shed Build within your ‘Home’ area, A course project sits with your ‘Studies’ area, etc

Make sure to setup your Weekly Review Project Reminder:

- The **Last Review Date** to previous week-day you like to review projects on - e.g. last Friday.
- Set your **Review Frequency** column to how many days you want between review reminders - e.g. 7 = 7-days. 14 would be every 2-weeks etc.
- Adding tasks within a project page means they will automatically be linked to that project.
- Remember you can turn the example Automations off in any Project database menu - or if you have a paid plan - turn them on, or edit them.

### 3. Adding New Tasks & Processing Them from The Inbox: FULL GUIDE

Make sure you watch my guide video to managing tasks in this system (demo is in my larger Life OS template - but the process is similar - minus the new priority matrix and ‘Add to System’ buttons in this template):

[https://youtu.be/AgJpwe-5-M0](https://youtu.be/AgJpwe-5-M0)

1. Add all the individual tasks you have on your mind to the Tasks inbox on the home screen.
2. You can now **sort & organise your tasks.**
    1. **Use the Important and Urgent check boxes** to set the tasks rating in the **Priority Matrix**: In my opinion this is the minimal bit of task admin needed.
        
        But you can also:
        
    2. Add a **Do Date:** the day you intend to do a task on. It also means the task will appear in Calendar views of task lists. Not adding a do date means they will only be visible in task lists, and priority views
        1. Set a start _and end date_ in the Do Date column if you want a task to last over more than one day on your time lines.
    3. Set a **Deadline Date:** your hard deadline if one exists. This means they will also appear in the deadlines views and the deadline will be reported.
    4. Link tasks to a **Life Area** via the relation to group them.
        1. You can use the **TOP OF MIND** Area I’ve created for you as a filter for stuff you wish to keep… at the top of your mind!
    5. **Link the task to a project:** meaning it will appear also on that Project page and task list.
    6. You can even set a **context** tag so you can e.g. filter a view of tasks by ‘computer’ or a person tag like ‘mum’ (think People, Places or Things)
    7. **You can choose to Assign Tasks** to other workspace users using The Assignee column. They will otherwise automatically be assigned to the person who created them/
    8. **When you task is ready: click the ‘Add To System’ button (or change status from ‘Inbox’):** it will disappear from the inbox and appear in your task manager views below!
3. **When a task is marked complete** it is filtered from all views, but not deleted from Notion. You can find it in the Deleted Tasks Bin view in the System section. You can also view your master under the **System** toggle on the main homepage if you need to.
4. If you want to more permanently completed tasks - this is done in the - a filtered view of the Tasks Database where ‘Done’ is checked. Select the all in bulk and delete.

- If you want to share the system with friends, family or colleagues, you can use the Assignee column to Assign Tasks (you’ll need a paid Notion plan to add more team members, otherwise you can add Guests to pages on free plans - see Notion help for more)

### 4. Use The Quick Drop | Inbox View

Clicking on the title of the The ‘**Quick Drop | Inbox**’ view takes you to a dedicated page view of your inboxes. This is perfect to use with your iOS device to create a Notion widget that links to it. Doing this means you have a quick link on your phone to jump straight to and drop tasks as they come up through the day!

### 5. My Tasks & Top of Mind View

- ALL tasks can be viewed in the my task views once filtered from the inbox. _These views are all filtered to hide tasks marked as either ‘completed’ and ‘inbox’._
- The Priority Views sort task by the priority they have been given from the checkbox choices you added for Urgent and Important
    
    ![[BC_SC_Notion_01.08.2024_0049622x.png]]
    
- Clicking through to the My Tasks page will also show two filtered views: Assigned to Me and TOP OF MIND
    
    - The ‘Assigned To Me’ view sorts all tasks assigned to you, or to nobody. (this works for all users in your workspace).
    - Tasks linked to the TOP OF MIND Area: use this to quickly sort important tasks you want to keep top of mind!
    
    ![[BC_SC_Notion_01.08.2024_0049642x.png]]
    

### 6. Charts & Metrics

- ==**Using & Accessing Notion Charts**==
    
    ==If you are on a Free Notion Plan, you will only be able to view 1 chart. To use unlimited Charts & view all charts in this template you will need a paid Notion plan, or the Notion Education Plan.==
    
    ==To upgrade and sign up for a Pro Notion plan please click== ==[HERE](https://affiliate.notion.so/bettercreating)====!==
    
- ==**Chart Views Explained**==
    - Under the “ My Tasks | Action View “ page, you will see a Metrics heading on the left side towards the top
    - Under this heading, there are embedded charts to show;
        - Live Tasks by Priority
        - Task Status
        - Completed Tasks Daily Tracker
        - Tasks by Assignee
        - Live Tasks Status
    - You can toggle between these by clicking the View Title (e.g. “ Live Tasks Status “ ) and choosing the view you wish to view

### 7. Calendar Views of Tasks & Projects

If you use **Notion Calendar:** you can use the My calendars view on the homepage to add a view of the tasks database or Projects database to Notion calendar by clicking the Add To calendar Button.

![[BC_SC_Notion_01.08.2024_0049662x.png]]

If you don’t want to use Notion Calendar, you can also work around this: the my favourite go-to option which I still use is the simplest. install a widget of your Google Calendar using Indify.co. It’s super easy.

1. You’ll see a place holder image of my calendar on the view - delete this first
2. Insert your own [Indify.co](http://indify.co) Calendar Widget: Connect Google Calendar using the instructions on Indify. I use two copies of it, one set to month and one set to day view.
3. Create the Calendar, copy the link and paste it in this section as an embed.
4. Whilst you can’t edit the widget: you can simply copy a web link to your Google Calendar above and jump to Google to do so: easy and still my fav.
    
      
    
    ![[LifeOS_Guide_Indify_install.gif]]
    

  

  

### 8. Dependent Tasks & The Actionable / Waiting On Report

I’ve set up dependencies for the Tasks database. Simply by adding a task to the ‘blocked by’ or ‘blocking’ property on the task, you will be able to then see a report on each task as to if it is blocking or waiting on another Task! Cool right!?

![[BC_SC_Notion_01.08.2024_0049622x.png]]

### 9. Adding Sub-Tasks

recently Notion released a simple ‘setup sub-tasks’ button for tasks databases: just go to the database menu top right and try it!

### 11. System View*

- clicking in to the System databases will give you views of all your databases: where you can create new master views, or edit the functions as you wish.

### How to set up new Habits

1. ==Add a new habit to the habit tracker database below & link it to the current year. Give it an icon and name.==
2. ==Set the habit duration (by selecting start & end date) and select a frequency you want to do it. 1 = once a week, 7 = everyday. then come back to the mai dashboard.==
3. ==Duplicate one of the above buttons (NOT Journal or Productivity Levels) & click on the ⛭ symbol next to the button to edit it’s functions.==
    1. ==match the name & icon to the Habit tracker page.==
    2. ==Then change the ‘Log Habits’ relation to the new habit you just created.==
    3. ==don’t change the filters! you need it to filter to only change the current day!==

==You can watch a video guide to using this template here:== [https://youtu.be/zynjkETvAuk](https://youtu.be/zynjkETvAuk)

### How to add a new day or automating it to repeat

==You can either add a new day by==

- ==selecting new on the Days database==
- ==using ‘Start New Day’ button on the home screen==
- ==or by setting the default ‘Today’ to repeat ‘every day*==

  

To Automate The Day

1. Select the arrow next to ‘==NEW==’ button on the Days Database
2. Select ‘…’ next to the Default page template called ‘@Today’ and then select ‘Repeat’
3. Set the template to repeat daily, leaving it on the 12 mindnight time
4. Check the timezone is the same as your own and then exit/save the template

_*Note that the repeat option means that the new day will not automatically have it’s date set, but it will have ‘@Today’ written in the title - so you can still identify which day it was._

Done!

  

  

### How to Make the Most of the ‘Today’ Page in ‘Days’

1. The Days database is where you link habit from the Habit database in order to log them… but you can also edit other properties within it to add to you log.
2. Don’t forget: you can put anything within the Today page: it can be your journal and daily reflection space if you like! Why not use ‘/button’ to create options for journaling prompts you can generate in the page? Just edit the ‘Days’ default template page and add what you need there!
3. Click the High / Low / Medium Productivity buttons to decide on your productivity rating for the day - you’ll see it updates the ‘@Today’
4. You can also do mood logging: just click on today’s log and type or select option in the mood column

### How to Track Habits

Do the Habit, check it off using the buttons… OK I know it’s not that simple.

Apple users: try adding a Notion widget to an iOS device that links to the tracker for quick access to the buttons.

Watch this video on how I recommend making habits stick:

### How to Find The System Database + Clearing Demo Data

You’ll find all the master System Databases used in this template in the ‘System Databases’ page at the bottom of the main dashboard. DO NOT DELETE THIS.

- you can however delete entries in those views if you want to clear any examples of old entries.
- All other views within the template are _linked_ ‘/table’ or ‘/calendar’ views (etc) of those databases. In Notion, deleting the linked views will not delete the data in the master databases - since they are really filtered windows to those master. So have a play!

### How to find the Original Dashboard Pages

The Dashboard pages are listed under the System Database Page at the bottom of the home screen. Don’t delete these - they serve the menu options in the synced menu at the top of the page.

### Video Guides & Other Useful Thing Related To This Template

This is a list of videos relevant to each section of the system. There are loads of videos on the Better Creating YouTube channel that will demo how to use this system, and below that; tutorials for building more to add to it!

_- Weights Log, Cardio Log or Classes & Sports Log:_

1. _Duplicate an existing database template in the database menu under the blue arrow,_

# Budgets & Subscriptions

### Basics & Overview & Setup

---

This tracker system is made up of 5 databases in this hierarchy:

- The **Financial Year** Database
    - **Subscriptions** Database (related to financial year only)
    - **Budgets** Database (related to financial year) and then down to:
        - **Income & Invoices** database
        - **Expenditure** Database

**To use it:**

1. Create a new financial year (this year is already set up for the current one)
2. Create new subscriptions, making sure you **link them to the financial year** above
3. Create Budgets, making sure you **link them to the Financial Year above**
4. Add new income and expenditure items in the Budget page, or link them to specific budgets from the main inbox/dashboards.

This ensures everything is reported in your year totals.

## Using The Budget Tracker

---

### Starting A New Year

1. Create a New Financial Year
2. Update the New Subscription Template in the Subscriptions database to be pre-linked to the new financial year (see below for more details)
3. Filter dashboard views if you wish by the new year.

### Setting up Budgets

- To begin managing your budgets, navigate to the “My Budgets & Invoices” section where you’ll see a list of all created budgets. These could represent various financial plans, such as freelance contracts, house renovations, or new work projects.
- To create a new budget, you can either click the ==“New”== button that appears in line with the existing budgets or click the blue “New” button located at the top right of the “Budget Reports” label.
- When setting up a new budget, you’ll need to:
    1. **Fill out the Budget Name**: This should be a descriptive title that clearly identifies the purpose of the budget.
    2. ==**Select the Related Financial Year**====:== Choose the financial year that this budget pertains to, ensuring it aligns with your overall financial planning. _**This is essential for all income, expenditure and data to be reported in the current financial year database!**_
    3. **Enter the Profit Target**: Specify the target profit you aim to achieve for this budget.

### Budgeting / Planning Section

After filling in the basic details, scroll down to access the **“Budget & Planning”** section **within each budget dashboard**. This area allows you to draft your financial plan without affecting the **actual** income or expenses tracked for it. Here, you can predict and plan for the project’s income and expenditure by adding:

- **Item Name**: What the income or expenditure item is.
- **Predicted Amount/Value**: The estimated or planned amount associated with the item.
- **Due Date**: When the income or expense is expected to occur.
- **Recurring Status**: Indicate whether this is a one-time item or a recurring one.
- **Category**: Classify the item under a relevant category (e.g., materials, services, etc.).
- As you fill in this planning database, it will dynamically update based on your predictions, allowing you to visualize your planned budget. Once you’ve input all predicted income, switch tabs to repeat the process for your anticipated expenditures.

### Add & Track Actual Income & Expenditure Items

On the budget page you will see a section called **Add and Track Actuals.**  
This section allows you to add actual income and expenditure to the Income or expenditure database.

- Add new items with the new button on the view, or via the button.
- Fill out the fields for actual income etc as above
- adding items within the budget page will automatically link them to the budget
- adding items on the main budget tracking dashboard views you will need to link the item to the budget manually.

- **Setting up recurring expenses or Income items**
    
    - You can use the repeat feature in database templates to create recurring items that you want to auto generate.
    
    1. Click on the arrow next to the blue NEW button
    2. duplicate the recurring item template via the three dots …
    3. edit this template to be your new recurring item and exit it again
    4. finally, click on the ‘…’ menu for this new recurring template and set the repeat feature to your preferred recurrence. Items will now auto generate on that repeat schedule!

            - Enter in the item name, select if it is a fee or an expense, enter the price, and a brief description. if you need to add more, click “new“ below the current item.
        - **Payable to**

- **Review and Send the Invoice**
