> [!important] **What This Is:**
> 
> A prompted template that will help you reflect on the past year and plan the next one. Through this set of carefully curated prompts & tasks, you can identify patterns from the last year, and design a great vision for the next!  
> **What You’ll Need:** access to your calendar, a few hours of uninterrupted time, and an open and honest approach! Why not share this with friends and invite them to join you for a group reflection & planning session together!  
>   
> Open this page in a new Notion window so you can also view your workspace and calendar as needed. You can drop it into the relevant page in your Years Database after this.

  

> Set up your environment for focused work. Take a few deep breaths. No need to second guess the process, let’s just start 🙂

# The Past Year

## Calendar Review

### 1. What Your Last Year Was About

> [!important] **Go through your calendar week by week.**
> 
> What significant or important events, projects, activities and moments do you spot? reminded of? Write them here. What are you reminded of that isn’t written in the calendar? Add those too.
> 
> If you can’t see the year you need; linking the first entry to that year will make the group visible in the table.
> 
> If you get stuck, take a look at your Wheel of Life (linked in the toggle below from the Goals Dashboard). Our lives can be divided into distinct yet connected areas - you can use these to help:

### 2. Identify Your Wins & Losses

> [!important] It’s time to dive a little deeper. This is my favourite part of the reflection process.
> 
> 1. Work through your list and label the entires as either wins or losses and write down the lessons you learn from them. As you do this, you can also give each event a ‘Life Area’ category. What did you tend to focus on most? Wins or Losses?
> 2. Now Filter by ‘Win’ using the filter button at the top of the database view - and add any others you can think of, and write down the lessons you learn from them.
> 3. Repeat the process, this time filtering by ‘Loss’. I know this seems negative but naming the negative things and taking lessons from them is one of the best things we can do in a review.
> 
> N.b. You can also filter by Life Area if you prefer to think in Areas.

### 3. The 80/20 Recap

> [!important] I love the 80/20 Rule. Identify the 20% of actions that leveraged the biggest impact on your life. Think: What moves the needle the most?!
> 
> - Let’s first identify which 20% of your Wins leveraged the most _**positive**_ impact on your life last year. Check them off in the ‘Best 20% Wins’ tab below. We should do _**more**_ like this!
> - Next, identify which 20% of your Losses leveraged the most _**negative or detrimental**_ impact on your life last year. Check them off in the ‘Worst 20% Losses’ tab. We should do _**less**_ like this!

### 2. Find Your Purpose Prompts

> [!important] These are a few of my favourite well known prompts that can help you discover your focus or the direction you want to travel in the next year. They help you dream big, and visualise how you get perspective before writing your goals. that we’ll write in the next stage - for now: explore!
> 
> *If as you read these you think: no way: that’s too heavy, it’s too much effort, where do i even start: I encourage you to remember: most of the answers are probably already there, inside somewhere - you’re just not looking at them right now. I dare you to let go, avoid _thinking_ too hard and go with your gut… it will be worth it.

|   |
|---|
|**No Fear:** What would you like to do, if you knew you couldn’t fail?|
||
|**Failure is Fine:** What would you like to do, even if you knew you’d fail at it?|
||
|**Role Models:** Who are the people you most admire, and why? What qualities do they possess that you wish to emulate?|
||
|**Your Future Self:** Imagine you’ve achieved everything you ever wanted: what are you like now as a person? What qualities and achievements define you?|
||
|**A Dream Deferred:** What is a dream have you always held but never pursued? Why is it a dream for you? What has been stopping you going for it?|
||
|**An Ordinary Day:** What does your ideal, normal week-day look like? What are you doing, who are you with? Describe thwe details that make it your perfect ordinary day.|
||
|**The Tombstone Prompt:** Yep, it’s that famous one. Write your tombstone message for under your name. It has to be under 280 characters to fit.|
||
|**Write your own Prompt:** Give someone a fishing rod right…? **😜** Try thinking about an area, like change making, experiences, how people relate to you; write a prompt for yourself and answer it!|
||

### 3. Ten-Minute Dream Setting (GOAL SETTING starts here)

> [!important] I discovered this method in 2023 and I love it. It’s a great 10-minute exercise I highly recommend: a great leap-off point when setting goals! My Notion version is based on a combination of ideas I learnt from Ali Abdaal, and a few methods by older self-development authors Jim Rohn, and Zig Ziglar.
> 
> - **Step 1:** Set a timer for 10-minutes and make a list of everything you _might_ want as goals or dreams over the next 10-years. Use my Prompts below if useful.
> - **Step 2:** Next to each item write a time-frame in years number of years that you can imagine for each goal or dream: 1, 3, 5 and 10 Years.
> - **Step 3: Group The Goals by timeframe** 1 Year, 3 Years, 5 Years and 10 Years (this template does it for you - see tab 3 below!)
> 
> > _The point of setting these “goals” for the 3-10 year time horizon isn’t really to actually work towards them right now. The winds of fate are naturally going to change stuff, and no one knows what might happen tomorrow. So these “goals” are obviously not set-in-stone, they’re purely a reflection of the direction that I’d like to be headed towards right now. -_ Ali Adbaal
> 
> Once complete, you can return to the main dashboard where you’ll be able to lay out your goals for the coming year in more detail.
