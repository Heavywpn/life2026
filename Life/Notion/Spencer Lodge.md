should they own our  <br>00:01:40.159 data why should they be in charge of our  <br>00:01:42.159 data why shouldn't we be in charge of  <br>00:01:44.640 our own data why shouldn't we make money

<br>00:04:18.199 honest with you most people are naive  <br>00:04:20.839 ignorant or or I just choose maybe not  <br>00:04:25.360 to want to know what's going on in the  <br>00:04:27.120 world these these flash terms that keep  <br>00:04:28.960 being brought up now nowadays AI you  <br>00:04:30.919 know what does it mean and how can it  <br>00:04:32.360 Implement be implemented in your

what's going on with that but  <br>00:04:42.360 one thing that I think that's really  <br>00:04:43.840 fascinating for me is that I as a  <br>00:04:46.120 content creator for many years have  <br>00:04:47.880 always been highly aware that these  <br>00:04:50.960 institutions these massive organizations  <br>00:04:53.039 the social media companies meta and  <br>00:04:55.199 Facebook and

be yours yeah it's a  <br>00:05:16.360 really good point so when you when you  <br>00:05:18.120 think about what I think take a step  <br>00:05:19.880 back and ask yourself what data is  <br>00:05:22.080 that's the best place to start in a very  <br>00:05:23.600 non-technical way um I look at data as  <br>00:05:26.520 really our stories and our memories and  <br>00:05:28.960 our experiences so if you think about  <br>00:05:31.160 the photographs that you take the things  <br>00:05:33.440 that you want to keep they belong to you  <br>00:05:35.319 in a way but today they don't um you  <br>00:05:38.160 give them to others to look after um  <br>00:05:40.360 there's no insurance around what you  <br>00:05:41.720 hand over um so it could get lost at any  <br>00:05:44.199 moment um so if you start in that point  <br>00:05:46.400 and say okay if these are my stories and  <br>00:05:48.000 my memories how valuable are they to you  <br>00:05:51.039 because that's really where you should  <br>00:05:52.240 start and then you look at data in a  <br>00:05:54.240 very different way because today I think  <br>00:05:55.919 we've been brought up as you rightly say  <br>00:05:57.280 it's key to chat gbt um it's going to  <br>00:05:59.680 give you everything you want but if you  <br>00:06:01.360 break it down you know that's where you  <br>00:06:03.199 should start and say well actually data  <br>00:06:04.560 is personal to me and that's what it  <br>00:06:06.400 means and why shouldn't I own it um  <br>00:06:08.840 that's really the starting point in all  <br>00:06:10.120 of this so when we think about that then  <br>00:06:11.840 let's take some some some common example  <br>00:06:13.440 you say photographs so everything that  <br>00:06:15.919 that I produce as data so that can be  <br>00:06:19.039 stuff that I produce consciously but you  <br>00:06:21.199 know there'll be people that say I never  <br>00:06:22.400 use social media I don't produce data  <br>00:06:24.560 but for those people that think like  <br>00:06:26.120 that what type of data are they  <br>00:06:27.919 producing inadvertently that we can  <br>00:06:29.919 constitute in this conversation so think  <br>00:06:32.400 about how you got to the office this  <br>00:06:34.120 morning so Google Maps is a great  <br>00:06:36.199 example or any map software nopic on  <br>00:06:37.919 Google that journey to work generated  <br>00:06:40.479 data um unknown to you on your way to  <br>00:06:42.880 work you were  <br>00:06:44.080 commoditized because as you drive along  <br>00:06:46.960 people are now suddenly firing  <br>00:06:48.280 advertisements that you just say hey do  <br>00:06:49.680 you want to go to this place do you want  <br>00:06:50.759 to go to that place so even something as  <br>00:06:52.680 simple as driving to work is now making  <br>00:06:55.039 somebody else money but you never get  <br>00:06:57.000 access to that data yourself which you  <br>00:06:59.039 could have used for yourself um after  <br>00:07:01.400 the journey which is then you start  <br>00:07:03.680 thinking about it that way things start  <br>00:07:05.639 to get a bit more interesting because  <br>00:07:06.680 you start to ask yourself the question  <br>00:07:08.840 well what could I have done with that  <br>00:07:10.160 data if it was mine and why is it only  <br>00:07:12.680 being done this way okay that that's one  <br>00:07:16.000 of the big questions that we need to  <br>00:07:17.759 answer today give me some more examples  <br>00:07:20.759 that no not what you could do with it  <br>00:07:22.919 some examp like You' just given because  <br>00:07:24.199 I want to make sure that everyone's Can  <br>00:07:25.840 Be Touched by this so as soon as you  <br>00:07:27.759 just said that to me about Google Maps  <br>00:07:29.280 I'm like like I can go in and look at my  <br>00:07:31.000 map history and I can go and see all  <br>00:07:33.400 these different Journeys that I've taken  <br>00:07:35.080 even even if I've not put them into  <br>00:07:36.879 Google Maps corre so that that triggered  <br>00:07:40.000 me what give me another example of that  <br>00:07:41.919 so um even simple things like your Apple  <br>00:07:44.720 watch and things like that also think  <br>00:07:47.000 about it this way your data that you  <br>00:07:48.840 create is is often  <br>00:07:50.599 duplicated so for example if you own  <br>00:07:53.240 three devices I own an Apple Watch I own  <br>00:07:56.120 an Android phone all of these things I'm  <br>00:07:58.960 repeating the same data I can never  <br>00:08:00.599 connect it I can never pull it apart  <br>00:08:02.960 because it's living in different  <br>00:08:04.080 companies it's my data but it's  <br>00:08:06.159 separated so how many versions of you  <br>00:08:08.319 exist on a daily basis most people have  <br>00:08:10.159 about 100 passwords and don't realize it  <br>00:08:12.520 so your data is never connected which  <br>00:08:14.560 means you can never add to it which  <br>00:08:16.400 means you you're always repeating  <br>00:08:17.840 yourself almost so data is being sold  <br>00:08:20.639 constantly without you knowing behind  <br>00:08:22.159 the scenes but not only that you can't  <br>00:08:24.240 use it to solve your own problems let me  <br>00:08:26.199 explain to you what that means in very  <br>00:08:27.560 simple terms let's think about your  <br>00:08:29.120 health as a great example because we  <br>00:08:30.159 talked about this when we when we first  <br>00:08:31.599 met today not one person alive has a  <br>00:08:34.200 single view of their health um which  <br>00:08:36.519 means that we have all of these apps I  <br>00:08:38.120 have a whoop um a few people have an  <br>00:08:40.159 Apple Watch and so on but they're never  <br>00:08:41.559 connected they're never connected so it  <br>00:08:43.479 means we never get a really true picture  <br>00:08:45.880 of how our health is can we prevent  <br>00:08:47.839 things all of these things that we could  <br>00:08:49.640 if we owned our data and I think that's  <br>00:08:51.880 why ownership is really important  <br>00:08:53.320 because it's not about how much money I  <br>00:08:55.640 make from my data it's actually what it  <br>00:08:57.480 could mean for my life um how it could  <br>00:08:59.600 save my life um if I could connect that  <br>00:09:01.920 data myself wow okay so how do other  <br>00:09:05.920 companies use my data to make money this  <br>00:09:09.600 is like the hidden secret of the  <br>00:09:11.200 internet I think um and this kind of all  <br>00:09:13.519 started around 2003 um believe it or not  <br>00:09:16.399 in the marketing world Google bought  <br>00:09:18.440 AdSense and the internet before that was  <br>00:09:21.079 more of a library almost people  <br>00:09:23.120 connected communities so from like 2003  <br>00:09:25.680 where we are today a lot of then the  <br>00:09:27.760 data that we produce got sold um most  <br>00:09:30.200 people don't realize the way that Amazon  <br>00:09:32.959 says to you well by the way do you want  <br>00:09:34.680 that diaper that follows you around all  <br>00:09:36.720 those websites is because your data is  <br>00:09:38.440 being sold behind the scenes through  <br>00:09:39.839 Brokers and various other companies who  <br>00:09:42.000 are selling data every second to people  <br>00:09:44.399 who want that and a connecting bits of  <br>00:09:46.680 you to basically create that picture and  <br>00:09:49.240 create Revenue which is either for  <br>00:09:51.160 advertising and marketing for that  <br>00:09:52.640 company or data that other people would  <br>00:09:55.120 gladly purchase so they can understand  <br>00:09:57.000 your behavior to try and sell you  <br>00:09:58.839 another product  <br>00:09:59.959 right so let's let's take that as an  <br>00:10:01.240 example I'm a father let's say and I've  <br>00:10:03.160 got young children and I buy diapers  <br>00:10:05.440 okay the the the people that sell the  <br>00:10:07.160 diapers want to advertise to me because  <br>00:10:09.200 I buy the diapers and they can only do  <br>00:10:11.240 that by buying uh by advertising using  <br>00:10:13.399 the data that's sold to them essentially  <br>00:10:15.120 by Facebook and and other companies like  <br>00:10:16.959 that yeah yeah and also use the example  <br>00:10:18.360 in America there's well-known story that  <br>00:10:20.399 a child a girl got pregnant and didn't  <br>00:10:22.279 want to tell her parents but Amazon knew  <br>00:10:23.880 before her parents yes they collected  <br>00:10:26.120 all of the data about her and then they  <br>00:10:27.720 told the DAT Amazon told told her and  <br>00:10:29.839 then her parents found out from Amazon  <br>00:10:31.560 not their daughter because of how much  <br>00:10:33.600 data look as as time progresses we have  <br>00:10:36.600 you and I know we're going to talk about  <br>00:10:37.720 this is we'll have more data about us  <br>00:10:39.959 which will then build an even bigger  <br>00:10:41.440 picture about us and the question then  <br>00:10:43.079 is how much more control do we want  <br>00:10:45.120 about that because how personal it  <br>00:10:46.440 starts to become okay well this this for  <br>00:10:49.000 many people could be scary okay could be  <br>00:10:51.360 frightening first of all frightening the  <br>00:10:52.920 other people are using my data and I  <br>00:10:55.320 just take some simple examples that I'm  <br>00:10:57.160 sure that one or two viewers and  <br>00:10:58.720 listeners might be aware of an  <br>00:11:00.720 inappropriate photo yeah 100% you know  <br>00:11:03.079 an inappropriate photo of something  <br>00:11:05.240 intimate between you and your your wife  <br>00:11:06.839 or your husband that that piece of data  <br>00:11:09.040 you wouldn't want anybody else to see  <br>00:11:10.639 want but but actually there's lots of  <br>00:11:13.399 organizations that have access to it  <br>00:11:15.320 100% um that goes on on a daily basis um  <br>00:11:18.760 I use a term which is a bit  <br>00:11:19.880 controversial the way data storage is  <br>00:11:21.720 today is like unregulated  <br>00:11:23.279 banking um just give me let me sh me out  <br>00:11:26.240 and give you that comparison so today if  <br>00:11:28.240 I put 200 Durham or $20000 into a bank  <br>00:11:31.839 the bank insures me for that um they're  <br>00:11:34.519 also told what they can do with it  <br>00:11:36.320 usually is about 10 times the monetary  <br>00:11:37.839 value they can lend out and there's  <br>00:11:39.560 obviously other regulations and things  <br>00:11:41.000 and I can get it when I want subject to  <br>00:11:42.760 proving my identity and other factors if  <br>00:11:45.079 you think about your photographs today  <br>00:11:46.920 you will upload those but you're not  <br>00:11:48.920 insured if they're  <br>00:11:50.880 lost um and there are some privacy  <br>00:11:53.120 controls in terms of what these  <br>00:11:54.480 companies are allowed to do but they  <br>00:11:56.279 still can do other things if you commit  <br>00:11:57.959 and give your consent so the data  <br>00:11:59.760 related to those photographs can be used  <br>00:12:01.560 for monetization um and then afterwards  <br>00:12:04.040 then as long as you can prove who you  <br>00:12:05.200 are but sometimes they will lock you out  <br>00:12:06.560 anyway because you didn't give enough  <br>00:12:08.120 proof maybe you changed location that's  <br>00:12:09.800 happened to me personally so I always  <br>00:12:11.760 make the question what would be more  <br>00:12:12.920 important to you if your bank lost $200  <br>00:12:16.160 or a cloud provider lost 20 years of  <br>00:12:18.600 your  <br>00:12:19.440 photographs what would be more important  <br>00:12:21.279 to you now that's why I now think data  <br>00:12:24.639 is important to Everyday Life as water  <br>00:12:27.040 and I think data is more important than  <br>00:12:28.440 money because of that simple fact if you  <br>00:12:31.199 lost 20 years of your entire family  <br>00:12:33.320 because of mistake of a cloud provider  <br>00:12:35.320 with no insurance that would mean more  <br>00:12:37.320 to you personally I think than to any  <br>00:12:39.240 amount of money on this Earth good point  <br>00:12:42.639 okay so we know that these external  <br>00:12:45.639 organizations are monetizing the data  <br>00:12:47.680 that that they're gathering on us you  <br>00:12:49.959 you your essentially your belief is that  <br>00:12:53.720 you want to stop that and allow us to  <br>00:12:55.680 have the ownership of our own  <br>00:12:57.720 data so yes and no so um one is about  <br>00:13:01.839 Fair rewards so basically but I also  <br>00:13:05.240 want us to stop thinking about  <br>00:13:06.440 monetizing  <br>00:13:07.600 data because if we think of monetization  <br>00:13:10.399 of data as the answer to everything then  <br>00:13:12.399 that's we're losing sight of the power  <br>00:13:13.800 of data I think when you and I first met  <br>00:13:16.000 I use the term I think data is potential  <br>00:13:18.680 um because that's the other way I look  <br>00:13:19.760 at data it's the potential to innovate  <br>00:13:21.360 it's the potential to save lives and yes  <br>00:13:22.880 we'll make money from data but if that's  <br>00:13:24.959 our only lens on this then we're all  <br>00:13:27.079 missing out because I would even AR that  <br>00:13:29.680 even the ones today that make the money  <br>00:13:31.120 off our data have all missed out because  <br>00:13:33.720 they don't have a single view of our  <br>00:13:34.839 life they only have a version of our  <br>00:13:36.880 life so they can Amazon can only see my  <br>00:13:38.920 Amazon life they have no idea what I  <br>00:13:40.920 watch on Netflix for example so they're  <br>00:13:43.160 only building a version of me that they  <br>00:13:44.880 know so my argument is that if Apple  <br>00:13:48.519 could see all of my data and I allowed  <br>00:13:50.759 them to have it because I owned it it  <br>00:13:52.519 could be worth even more than they are  <br>00:13:53.839 today because they can give me utilities  <br>00:13:56.759 um to manage my health for example which  <br>00:13:58.360 connect all that data which we don't  <br>00:13:59.800 have today but also I could create my  <br>00:14:01.920 own utilities that help me manage my  <br>00:14:03.759 health or other things and yes of course  <br>00:14:05.639 I'll monetize my data which is a big  <br>00:14:07.720 part of the AI story today um where we  <br>00:14:10.079 know that a lot of people's data has  <br>00:14:11.480 being used to build AI without their  <br>00:14:13.000 knowledge but my argument is well we  <br>00:14:15.880 need Ai and AI needs us and a big part  <br>00:14:18.199 of that is also a fair reward for how  <br>00:14:20.199 our data has been used to create Ai and  <br>00:14:22.399 constantly how it's used so it's a  <br>00:14:23.839 mixture of the people who take our data  <br>00:14:26.639 today also getting benefit but more me  <br>00:14:29.440 as a consumer I also get a benefit  <br>00:14:31.720 because now what I'm using is a  <br>00:14:33.440 reflection of how unique I am and who I  <br>00:14:36.000 am rather than a generic view of  <br>00:14:38.959 myself if if you if if we take  <br>00:14:41.160 monetization and just park it for one  <br>00:14:42.759 minute and and and look at how those  <br>00:14:44.360 other companies use the data they're  <br>00:14:45.920 using the data so that it can be  <br>00:14:48.279 effective in certain ways the thing the  <br>00:14:49.839 thing that kind of resonates I'm curious  <br>00:14:51.519 about now is Health okay because that's  <br>00:14:54.880 the one thing that's the most important  <br>00:14:56.199 thing to all of us although some of us  <br>00:14:57.639 seem to be on a a mission of death a lot  <br>00:14:59.639 of the time um that bit that you said  <br>00:15:02.839 resonates me you you wear a whoop you  <br>00:15:04.560 know I wear a Garin and and and you've  <br>00:15:06.759 got your Apple watch and these two  <br>00:15:08.199 devices aren't talking to each other and  <br>00:15:10.279 that's just these two that are on your  <br>00:15:11.720 wrist let alone um all of the other  <br>00:15:14.399 information that's gathered about your  <br>00:15:16.040 health in different ways how can how can  <br>00:15:19.040 what you're proposing how can that help  <br>00:15:22.680 me so let me probably give a really I'm  <br>00:15:26.800 always open and honest with my my  <br>00:15:28.360 audience so recently um I was told you  <br>00:15:31.360 know you're at the age Spencer but you  <br>00:15:32.880 need to have a thumb put up your bum so  <br>00:15:34.639 that you can check your  <br>00:15:36.319 colon all right and I was like I  <br>00:15:38.360 probably been hearing that for five or  <br>00:15:39.759 six years and then someone who's a bit  <br>00:15:42.279 older than me a friend of mine he said  <br>00:15:43.800 to me said you need to get it done okay  <br>00:15:45.639 A friend of mine got sick he had some  <br>00:15:47.199 cancer blah blah blah you know you need  <br>00:15:48.480 to go and get it checked and so I was um  <br>00:15:51.440 I was reticent to go as I think most men  <br>00:15:53.519 are but I but I eventually conceded and  <br>00:15:55.720 went to the hospital here and um had a  <br>00:15:57.920 camera put where it shouldn't go and uh  <br>00:16:00.279 uh the work that was done to find out  <br>00:16:01.680 that I was all  <br>00:16:04.600 good that information  <br>00:16:07.639 there has impact on other information on  <br>00:16:11.160 other parts of my body and other parts  <br>00:16:12.600 of Health okay cancer is something that  <br>00:16:15.959 spreads into other parts of our body as  <br>00:16:17.560 an example when we when we own our own  <br>00:16:20.920 data are you suggesting that we're able  <br>00:16:24.319 essentially to combine all of this  <br>00:16:26.079 different information from the hospital  <br>00:16:28.000 that I went to here the American  <br>00:16:29.360 Hospital so the one five year or 10  <br>00:16:30.880 years ago I had my spinal surgery in  <br>00:16:32.560 London um to to the one where I had my  <br>00:16:35.279 my my clavicle done and the metal plate  <br>00:16:37.000 put in there when I fell off my bike at  <br>00:16:38.600 the medic Medicare place here um is it  <br>00:16:42.360 just Gathering all of that together and  <br>00:16:44.279 putting it in a place where there's that  <br>00:16:46.360 can be then read and understood and  <br>00:16:48.639 further diagnosis can be done to  <br>00:16:50.720 optimize my health correct and this is  <br>00:16:52.560 where the AI story comes in okay so  <br>00:16:55.240 today we've been told a narrative that  <br>00:16:57.160 AI is better than us right a lot of the  <br>00:16:59.360 narrative because it's created a divide  <br>00:17:01.000 in society right we have to admit that  <br>00:17:03.319 there's parts of the world that think  <br>00:17:04.480 it's going to solve everything we've  <br>00:17:06.000 ever had a problem with there's the  <br>00:17:07.760 other half of the world that are rightly  <br>00:17:08.959 concerned and think we're going to lose  <br>00:17:10.119 our jobs the reality is I think we're  <br>00:17:12.240 moving into an era of collaborative  <br>00:17:14.039 collaborative AI where humans and AI  <br>00:17:16.319 will work together but on people's own  <br>00:17:18.520 data so let's take your example um I  <br>00:17:21.760 work out quite a lot so when I first met  <br>00:17:23.799 my PT she knows nothing about me she  <br>00:17:26.160 only knows what I tell her yeah and then  <br>00:17:28.039 we figure that out through the sessions  <br>00:17:30.640 um it's lucky that she specializes in  <br>00:17:32.200 biomechanics so she can actually figure  <br>00:17:33.799 out as she goes along but wouldn't it be  <br>00:17:35.919 useful if you took all of that data that  <br>00:17:38.120 you've just collected and then you could  <br>00:17:40.120 show her where your injuries are what  <br>00:17:42.600 you have and then all a sudden then you  <br>00:17:44.160 get an excise program that's taken for  <br>00:17:45.679 you even your AI could probably say to  <br>00:17:48.480 you on all your data um hey Spencer um I  <br>00:17:51.760 can see all these injuries I can see  <br>00:17:53.200 bits about your nutrition maybe you want  <br>00:17:55.200 to think about XYZ because the reality  <br>00:17:57.559 is AI is not going to queue at cancer  <br>00:17:59.760 but with your own data might be able to  <br>00:18:01.360 prevent it because through predictions  <br>00:18:03.880 and patterns and past examples in your  <br>00:18:06.400 life I can bring all that data together  <br>00:18:08.400 and suddenly I have a different picture  <br>00:18:09.799 of you and this is the really important  <br>00:18:11.600 bit the way the AI is being developed  <br>00:18:13.520 today is trying to treat everybody the  <br>00:18:14.679 same with the way it reports and gives  <br>00:18:17.000 you Insight the reality is we're all  <br>00:18:18.480 unique the story you've just said is  <br>00:18:20.320 unique to you yeah so in a way only you  <br>00:18:23.360 can really self diagnose if because  <br>00:18:25.840 basically you'd have to go and see all  <br>00:18:26.919 of those doctors individually m someone  <br>00:18:29.440 who's amazing to piece that story  <br>00:18:31.120 together um but if you had all your data  <br>00:18:33.159 and AI was there all of a sudden now  <br>00:18:35.120 that story changes because what it's  <br>00:18:37.159 giving you advice on is what makes you  <br>00:18:39.440 unique which is those life events and  <br>00:18:41.799 that data effectively and we've  <br>00:18:44.039 established clearly now in the world not  <br>00:18:47.280 everybody's the same we know that people  <br>00:18:48.880 are different and so the same exercise  <br>00:18:50.440 program nutrition program or whatever it  <br>00:18:52.120 may be is not going to work on everyone  <br>00:18:54.400 how does how does that  <br>00:18:56.240 that how does that then get translated  <br>00:18:59.520 because if it's Gathering that  <br>00:19:00.679 information and it's suggesting it how  <br>00:19:03.200 is it suggesting it and and you know is  <br>00:19:05.000 it is it then providing that information  <br>00:19:06.960 to a holistic doctor that then says  <br>00:19:08.720 right I've understood everything now  <br>00:19:11.000 based upon all this information that's  <br>00:19:12.280 been gathered over the last 54 years of  <br>00:19:13.880 your life spener this is the direction  <br>00:19:16.039 you need to head in or is that going to  <br>00:19:17.600 be something that that that that that  <br>00:19:19.120 allows us to understand it so that we  <br>00:19:21.240 can then plan with it so this this opens  <br>00:19:23.200 up another question or at least an area  <br>00:19:25.480 of focus so a lot of the work that I've  <br>00:19:28.400 been doing doing in this space and it  <br>00:19:30.400 dawned on me that we also don't yet have  <br>00:19:33.240 the skills needed to interpret what AI  <br>00:19:35.080 is going to give us and and some of  <br>00:19:37.440 that's not our fault that's just our  <br>00:19:39.520 dependency on technology over time so we  <br>00:19:42.240 have to reason with ourselves and  <br>00:19:43.960 understand that we become visual  <br>00:19:45.559 thinkers um the average person now  <br>00:19:47.840 apparently has an attention span of 8  <br>00:19:49.559 seconds um the last big attacks in terms  <br>00:19:52.240 of where people's data was stolen was  <br>00:19:54.320 because of human error um and data  <br>00:19:56.559 literacy is the worst it's ever been so  <br>00:19:59.280 the the real value of ownership of data  <br>00:20:00.960 and I would argue treating data like an  <br>00:20:02.440 asset would mean children are now  <br>00:20:04.679 educated on how to read it how to think  <br>00:20:06.840 critically how to debate how to reason  <br>00:20:09.400 so that's the other reason that  <br>00:20:10.679 ownership of data is really important  <br>00:20:12.280 because then we will teach people how to  <br>00:20:14.440 read it um so look you're not I'm not  <br>00:20:16.720 saying you're going to replace your  <br>00:20:17.840 doctor but at least some of these things  <br>00:20:19.919 may give you advice which are not  <br>00:20:21.799 life-threatening and there will be a  <br>00:20:23.360 moment where we say well actually you  <br>00:20:24.559 probably should see a doctor because of  <br>00:20:26.559 what I can see but also your past  <br>00:20:28.080 history but you know what the thing the  <br>00:20:30.360 thing that sticks out for me more than  <br>00:20:31.799 anything else is is the whole preventing  <br>00:20:33.880 correct you know for me it's like if if  <br>00:20:36.360 people  <br>00:20:37.559 knew that they this data could help them  <br>00:20:41.360 prevent yeah getting cancer which  <br>00:20:43.559 impacts one in two people one or two  <br>00:20:45.120 women anyway um on this planet that that  <br>00:20:49.679 that  <br>00:20:52.760 literally will save more lives than a  <br>00:20:55.320 war on or apocalypse would ever take let  <br>00:20:57.520 me give you a real good example I met  <br>00:20:59.360 this lady on a plane I'm I'm sure she  <br>00:21:00.720 will remind me telling this story um I  <br>00:21:03.480 got in a plane and there was a lady  <br>00:21:05.039 opposite me very sitting in a very  <br>00:21:06.240 uncomfortable position um I she had  <br>00:21:08.360 pillows and towels and things and I  <br>00:21:10.279 asked her we got talking and I said why  <br>00:21:12.240 are you sat like that she said back  <br>00:21:13.679 cancer I said how did you find that out  <br>00:21:16.159 and she broke her back in the gym  <br>00:21:17.919 training um which was unusual because  <br>00:21:20.039 she was so young so the doctor analyzed  <br>00:21:22.480 unfortunately you've got back cancer and  <br>00:21:23.880 you're stage four right months and  <br>00:21:27.200 months and months later shakula  <br>00:21:29.400 doctors don't know how a mixture of what  <br>00:21:32.120 she thought she should do with medical  <br>00:21:34.520 advice but whatever it did it worked  <br>00:21:37.559 she's a life coach so I asked her I said  <br>00:21:39.640 well what did you do she said well I  <br>00:21:41.360 can't remember really but because I'm a  <br>00:21:43.240 life coach now people now want me to  <br>00:21:44.679 help them in a similar position and I  <br>00:21:46.880 said to her well if you owned your data  <br>00:21:49.720 you could have collected everything that  <br>00:21:51.039 you did and then wouldn't it be amazing  <br>00:21:53.799 if you could share that value with  <br>00:21:55.000 someone else you take your data set and  <br>00:21:57.520 you give it to someone who's got the  <br>00:21:58.720 same as you and their AI combines their  <br>00:22:01.480 data with your data and suddenly they  <br>00:22:03.760 find the answer that's unique to that  <br>00:22:05.840 individual based on your learnings and  <br>00:22:08.000 who's to say you then give that to a  <br>00:22:10.159 pharmaceutical company who then instead  <br>00:22:12.200 of generating a pill they generate  <br>00:22:15.000 everybody an algorithm so that everybody  <br>00:22:17.200 then can follow that and manage their  <br>00:22:18.440 own health in a similar condition that's  <br>00:22:20.720 what we're talking about we have enough  <br>00:22:22.679 data in the world and enough technology  <br>00:22:25.080 now to get us to a place where if we  <br>00:22:27.200 treat data like an asset we could  <br>00:22:29.440 prevent much more than just the health  <br>00:22:33.880 side  <br>00:22:36.200 wow but wow with a which begs the  <br>00:22:39.679 question why has this not already  <br>00:22:42.880 happened it makes me makes me feel sad  <br>00:22:45.799 that something as as as remarkable and  <br>00:22:48.880 impactful as that that there there are  <br>00:22:51.960 so many more things in the world that  <br>00:22:53.279 we're spending time money and effort on  <br>00:22:54.760 right now but that seems to me as like  <br>00:22:57.480 the biggest game changer the planet  <br>00:22:59.120 could ever face it's a it's a history  <br>00:23:01.679 that's often been Untold um we've I've  <br>00:23:04.880 sold it wow that's massive though isn't  <br>00:23:08.120 it it is I as I just start and process  <br>00:23:10.960 that I mean it's like that if you could  <br>00:23:14.159 actually do that so if you take that to  <br>00:23:16.080 its full end degree with the technology  <br>00:23:18.480 we're having now when you're born I  <br>00:23:20.679 could give you a digital twin of view  <br>00:23:23.120 and I could AB test you based on your  <br>00:23:25.520 own data and what your parents inherited  <br>00:23:27.360 to you as a piece of data so if you were  <br>00:23:29.200 born with diabetes for example and your  <br>00:23:31.559 parents had diabetes or one of them  <br>00:23:33.360 throughout their life and they pass on  <br>00:23:35.360 that data belongs to them so they would  <br>00:23:37.520 give it to you as an inheritance and  <br>00:23:40.240 then you could run that on the AI which  <br>00:23:42.039 could be 20 years later digital twin  <br>00:23:44.200 technology exist where you can take a  <br>00:23:45.679 replica of a machine today I could take  <br>00:23:47.400 a replica R you and then use the same  <br>00:23:49.799 data to see what medication would work  <br>00:23:51.360 before I even give it to you that's a  <br>00:23:53.400 10year vision that is completely  <br>00:23:55.320 possible um but again you've got to  <br>00:23:57.640 start with not the technology and this  <br>00:23:59.559 goes back to your question why don't we  <br>00:24:00.919 have it now is because our focus is in  <br>00:24:03.039 the wrong place we see the technology as  <br>00:24:05.880 the answer but the real power has been  <br>00:24:07.480 there all along which is the data the  <br>00:24:09.799 identity and the value it  <br>00:24:11.760 generates so the more we SP Focus Less  <br>00:24:14.559 on technology and more on data what I'm  <br>00:24:17.400 describing is just literally scratching  <br>00:24:19.480 the surface health is just one example  <br>00:24:21.880 you you go on and on in terms of what we  <br>00:24:23.640 can see because the other problem is  <br>00:24:26.399 Spencer we've been brought up to believe  <br>00:24:27.720 that data means  <br>00:24:28.880 monetization but actually data is a  <br>00:24:31.000 utility and a store value at exactly the  <br>00:24:33.000 same time what does that mean well one I  <br>00:24:35.000 can use it to make money for myself if  <br>00:24:36.919 an AI uses my algorithm I'll get paid  <br>00:24:38.760 many times over which is great but the  <br>00:24:40.799 other amazing thing for me is I can use  <br>00:24:43.440 the create utilities I've just  <br>00:24:45.440 described um imagine you've got an AI  <br>00:24:47.720 with your data and suddenly it says to  <br>00:24:49.720 you Spencer you can see you've got a  <br>00:24:51.080 health app but you're missing some data  <br>00:24:53.240 that would help you why don't you go to  <br>00:24:55.000 a hike in some far off country you rest  <br>00:24:59.080 but you'll collect dat that's really  <br>00:25:00.600 valuable to others and you and you could  <br>00:25:03.240 sell that on an exchange and make some  <br>00:25:05.120 money for yourself but at the same time  <br>00:25:07.120 it would build a bigger picture of your  <br>00:25:08.520 health but improve your cardiovascular  <br>00:25:10.799 system it's like sold why wouldn't you  <br>00:25:13.760 yeah absolutely yeah gee man it's just  <br>00:25:18.000 like it's so exciting it's like it's  <br>00:25:22.159 like okay a lot of time a lot of time  <br>00:25:25.320 it's always about how can it be  <br>00:25:27.279 implemented okay you know what what are  <br>00:25:29.120 the practical steps of being implemented  <br>00:25:31.120 so I know that you've put some thought  <br>00:25:32.720 into this that's why you're sat here  <br>00:25:34.120 today but um tell me what when you had  <br>00:25:37.799 these realizations and the were these  <br>00:25:39.559 moments for you big moments like they  <br>00:25:41.159 are for as I'm listening to it now they  <br>00:25:42.919 they were yeah so so the story with this  <br>00:25:44.799 goes back four years I was asked to  <br>00:25:46.360 write a paper a very long time ago on  <br>00:25:48.520 what the future of data would be in 2030  <br>00:25:51.279 and I I kind of had those he in the  <br>00:25:52.760 moment you know here standing up moments  <br>00:25:54.320 in a room where it's was like it dawned  <br>00:25:56.279 on me this was much more important that  <br>00:25:57.960 I'd be asked to do um but it also dawned  <br>00:26:01.760 on me we need to do more um and we need  <br>00:26:05.600 to know more about this and that's kind  <br>00:26:07.640 of what started the journey I think we  <br>00:26:09.399 all have these moments where we find  <br>00:26:10.919 something or we start something and it  <br>00:26:12.320 gets bigger than ourselves this is what  <br>00:26:14.320 it became so yeah they then what I'm  <br>00:26:16.760 doing and what I've been have done is  <br>00:26:19.279 doing exactly what you just asked which  <br>00:26:21.000 is the steps to get there either for a  <br>00:26:23.080 government to put this in place so some  <br>00:26:25.080 of these longer term or even near term  <br>00:26:26.840 Things become a reality  <br>00:26:28.960 but also what are the fundamental things  <br>00:26:31.559 that we need in this but also not  <br>00:26:32.919 forgetting the role that people play in  <br>00:26:34.279 all of this which I think is close to  <br>00:26:36.159 your heart everyone we met as well  <br>00:26:37.399 talking about people and organizations  <br>00:26:38.960 and their roles and I'm sure we'll come  <br>00:26:40.919 on to that is their importance in it so  <br>00:26:42.799 yeah the the the steps are really  <br>00:26:44.039 important I can go through some of those  <br>00:26:45.840 if absolutely we need to go I want to be  <br>00:26:48.880 I want make sure everybody not only sits  <br>00:26:51.039 there and has just done what I've done  <br>00:26:52.480 as you've explained what you explained  <br>00:26:53.760 but you know what are these what are  <br>00:26:55.440 these moves that we need to make so if  <br>00:26:57.200 you think about so what makes ownership  <br>00:26:59.000 possible obviously starts with the  <br>00:27:00.720 regulator and the government um I'm  <br>00:27:03.279 fortunate to be living in Dubai and I  <br>00:27:04.919 can have those conversations and it's  <br>00:27:07.640 exciting and it probably won't surprise  <br>00:27:09.600 you how open they are to those  <br>00:27:11.240 conversations the first step in anything  <br>00:27:13.080 is recognizing people's legal right to  <br>00:27:14.600 own their data that's that's the first  <br>00:27:15.960 big tick um we mustn't underestimate the  <br>00:27:18.480 role of your identity with that because  <br>00:27:20.399 you are your data and that's how you  <br>00:27:21.760 prove yourself so those two are  <br>00:27:23.559 critically important I think then  <br>00:27:25.480 there's the awareness like this podcast  <br>00:27:27.799 is giv people that awareness but I think  <br>00:27:29.880 then regulators and other organizations  <br>00:27:31.520 then will have to make people aware of  <br>00:27:32.880 what that means in the near term people  <br>00:27:35.520 can help themselves um they can actually  <br>00:27:38.600 think more clearly about what they do  <br>00:27:40.279 with their data in the short term maybe  <br>00:27:42.360 work with companies where they can  <br>00:27:43.720 access their data and use it themselves  <br>00:27:46.600 um and just become more Curious over  <br>00:27:48.840 time some of the work I'm doing is  <br>00:27:50.679 helping build the curriculums for  <br>00:27:52.320 schools in terms of how children now can  <br>00:27:54.519 become critical thinkers again and learn  <br>00:27:57.080 to reason so then they will be in a  <br>00:27:58.720 position to actually use their data with  <br>00:28:00.480 an AI in the right way um but the  <br>00:28:03.480 biggest thing you know that's what you  <br>00:28:04.519 can do as individual and that's what  <br>00:28:05.600 needs to be done at a government level  <br>00:28:07.200 there's a raft of technology behind all  <br>00:28:08.919 of this I'm very fortunate to be working  <br>00:28:10.600 with people on those um but yeah that's  <br>00:28:12.679 your starting point one is educate  <br>00:28:14.200 yourself and build an awareness of these  <br>00:28:16.360 things and also ask yourself the  <br>00:28:18.200 question why and what could I do and the  <br>00:28:20.279 second part of the equation is  <br>00:28:21.320 unfortunately we can't do anything until  <br>00:28:23.279 the government gives us a helping hand  <br>00:28:24.720 and that's part of the work that I'm  <br>00:28:25.720 doing when you talk to governments about  <br>00:28:27.919 a subject matter like this do they  <br>00:28:30.039 immediately jump on it and say we get it  <br>00:28:32.039 we understand it we want to try and do  <br>00:28:33.440 something about it or do you get um for  <br>00:28:36.360 obvious reasons I would suspect push  <br>00:28:38.240 back a little bit of push back but  <br>00:28:40.399 that's only because I think the way that  <br>00:28:42.760 we've been taught what data is so we've  <br>00:28:46.080 touched on that we've been taught data  <br>00:28:47.640 is monetization we've also been taught  <br>00:28:49.880 that data is  <br>00:28:50.960 fear which is where data privacy comes  <br>00:28:53.320 from yeah so people have been I guess  <br>00:28:56.279 told it's scary to share your look after  <br>00:28:58.799 it don't use it so then we constantly  <br>00:29:01.679 have privacy rules when actually that's  <br>00:29:03.320 probably not the answer the answer is  <br>00:29:05.440 now ownership in Choice which is the  <br>00:29:07.600 conversation I have with the regulator  <br>00:29:09.000 to say look let's be realistic we're  <br>00:29:11.279 going to have an AI fairly soon that no  <br>00:29:13.080 one's ever going to be able to keep up  <br>00:29:14.200 with they the regulator so do we  <br>00:29:16.559 actually then say maybe there's a  <br>00:29:18.320 different model which is we give people  <br>00:29:20.399 the ownership and choice we give them  <br>00:29:21.799 the technology to do that and maybe the  <br>00:29:24.080 regulator then shifts their attention to  <br>00:29:25.679 what really matters which is security  <br>00:29:27.159 and ethics and then the game changes but  <br>00:29:30.320 then more importantly you talk to the  <br>00:29:31.720 regulator around look this isn't about  <br>00:29:33.720 monetization this is about giving people  <br>00:29:35.279 the things they've never had I would  <br>00:29:36.679 even argue what even businesses have  <br>00:29:38.480 never had and if you bring this into  <br>00:29:41.640 fruition you will open up innovation in  <br>00:29:43.919 a national level National level because  <br>00:29:46.320 you will now invite fex companies who  <br>00:29:49.399 will help people and businesses use data  <br>00:29:52.159 in the way that I'm describing so you  <br>00:29:53.840 create an ecosystem and an economy  <br>00:29:55.399 around this that's why it's exciting for  <br>00:29:57.320 the regulator because now you create a  <br>00:29:58.799 culture of innovation but also you  <br>00:30:00.919 create a new Workforce you build the  <br>00:30:03.760 Next Generation and you almost build you  <br>00:30:06.000 know the underpinnings of of a new way  <br>00:30:11.200 forward how cool is  <br>00:30:13.480 that talk to me about how you link the  <br>00:30:16.360 blockchain with the ambition here  <br>00:30:19.080 because I think that and again let's  <br>00:30:20.519 just make sure that there'll be there'll  <br>00:30:22.000 be people here that don't understand  <br>00:30:23.159 really what the blockchain has said I  <br>00:30:24.519 don't want to jump too too deep into  <br>00:30:26.679 that but I want people to to understand  <br>00:30:29.240 the connection because we just had uh in  <br>00:30:31.440 the Press yesterday uh an announcement  <br>00:30:33.840 that M2 is going to allow people to um  <br>00:30:37.360 uh trade trade their uh ethereum and  <br>00:30:39.919 Bitcoin in their local currency in their  <br>00:30:41.919 bank accounts here the government of Abu  <br>00:30:43.519 Dhabi have just to authorize that which  <br>00:30:45.519 I think will you know less and more and  <br>00:30:49.640 more take people to less and less fear  <br>00:30:51.480 around the whole world of crypto because  <br>00:30:53.760 it's becoming normalized and we heard  <br>00:30:55.720 what Trump's saying if he gets back into  <br>00:30:57.159 Power what he's going to do as well so  <br>00:30:59.159 that's I I hope bringing more people  <br>00:31:01.159 into this place of not thinking that you  <br>00:31:03.559 know crypto is some crazy nutty scam and  <br>00:31:06.320 and the blockchain and web3 is uh is  <br>00:31:08.279 Bonkers so just in really simple terms  <br>00:31:11.880 how are you doing what you're doing  <br>00:31:13.600 there so you've used the magic words so  <br>00:31:15.799 bit Bonkers no that is also a magic word  <br>00:31:18.360 because you haveed Bonkers to put the  <br>00:31:19.559 pieces together um so Bitcoin and  <br>00:31:22.639 ethereum I look at data as the brother  <br>00:31:25.080 and sister of both of them because  <br>00:31:27.240 Bitcoin is a story value MH ethereum is  <br>00:31:29.880 programmable data is  <br>00:31:31.960 both so what if you made data a  <br>00:31:34.679 token itself and what if you could store  <br>00:31:38.039 it on a ledger in terms of every time  <br>00:31:40.440 it's used who has it because that's  <br>00:31:42.039 really what the blockchain is right it's  <br>00:31:43.279 a mutable record of something that was  <br>00:31:45.760 stored in a ledger like in the olden  <br>00:31:48.000 days where we'd have a be some you know  <br>00:31:49.480 Ledger ins and outs big books big books  <br>00:31:51.760 right the lines in exactly now now now  <br>00:31:53.799 it's digital um and the currency is is  <br>00:31:56.720 is data uh my argument is the currency  <br>00:31:59.279 now is intelligence because actually  <br>00:32:01.600 what we're sharing is knowledge and I  <br>00:32:03.240 can tokenize it and I can store in a  <br>00:32:05.320 blockchain okay so let's let's just Dum  <br>00:32:07.440 that down a little bit okay tokenize it  <br>00:32:09.720 so we can create a a Bitcoin 2.0 or we  <br>00:32:12.799 can we can whatever we want to call it  <br>00:32:14.919 okay let's let's call it let's call it  <br>00:32:17.200 whatever we want but it essentially  <br>00:32:19.120 becomes its very own token that sits  <br>00:32:22.559 alongside all of the other tokens as as  <br>00:32:24.760 an asset that you can buy and trade and  <br>00:32:28.720 that that data itself then each each  <br>00:32:31.919 piece of data is owned by whoever the  <br>00:32:33.559 owner is correct and his access for a  <br>00:32:35.639 wallet that you hold the word asset  <br>00:32:38.639 though is what you said is really  <br>00:32:39.919 important um because a lot of the work  <br>00:32:42.000 I'm doing is making data into a real  <br>00:32:43.639 world asset so treating it like water so  <br>00:32:47.600 if you think of the outage that happened  <br>00:32:49.159 a few weeks ago or a week ago now isn't  <br>00:32:50.880 it um where you know major system change  <br>00:32:54.120 for the first time I guess locked us all  <br>00:32:55.880 out of our computers okay so the so for  <br>00:32:58.360 people that that aren't familiar with it  <br>00:32:59.919 here in the world recently if you're  <br>00:33:01.720 under under a rock we had they said  <br>00:33:04.639 someone turned a switch or fress a  <br>00:33:06.039 button somewhere in a cyber security  <br>00:33:07.639 company I foret Cloud strike I think it  <br>00:33:09.799 was and and basically many many people  <br>00:33:13.360 shops couldn't use their terminals to  <br>00:33:15.120 take payments and you know all kinds of  <br>00:33:17.639 computer systems crashed what that  <br>00:33:19.519 showed to me and I hope it showed to the  <br>00:33:21.519 world is that data is now as more  <br>00:33:23.480 important as life as long as water  <br>00:33:26.200 because because we couldn't access data  <br>00:33:27.960 because we couldn't use it in our jobs  <br>00:33:29.720 all of a sudden the world stopped right  <br>00:33:31.919 because really what the computer was was  <br>00:33:33.240 just a device to create and show a state  <br>00:33:36.320 so when we start saying well data is an  <br>00:33:38.720 asset and you ask me blockchain and  <br>00:33:40.880 token the real value is when it becomes  <br>00:33:43.159 a real world asset because now everybody  <br>00:33:44.840 touches that data becomes a critical  <br>00:33:46.480 service  <br>00:33:48.440 provider they become regulated in terms  <br>00:33:50.799 of how they handle and manage data like  <br>00:33:52.360 the water company so I can't imagine the  <br>00:33:55.000 water company ever having a crisis like  <br>00:33:56.679 that and nobody ever been able to drink  <br>00:33:58.440 water in in a development bills it's the  <br>00:34:00.840 same thing he would just put extra  <br>00:34:02.399 layers of Regulation and the companies  <br>00:34:04.519 that store your data today would also be  <br>00:34:06.360 treated as a regulated entity so then  <br>00:34:08.599 all of a sudden then you've got a  <br>00:34:10.440 technology that allows you to move data  <br>00:34:12.199 around securely and safely and makes it  <br>00:34:14.079 traceable which is what we're talking  <br>00:34:15.440 about but also then the companies and  <br>00:34:17.480 the facilitator and look after for you  <br>00:34:19.399 are also treated as critical service  <br>00:34:21.119 providers so everything then changes  <br>00:34:23.839 because then you look at data then as  <br>00:34:25.399 not something that belongs in a system  <br>00:34:27.399 but it's it's actually critical to  <br>00:34:28.760 everything that we do you know for your  <br>00:34:30.560 listeners have a think about when you  <br>00:34:32.159 had breakfast this morning to when you  <br>00:34:33.440 went to bed how many things did you  <br>00:34:35.239 touch gave you data the screen you  <br>00:34:37.399 looked at the alarm clock in the morning  <br>00:34:38.960 that's digital all of those things are  <br>00:34:40.800 data really and they become so important  <br>00:34:43.119 to everyday life that we've lost sight  <br>00:34:45.239 of it which is why the technology allows  <br>00:34:47.679 us to make this possible but at the same  <br>00:34:49.800 time the regulation then allows us to  <br>00:34:51.320 change our  <br>00:34:53.800 mindset can I want to I want to get back  <br>00:34:56.040 to getting to some some kind of like mic  <br>00:34:58.200 drop moments here so we can we can get  <br>00:35:00.240 people that might have got a little bit  <br>00:35:02.119 confused by that excited again we talked  <br>00:35:03.880 about health yeah okay what a g give me  <br>00:35:06.200 some other give me some other fun  <br>00:35:07.720 examples of where where our audience  <br>00:35:10.160 right now will S I didn't know it could  <br>00:35:12.200 do that that would be cool for me if it  <br>00:35:14.119 could do this give me a couple of  <br>00:35:15.359 examples around that kind of stuff so  <br>00:35:17.400 let's go let s Finance okay um so  <br>00:35:20.280 there's a few things one I actually  <br>00:35:21.359 really want to do I'm kind of giving it  <br>00:35:22.760 do I give this away give it away I don't  <br>00:35:24.680 G to do anything with it I think you  <br>00:35:26.520 could build a data Bond what's a data  <br>00:35:28.560 Bond so in in financial terms you can  <br>00:35:30.359 you can invest in a bond yeah so this is  <br>00:35:32.440 basically where a government or an  <br>00:35:33.680 organization wants to wants to borrow  <br>00:35:35.240 money so say they're building a property  <br>00:35:37.920 um or even a group of properties they  <br>00:35:39.800 would issue a bond and they'll collect  <br>00:35:41.400 the money from people who will then get  <br>00:35:43.400 make money out of that property  <br>00:35:44.839 development over time the interest rate  <br>00:35:47.079 is usually fixed Y and they M them once  <br>00:35:49.280 that that Bond matures everybody gets  <br>00:35:50.839 their money out I think everyone  <br>00:35:52.920 understands that simply essentially is a  <br>00:35:54.640 loan okay someone's making a loan to  <br>00:35:56.599 somebody at a fixed rate of interest and  <br>00:35:58.240 the person that's making the loan isn't  <br>00:35:59.480 going to lend the money themselves  <br>00:36:00.480 they're going to let everybody else come  <br>00:36:01.520 in and be part of that lending that  <br>00:36:03.200 amount of money being lent so everyone  <br>00:36:04.920 can share in that return correct okay so  <br>00:36:07.040 it could be a Government Bond could be a  <br>00:36:08.319 corporate bond okay so what's a data  <br>00:36:10.560 Bond exactly the same thing so the  <br>00:36:12.760 government says do you know what we need  <br>00:36:14.400 some data to do something maybe the data  <br>00:36:16.640 is important to understand an area in  <br>00:36:19.000 Dubai that people may have that data or  <br>00:36:21.280 maybe they're trying to build something  <br>00:36:22.319 to do with house and they're trying to  <br>00:36:24.240 the impact of cocoa pops who knows  <br>00:36:28.200 or maybe it's a research company trying  <br>00:36:29.800 to build you know some medication m and  <br>00:36:32.319 they need they need the data of people  <br>00:36:33.800 they can't get today people may have a  <br>00:36:35.400 unique allergies or certain things  <br>00:36:37.200 because take covid right even though the  <br>00:36:39.119 the medication was heavily tested  <br>00:36:41.240 there's always going to be outliers  <br>00:36:42.920 because you just don't have enough  <br>00:36:44.359 testing data to prove but could you  <br>00:36:46.800 issue a bond to say actually instead of  <br>00:36:49.319 trying to take this data from people why  <br>00:36:51.400 don't you contribute and every time and  <br>00:36:53.839 then every as we're building this you  <br>00:36:55.240 will get rewarded every time your data  <br>00:36:56.599 is used this is why it's so cool in a  <br>00:36:59.560 bond I get paid once because it's only  <br>00:37:01.680 for the property but that same data  <br>00:37:03.200 could get used seven times or more or  <br>00:37:05.839 more which means I get rewarded every  <br>00:37:08.000 time and the government could even take  <br>00:37:09.839 a clip of that take some money off that  <br>00:37:11.839 as a as a as a revenue generator so the  <br>00:37:14.400 government's making money government's  <br>00:37:15.960 getting data they need and everybody  <br>00:37:17.480 else is getting rewarded at the same  <br>00:37:18.680 time how is that data for for the  <br>00:37:21.760 average Joe guy goes to work every day  <br>00:37:23.640 works at KPMG just become partner wife  <br>00:37:25.920 works as I don't know whatever another  <br>00:37:28.000 business she's an accountant let's say  <br>00:37:29.319 as well and they live a normal life they  <br>00:37:31.839 got two kids they live in Arabian  <br>00:37:33.200 ranches or wherever it may be they they  <br>00:37:34.839 a very normal life how does that that  <br>00:37:37.160 man that's sitting listening to this  <br>00:37:38.640 right now going holy macaroni this  <br>00:37:40.640 sounds cool how does he then consciously  <br>00:37:43.839 is he able to harvest and harness his  <br>00:37:46.400 own data so he will today is going be  <br>00:37:49.520 difficult right let's be H let's be  <br>00:37:50.520 honest there'll be certain data that he  <br>00:37:51.760 can't get if we use the examples of  <br>00:37:53.640 government with healths that's a lot  <br>00:37:55.720 desperate today there may be some things  <br>00:37:57.800 though that on your Apple watch and  <br>00:37:59.000 device you can be able to get yourself  <br>00:38:01.319 um could be your step count could be  <br>00:38:02.880 your heart rate or anything that makes  <br>00:38:04.200 you unique that could easily be given  <br>00:38:06.480 today um and all it would take is a is a  <br>00:38:09.240 bank to issue a bond I think in Dubai  <br>00:38:10.920 they've just done social bonds um  <br>00:38:13.119 there's no reason why you couldn't do  <br>00:38:14.119 one for data um so what it starts to do  <br>00:38:17.720 is starts and this is why I hope this  <br>00:38:19.680 happens with people listening they start  <br>00:38:22.040 looking at the data and questioning what  <br>00:38:23.640 that data means and is it valuable and  <br>00:38:26.000 more importantly is it valuable to them  <br>00:38:28.560 before but is it is it not a case of of  <br>00:38:30.880 some  <br>00:38:32.040 people will listen to this and go yeah  <br>00:38:34.280 this is really valuable but I don't even  <br>00:38:36.160 know where to start where where is where  <br>00:38:37.839 is my data you  <br>00:38:39.520 know and it may be this is the infancy  <br>00:38:42.160 and that's what you're bringing bringing  <br>00:38:43.319 to the world but but you know as we can  <br>00:38:47.800 clearly currently we can store our  <br>00:38:49.880 cryptocurrency on an exchange or we can  <br>00:38:51.680 store in a store in a cold wallet right  <br>00:38:54.160 um and so we've got those two options so  <br>00:38:56.920 for those people people that don't know  <br>00:38:57.880 what a cold storage is just think of a  <br>00:38:59.560 USB stick it's like it's the easiest way  <br>00:39:01.319 to describe it you put it on a USB stick  <br>00:39:02.960 and you put the USB in your pocket  <br>00:39:05.440 so for for those people wanting to be  <br>00:39:08.200 able to to harness it there will come a  <br>00:39:11.040 time in the not too dist future where  <br>00:39:12.800 they can literally every piece of data  <br>00:39:15.440 that they produce can be collected in an  <br>00:39:17.680 automated fashion and go into their  <br>00:39:20.520 storage facility of that and that's when  <br>00:39:23.480 they're going to have the power over it  <br>00:39:24.960 there'll be companies so there are  <br>00:39:26.800 companies that exist already so this is  <br>00:39:29.040 not like the fantasy of someone writing  <br>00:39:30.760 this the cool bit is I get the chance to  <br>00:39:32.200 work with people doing it yeah so  <br>00:39:33.760 there's a company I work with in silic  <br>00:39:35.359 and Valley who are building a data  <br>00:39:36.520 wallet where basically you'll be able to  <br>00:39:38.680 do exactly what I've just described they  <br>00:39:40.119 launch pretty soon where you'll be able  <br>00:39:41.960 to store your data and have a savings uh  <br>00:39:44.800 product capturing the rewards and value  <br>00:39:47.160 from your data um there are already  <br>00:39:49.400 companies on the internet where you can  <br>00:39:50.920 pull all your data together in a  <br>00:39:52.480 community mhm and every time that data  <br>00:39:54.680 is sold you get rewarded every time that  <br>00:39:56.880 data is used us so they could pull that  <br>00:39:58.720 data together and maybe sell it on like  <br>00:40:00.960 an app store or something like that a  <br>00:40:02.280 Marketplace that people would be  <br>00:40:03.280 familiar with they already exist by the  <br>00:40:05.599 by the way ex that like a Cooperative  <br>00:40:07.280 basically exactly exactly that so those  <br>00:40:09.680 exist today there's wallets that exist  <br>00:40:11.280 today there are companies in Saudi  <br>00:40:13.160 Arabia building what I'm describing for  <br>00:40:16.119 health um where people can actually  <br>00:40:17.920 manage their own health data and do that  <br>00:40:20.160 um there are already other companies in  <br>00:40:21.760 web 3 world which allow people to take  <br>00:40:23.680 their data that they store on the  <br>00:40:24.640 internet there's even browsers today  <br>00:40:25.920 like Brave and others that tell you and  <br>00:40:28.160 block advertising if you to look after  <br>00:40:30.319 your data so this is emerging and the  <br>00:40:32.560 biggest move that happened last year  <br>00:40:34.160 which listeners will not know is that  <br>00:40:36.440 Brazil is the first country in the world  <br>00:40:37.960 to allow its citizens to monetize their  <br>00:40:39.520 own data good old Brazil we love Brazil  <br>00:40:42.599 lived in Brazil for a few years there  <br>00:40:44.000 you go why the F Brazil um because they  <br>00:40:47.200 built the technology why if Brazil a  <br>00:40:49.839 developing country as big as it is  <br>00:40:52.040 Amazon covering a big chunk of it why it  <br>00:40:55.800 is crazy so over the last five years I'd  <br>00:40:59.359 say they've gone on a massive  <br>00:41:01.079 digitization Journey um I'm not sure if  <br>00:41:03.760 your listeners will be aware of the Pix  <br>00:41:04.920 network but it's a it's a competitive  <br>00:41:07.079 Network to the traditional payment  <br>00:41:08.680 companies but it's digital so the the  <br>00:41:11.280 fees are a lot cheaper but it makes it  <br>00:41:13.160 more accessible to everyone so they're  <br>00:41:15.079 almost using those digital rails now to  <br>00:41:17.240 eventually push tokens across them so  <br>00:41:19.400 now I've got a digital rail that means I  <br>00:41:20.760 can put any type of payment across it  <br>00:41:22.640 whether it be data whether it be Bitcoin  <br>00:41:24.160 it doesn't really matter um so now  <br>00:41:26.520 they've moved on to this level well  <br>00:41:28.160 actually isn't it time that our citizens  <br>00:41:30.359 got rewarded for how their data is being  <br>00:41:32.200 used um so that was literally written  <br>00:41:34.319 almost written into law last year this  <br>00:41:35.640 year so there's going for consultation  <br>00:41:37.839 and then once that becomes law again  <br>00:41:39.720 that could be a reference point for the  <br>00:41:41.000 rest of the world to say well hang on  <br>00:41:43.680 looks like things are changing and this  <br>00:41:45.160 is why you'll see these companies like  <br>00:41:46.880 even when I started writing my book  <br>00:41:48.720 there was no one it's taking me that  <br>00:41:50.960 long there's like now 30 40 people I  <br>00:41:53.359 meet all over the world I met people  <br>00:41:54.839 last week who are doing blockchain for  <br>00:41:56.920 health care in the United Kingdom MH  <br>00:41:58.920 they're working with patients and  <br>00:42:00.400 they're working with hospitals so they  <br>00:42:02.040 share data with patients and they also  <br>00:42:03.839 make money from that data so this is  <br>00:42:06.280 happening right now um and that's why  <br>00:42:08.760 this is exciting for me  <br>00:42:10.640 because it won't be the monetization  <br>00:42:12.880 that's the exciting bit is the things  <br>00:42:14.160 that we've talked about which is the  <br>00:42:15.520 prevention the ability to create your  <br>00:42:17.640 own mini programs to manage your health  <br>00:42:19.720 to manage your Finance you know talk  <br>00:42:21.680 about utilities that would excite your  <br>00:42:23.240 audience today not many people can  <br>00:42:25.760 understand Financial products mhm um  <br>00:42:28.000 because unfortunately that's a problem  <br>00:42:29.480 for the banking system because they just  <br>00:42:31.280 push their products to customers and  <br>00:42:32.640 hope they understand U not all banks do  <br>00:42:35.040 that but when you on your own data and  <br>00:42:37.359 you have an AI all of a sudden now that  <br>00:42:39.400 will then tailor what it tells you based  <br>00:42:41.079 on your level of understanding and  <br>00:42:42.720 learning so imagine hold on a minute  <br>00:42:44.720 let's just let's do that another way so  <br>00:42:46.760 everyone can get that because that's big  <br>00:42:48.520 yeah say that again so imagine today I  <br>00:42:51.960 have a mortgage and I'm given a leaflet  <br>00:42:54.599 that explains the mortgage to me uhuh  <br>00:42:56.680 everybody's understand that differently  <br>00:42:58.119 based on their literacy level yeah some  <br>00:43:00.000 people just won't get it yeah but what  <br>00:43:02.040 if your AI knew your educational history  <br>00:43:05.760 all your experience all your data and  <br>00:43:08.319 then suddenly interpreted that mortgage  <br>00:43:10.119 into a way that you  <br>00:43:14.839 understood that's the point in all this  <br>00:43:16.800 we have collected a lifetime worth of  <br>00:43:19.000 data and it tells everything about our  <br>00:43:21.440 past it tells us everything who we are  <br>00:43:24.200 but it also tells us who we could become  <br>00:43:26.880 and that's really the power when you  <br>00:43:28.040 start connecting all of this stuff  <br>00:43:30.119 because there is so much we've lost  <br>00:43:33.200 because it's been deleted but there's so  <br>00:43:35.079 much that we could gain because we can't  <br>00:43:36.839 get at it if we could get at it and  <br>00:43:39.440 connect it we could do so much more and  <br>00:43:42.280 what is making this conversation  <br>00:43:44.079 possible today is because the irony is  <br>00:43:46.599 all these technologies have come  <br>00:43:47.920 together at the same time and our  <br>00:43:49.880 maturity as a population of acceptance  <br>00:43:52.200 of technology is a lot higher than it  <br>00:43:53.760 was talk to me about the bit being  <br>00:43:56.599 deleted data being lost that will um I  <br>00:43:59.920 me I there was a guy in the office that  <br>00:44:01.440 came to me the other day and he said  <br>00:44:02.480 I've just got myself a new phone he said  <br>00:44:03.880 I've just lost 20 years of WhatsApp  <br>00:44:05.480 messages I'm like I'm not sure you had  <br>00:44:06.839 WhatsApp for 20 years but nonetheless  <br>00:44:08.520 said he said I said and he's got one  <br>00:44:10.480 Samsung phone to another I said well  <br>00:44:11.839 you've got your Samsung account you can  <br>00:44:13.200 find it no it's gone it's gone it's gone  <br>00:44:15.960 and I was like well you know what that  <br>00:44:17.160 might be a fresh  <br>00:44:18.760 start cuz if you got 20 years of  <br>00:44:20.880 messages on your phone then what kind of  <br>00:44:22.880 a life are you living but that aside he  <br>00:44:26.160 he then said to me but you don't realize  <br>00:44:28.000 he said there's all kinds of clients and  <br>00:44:30.720 leads and opportunities and Business  <br>00:44:32.760 Development chances that now I've lost  <br>00:44:34.880 and I won't be able to remember so  <br>00:44:37.400 that's that's that's that's a normal guy  <br>00:44:39.240 losing his data on his WhatsApp give me  <br>00:44:41.480 give me your explanation  <br>00:44:43.800 so he's correct obviously his timeline's  <br>00:44:46.440 not quite accurate um but he is correct  <br>00:44:49.960 so but the important thing that people  <br>00:44:51.520 need to realize is data is now a  <br>00:44:52.839 cultural artifact as well it's a record  <br>00:44:55.680 of who we were um 14 million people year  <br>00:44:58.400 ago to the pyramids of Egypt yeah right  <br>00:45:00.520 there's a reason for that because  <br>00:45:01.720 they're trying to understand the stories  <br>00:45:02.920 of the past that's where they go um data  <br>00:45:06.720 now has become a cultural artifact but  <br>00:45:08.480 we don't treat it as such so from 1991  <br>00:45:11.359 to 1995 the internet was never archived  <br>00:45:14.359 there's very little record of the  <br>00:45:15.880 internet from 1991 to 1995 okay 2009 and  <br>00:45:20.079 I we're showing our age right 2009 to  <br>00:45:22.160 2018 was the year of the geoc Cities the  <br>00:45:24.800 Myspace these big dominant um websites  <br>00:45:27.920 right where people used to write their  <br>00:45:29.079 music put their you know a lot of  <br>00:45:30.920 artists were discovered on my St B right  <br>00:45:33.599 um and you also got songs music stories  <br>00:45:36.200 everything blogs um all  <br>00:45:38.440 deleted on mypace Geo CI doesn't exist  <br>00:45:41.359 anymore it's been deleted Gio Ci's gone  <br>00:45:43.880 Myspace gone every piece of information  <br>00:45:47.599 that was on there downloaded uploaded  <br>00:45:49.280 Sorry by everybody je cities was wiped  <br>00:45:51.559 35 million users were gone so if you add  <br>00:45:55.359 up all of the websites that were deleted  <br>00:45:57.520 between 2009 and 2018 just to bring this  <br>00:46:00.559 to life for your audience that's the  <br>00:46:02.480 equivalent of me standing in front of  <br>00:46:03.839 the New York library and hitting delete  <br>00:46:05.119 and wiping it off the face of the earth  <br>00:46:07.480 that is half the Vatican archives being  <br>00:46:09.640 deleted that's what that means during  <br>00:46:12.480 covid the my understanding is that the  <br>00:46:15.480 British Museum and archives struggled to  <br>00:46:17.400 piece Co  <br>00:46:18.640 together because our data is constantly  <br>00:46:21.000 being deleted because it's not in our  <br>00:46:23.079 control um and also let's go back to  <br>00:46:26.240 WhatsApp as well  <br>00:46:27.839 let to make your audience think a little  <br>00:46:29.119 bit so I'm going to show My Age Again um  <br>00:46:31.720 again this demonstrates our lack of  <br>00:46:32.920 can't sit in my studio I know I'm you  <br>00:46:35.040 like you do shave like you're in a  <br>00:46:37.640 bloody boy bad talk to people about your  <br>00:46:39.720 age I know you're about 25 just want to  <br>00:46:42.359 shave um right so let's talk about this  <br>00:46:45.720 so if I talk about um if where we going  <br>00:46:49.040 with this so there's the cultural  <br>00:46:50.760 component yeah and then there's also was  <br>00:46:53.359 what was I saying WhatsApp WhatsApp yeah  <br>00:46:54.839 let's go back to WhatsApp so when we  <br>00:46:56.359 think of WhatsApp today let's go back to  <br>00:46:58.319 maybe I think it was the early 2000s  <br>00:47:00.280 Rupert Murdo tried to buy  <br>00:47:02.079 Sky he was told no he went through the  <br>00:47:05.119 competition Authority they said you  <br>00:47:06.400 can't do this because you will have the  <br>00:47:07.520 Monopoly on news Fair many years later  <br>00:47:11.880 Facebook buys WhatsApp and Instagram my  <br>00:47:14.400 argument is it's the same thing they now  <br>00:47:16.720 control the news and they control  <br>00:47:18.240 communication this is a a  <br>00:47:20.359 misunderstanding of not only the  <br>00:47:21.880 cultural example I give in terms of well  <br>00:47:24.040 we don't really understand the think of  <br>00:47:25.160 data as culture MH we also don't think  <br>00:47:27.440 of data and the companies that manage it  <br>00:47:29.319 as a form of communication and news so  <br>00:47:31.599 it's also a regulatory Gap when so the  <br>00:47:34.640 lot of the laws that exist today around  <br>00:47:36.559 merges and Acquisitions and competition  <br>00:47:38.680 they don't actually look at why these  <br>00:47:40.559 companies are buying these technology  <br>00:47:42.880 companies today they're not buying them  <br>00:47:44.680 for other than yes the technology but  <br>00:47:47.240 also the data that they can generate and  <br>00:47:48.920 they have so we are missing a lot of  <br>00:47:52.400 things that are on the surface not  <br>00:47:54.240 obvious so there's the data C culture  <br>00:47:56.680 there's there's the data merger and  <br>00:47:57.839 acquisition there's the data utilization  <br>00:48:00.440 we don't see all of these things have  <br>00:48:02.280 been going on for decades it's just the  <br>00:48:04.480 fact that AI has exposed them to us is  <br>00:48:06.920 there many people like you out there  <br>00:48:08.559 that are really excited about this  <br>00:48:10.400 subject matter that you spend time with  <br>00:48:12.559 talking to or is it or is it still very  <br>00:48:17.280 very early no it's so it's interesting  <br>00:48:20.119 it's almost like you bump into people  <br>00:48:22.280 like the universe wants you to meet them  <br>00:48:24.319 so I I I tend to bump into people at  <br>00:48:26.359 event saw through the network so I met  <br>00:48:30.040 the guy from the data wallet through a  <br>00:48:31.440 well-known person and you know he was  <br>00:48:33.599 like me to my brother right he was  <br>00:48:34.839 literally not only talking about a piece  <br>00:48:36.960 of what I'm talking about like he was  <br>00:48:38.200 building it and he could show me bits of  <br>00:48:40.160 it um and he was involved in the  <br>00:48:41.960 Brazilian regulation um and then i' met  <br>00:48:44.559 someone recently who's building all the  <br>00:48:45.960 health stuff so the cool thing is I'm  <br>00:48:48.760 meeting lots of people who are building  <br>00:48:51.520 in the book The Puzzle that I'm  <br>00:48:53.880 describing and we're describing is being  <br>00:48:55.640 built um that's exciting bit so now now  <br>00:48:59.240 my argument is always the same now we've  <br>00:49:00.720 got the tools we just need the will we  <br>00:49:02.680 need to change the way and that's part  <br>00:49:04.280 of you know what I'm doing and others  <br>00:49:06.040 like me are doing and part of the the  <br>00:49:07.760 work we're doing to help businesses and  <br>00:49:10.000 governments rethink this really  <br>00:49:12.520 important asset that's going to become  <br>00:49:14.680 crucial because there's also the people  <br>00:49:16.880 component in this that I think we' lost  <br>00:49:18.440 as well um which I think they will  <br>00:49:21.000 become even more important with AI Than  <br>00:49:22.599 People realize I think particularly with  <br>00:49:23.960 data interesting now your book is out  <br>00:49:27.119 when so this te is taking longer than I  <br>00:49:29.440 thought and that's cuz the world doesn't  <br>00:49:31.359 stop so 2025 so early 2025 is the plan  <br>00:49:35.079 and the name of the book uh data  <br>00:49:36.520 Revolution the rise of an asset data  <br>00:49:38.920 Revolution the rise of an asset will you  <br>00:49:40.480 do it for us in audio form as well for  <br>00:49:42.480 people that 100% um So the plan is to do  <br>00:49:45.000 two things actually so the first part of  <br>00:49:46.440 the book is a voice for a generation to  <br>00:49:48.799 demand change is to show them what data  <br>00:49:51.599 is and what it became and how it changed  <br>00:49:53.440 and what we Mis outed on but also what  <br>00:49:55.240 could be um this is not sad story um and  <br>00:49:58.359 then we show them the model to make this  <br>00:50:00.119 work so you've asked all the right  <br>00:50:02.079 questions today um and that's why I  <br>00:50:04.200 didn't want to leave people hanging and  <br>00:50:05.799 go well okay this is a great book about  <br>00:50:07.240 history what does this mean because I  <br>00:50:08.440 think the talking is over we need  <br>00:50:09.760 direction now so the second part of the  <br>00:50:11.760 book is the guide book on how to do it  <br>00:50:13.680 so the regulation the model that makes  <br>00:50:15.440 it work all the things that you've asked  <br>00:50:17.000 me about today will be in there even new  <br>00:50:19.079 curriculums for school even the way the  <br>00:50:21.079 businesses need to think about hiring  <br>00:50:22.440 people and all the skills that they're  <br>00:50:23.680 going to be needing to make all of this  <br>00:50:25.359 work if you if you if you've got kids at  <br>00:50:27.799 school and they're seven or eight years  <br>00:50:30.160 old this this is essentially essentially  <br>00:50:33.720 this is essential as a subject matter  <br>00:50:35.760 for them to learn oh 100% because I I  <br>00:50:38.160 think it's a combination of data and AI  <br>00:50:40.559 so we're seeing a lot of conversation  <br>00:50:43.160 around curriculums for AI and teaching  <br>00:50:45.359 kids I'm seeing nothing about data and I  <br>00:50:47.880 think the two go hand inand um I will  <br>00:50:50.799 guarantee something in in three four  <br>00:50:52.319 years time the skills and experiences  <br>00:50:54.720 that people bring to a business or  <br>00:50:56.160 people have in their own life will  <br>00:50:58.040 become incredibly valuable to businesses  <br>00:50:59.760 to the point where and I'll show in the  <br>00:51:01.160 book how you can start valuing people's  <br>00:51:03.119 skills because it's those skills are  <br>00:51:05.319 going to be important to read what AI  <br>00:51:07.599 says but also give the data that AI  <br>00:51:10.040 needs because they're going to come from  <br>00:51:11.680 people right absolutely okay three tips  <br>00:51:14.960 you can give the man on the street  <br>00:51:17.319 related to his data that he can sit and  <br>00:51:20.720 and be highly aware of now and get him  <br>00:51:23.280 into a really conscious state so I think  <br>00:51:25.440 the first thing is have a think about  <br>00:51:28.160 how much data you use every day and what  <br>00:51:30.200 do you use it for and second is who are  <br>00:51:32.599 you giving that data away to and are  <br>00:51:35.240 there ways that you can maybe stop that  <br>00:51:37.280 because there are tools on apps that  <br>00:51:38.400 allow you to do it um and there's also  <br>00:51:40.480 other technologies that you can find on  <br>00:51:41.920 the web that may help you get the most  <br>00:51:43.119 from it I think the third thing is the  <br>00:51:45.400 most important is start thinking about  <br>00:51:47.720 how you can use that data in your own  <br>00:51:49.160 life to make it better um like I work  <br>00:51:52.119 with my PT constantly and we're using  <br>00:51:53.880 data to improve my performance or even  <br>00:51:56.599 just simple things like I use data to  <br>00:51:57.960 cure my own health um so start looking  <br>00:52:01.480 at these things as tools so you know be  <br>00:52:04.200 careful who you give it to understand  <br>00:52:05.520 what you're giving but more importantly  <br>00:52:07.119 start to build an understanding how you  <br>00:52:08.559 can use it for yourself in ways other  <br>00:52:10.640 than just making money and I guess  <br>00:52:12.240 there's a fourth one which is look  <br>00:52:13.960 beyond the technology and don't be  <br>00:52:15.359 afraid about AI because actually once  <br>00:52:17.640 you start understanding your data and  <br>00:52:19.119 you can actually understand how to read  <br>00:52:20.359 it AI starts to become really useful  <br>00:52:22.359 then because it's not really about then  <br>00:52:24.040 as taking their jobs it's about working  <br>00:52:25.880 with AI  <br>00:52:27.160 to understand these predictive things  <br>00:52:28.880 that we've been talking about incredibly  <br>00:52:31.040 value Michael God thank you enough for  <br>00:52:33.160 coming and sharing this wisdom with us  <br>00:52:34.680 today it's been fantastic talking to you  <br>00:52:36.319 thank you so much for joining us no  <br>00:52:37.640 thanks for having me it's been amazing|## SUMMARY  <br>Futurist

much  <br>00:02:06.640 for coming on the show I wanted to do  <br>00:02:08.360 this interview for ages so I really  <br>00:02:09.919 appreciate your time today delighted to  <br>00:02:11.560 be here ready to go I've got to know you  <br>00:02:14.000 over the course of the last few months  <br>00:02:15.879 and been fascinated by your story what  <br>00:02:18.920 you do as a businessman how you live  <br>00:02:20.920 your life and the philosophies that you  <br>00:02:23.440 follow and for me trying to partner up  <br>00:02:27.879 some of the ways that you do business  <br>00:02:29.959 along with how you think okay and how  <br>00:02:31.680 you operate as a human being is  <br>00:02:33.040 something that I've really wanted to try  <br>00:02:34.319 and get to the bottom of and learn about  <br>00:02:36.480 for my own benefit but also with  <br>00:02:38.560 everybody that consumes this content and  <br>00:02:40.239 this podcast I want really people to  <br>00:02:41.840 take some real valuable lessons for this  <br>00:02:43.519 today so first of all let's just start  <br>00:02:46.080 off with a bit of a background on on  <br>00:02:47.519 your business okay and your business  <br>00:02:49.599 career so we can give people some  <br>00:02:50.879 context and then we're going to dive  <br>00:02:52.000 into a few other areas and then  <br>00:02:53.280 hopefully we'll just patch it all up  <br>00:02:54.680 together and people will see why you are  <br>00:02:57.040 who you are and why you do what you do  <br>00:02:59.360 okay well I started I studied uh primary  <br>00:03:02.640 Business Degree with French business  <br>00:03:04.440 process or engineering so I was always  <br>00:03:05.959 kind of process-led but not technology  <br>00:03:08.400 was all strategy uh you couldn't do that  <br>00:03:11.440 uh without embracing technology and very  <br>00:03:14.400 very early on like 1995 96 I got  <br>00:03:17.560 introduced to the internet and I was  <br>00:03:19.560 actually working in IBM at the time in  <br>00:03:21.120 Dublin and I was basically still a  <br>00:03:23.400 student and I remember just thinking wow  <br>00:03:25.120 this is this has got reached this has  <br>00:03:27.159 got benefit so I kind of decided to take  <br>00:03:30.040 my career on on on that as a medium and  <br>00:03:32.840 so I started by understanding the  <br>00:03:35.159 mathematics behind building networks  <br>00:03:36.879 tcpip and so on which my brain really  <br>00:03:39.239 only started working in college so then  <br>00:03:41.080 things made sense to me in terms of how  <br>00:03:42.519 you map things out and uh then I started  <br>00:03:45.159 lecturing on that started talking about  <br>00:03:46.560 it and teaching people and bringing  <br>00:03:48.159 people along and started getting  <br>00:03:50.400 insights into how people receive  <br>00:03:52.720 information because you know you're  <br>00:03:54.239 there lecturing on these pretty tough  <br>00:03:56.319 topics but you're saying the same thing  <br>00:03:58.599 week after week uh but you see them  <br>00:04:00.640 taking it in for the first time or not  <br>00:04:02.239 taking it in and it it teaches you a lot  <br>00:04:04.480 about how people absorb information how  <br>00:04:07.200 they bounces off them sometimes and  <br>00:04:08.720 things like that because to you it's  <br>00:04:10.480 autopilot so you can focus on them  <br>00:04:12.640 rather than what's coming out of your  <br>00:04:14.239 mouth you know it inside out and uh so  <br>00:04:16.160 that was really interesting and that  <br>00:04:17.720 kind of led me to to a lot of  <br>00:04:19.639 realizations  <br>00:04:21.040 about tech and people because you got  <br>00:04:23.759 people who they wanted to look good in  <br>00:04:25.360 their jobs they were good at marketing  <br>00:04:26.960 or something else and then suddenly  <br>00:04:28.400 there's this internet thing that they  <br>00:04:29.720 they have to understand I wasn't a  <br>00:04:32.199 techie I couldn't go deep on this stuff  <br>00:04:34.000 I I but I started working with people  <br>00:04:35.960 who could and I kind of made a career  <br>00:04:37.960 for myself out of being in that bridge  <br>00:04:40.160 between the human problem and and  <br>00:04:43.360 technology so then I got into uh  <br>00:04:46.880 internet development companies from  <br>00:04:48.520 there and then in 2002 I started my  <br>00:04:51.360 first startup I actually moved home to  <br>00:04:53.440 my parents uh house went up to the attic  <br>00:04:56.360 rolled out a carpet and made a deal with  <br>00:04:58.120 them and said look I I'm using my  <br>00:04:59.680 apartment savings to pay for other staff  <br>00:05:02.080 but um if I can work here I'll just make  <br>00:05:05.039 sure there's always good wine in the  <br>00:05:06.160 fridge and we shook hands on that and  <br>00:05:07.680 that was it I started there then I moved  <br>00:05:10.360 to my first office because I could I  <br>00:05:12.880 could pay a monthly rent first so I  <br>00:05:14.479 didn't have to commit to a long-term  <br>00:05:15.919 lease and that was above a shop and that  <br>00:05:18.160 was disastrous because the boardroom we  <br>00:05:20.880 had I I had bought a a table in a  <br>00:05:24.080 liquidation sale from an old friend of  <br>00:05:25.800 mine which was huge and in our front  <br>00:05:29.120 room which was a converted bedroom or  <br>00:05:30.800 boardroom as we call it if there's more  <br>00:05:32.639 than five people in the room the floor  <br>00:05:34.199 started to give so if a client arrived  <br>00:05:36.520 with more than two people with I might  <br>00:05:37.919 have to say to one of my staff go out  <br>00:05:39.400 the back door I'll tell them you're sick  <br>00:05:40.680 because we couldn't admit that the floor  <br>00:05:41.919 was caving in and we only had one you  <br>00:05:44.960 there was about a 12we lead time for an  <br>00:05:46.880 internet cable for ISDN it's 128  <br>00:05:50.039 kilobyte so we had one phone cable there  <br>00:05:52.800 was six staff one phone cable and uh the  <br>00:05:55.560 debate every day was who's got the  <br>00:05:57.039 internet so we were a web agency  <br>00:05:59.080 pitching for these these large  <br>00:06:00.800 contracts and uh we'd have debates every  <br>00:06:03.080 day why do you need the internet today  <br>00:06:04.479 and you like why you get this proposal  <br>00:06:06.160 at your client why do you need it and  <br>00:06:07.840 the tech you like if I don't start  <br>00:06:08.960 uploading the website today it won't be  <br>00:06:10.880 there by 8:00 in the morning okay you  <br>00:06:13.319 win so that was a Continuum that was my  <br>00:06:15.880 first startup and uh I'd call it  <br>00:06:18.199 Continuum because I wanted an ongoing  <br>00:06:20.080 relationship with with uh customers it  <br>00:06:22.919 started as being Continuum Technologies  <br>00:06:24.520 but the Technologies word aged really  <br>00:06:26.960 really quickly so I very quickly pivoted  <br>00:06:29.240 to kind of make it about people and uh  <br>00:06:31.599 we did very well we grew up and then and  <br>00:06:33.639 then in 2015 I overleveraged myself and  <br>00:06:36.560 then broke that out into a group so we  <br>00:06:38.680 had uh a lot more opportunities for  <br>00:06:41.080 growth there because people were coming  <br>00:06:42.800 to agencies saying I need a thing built  <br>00:06:44.720 I've got this budget this time scale and  <br>00:06:46.720 it has to do the following and I really  <br>00:06:48.960 want to get ahead of that say well how  <br>00:06:51.360 did you make all those decisions how do  <br>00:06:52.599 you know they're the right decisions and  <br>00:06:54.199 they typically didn't have answers so  <br>00:06:56.360 then we went towards what was called  <br>00:06:58.000 digital transformation which was getting  <br>00:06:59.759 ahead of that and you'd go in and write  <br>00:07:02.000 the road map with them and keep more  <br>00:07:04.039 importantly get the benefit of the doubt  <br>00:07:05.639 from them that you know let's talk about  <br>00:07:08.240 the proposal before you decide selling  <br>00:07:10.479 this to North America is the plan you  <br>00:07:13.120 challenge that idea but what it also  <br>00:07:15.680 meant then is that suddenly you were  <br>00:07:17.039 influential on how they went to B  <br>00:07:19.280 business and then suddenly you were  <br>00:07:20.319 winning business by default so we could  <br>00:07:22.199 start much earlier than a lot of our  <br>00:07:23.680 competition and then we could end much  <br>00:07:25.680 further because then we went into cyber  <br>00:07:28.120 security we went into hosting we went  <br>00:07:29.840 into  <br>00:07:30.720 24/7 uh support so you couldn't have  <br>00:07:34.199 full-time Engineers all the time but we  <br>00:07:35.879 had Partnerships with places that had  <br>00:07:38.160 24-hour Network operating centers and  <br>00:07:40.120 you just hand them a run book after 5:30  <br>00:07:42.720 at night so you were able to then  <br>00:07:45.520 support your clients 247 for a lot  <br>00:07:47.319 cheaper than a lot of your competition  <br>00:07:49.319 and there was still an escalation  <br>00:07:50.919 process um but when we started I mean I  <br>00:07:53.639 had a one-page website that was an extr  <br>00:07:56.840 net it said please enter your your  <br>00:07:58.400 username and password to log in cuz it  <br>00:08:01.199 was completely bootstrapped right and no  <br>00:08:03.440 matter what you put in there it just  <br>00:08:04.680 came back with oh I'm sorry your  <br>00:08:06.120 username is incorrect please contact  <br>00:08:07.879 sales at this number for extra support  <br>00:08:10.319 which rang my mobile directly and I  <br>00:08:12.680 remember when I won my first big  <br>00:08:14.039 contract uh it was actually Nissan and  <br>00:08:16.720 uh I remember the guys asked me do we  <br>00:08:18.120 get access to your Swanky externet now I  <br>00:08:20.280 said no no no you get me fulltime you  <br>00:08:21.960 get all of our service so it you know it  <br>00:08:24.680 was it was a bit of a bit of that it was  <br>00:08:26.800 very very critical path um very much  <br>00:08:29.039 about um being very deliberate there's a  <br>00:08:31.520 word I overuse which is the word  <br>00:08:32.958 deliberate but it was it was about being  <br>00:08:34.719 very very specific and very deliberate  <br>00:08:36.360 both in terms of what you were doing  <br>00:08:38.360 more importantly what you weren't doing  <br>00:08:40.440 and uh you know the people that you went  <br>00:08:42.479 along with you know it's a it's a space  <br>00:08:44.720 where you have to admit very quickly I  <br>00:08:46.519 just don't understand that or I I know  <br>00:08:48.680 what to get out of that person or that  <br>00:08:50.320 Tech or that skill and and how to pull  <br>00:08:52.600 it together and as that evolved into a  <br>00:08:54.399 group and we started getting much bigger  <br>00:08:55.880 clients and much longer contracts and a  <br>00:08:57.920 lot more dependencies  <br>00:08:59.880 you know I remember being challenged One  <br>00:09:01.320 Day by a very large International firm  <br>00:09:03.000 the head of marketing and she said  <br>00:09:04.360 you're the guy I never meet again once I  <br>00:09:06.720 sign this contract and I said I'm the  <br>00:09:09.480 guy that's responsible to make sure you  <br>00:09:11.320 have the right people in front of you at  <br>00:09:12.560 the right time and if that doesn't  <br>00:09:14.360 happen then I'm the guy you call and she  <br>00:09:16.440 said fair enough and she signed a  <br>00:09:17.480 multiion contract on that and and that  <br>00:09:20.040 was kind of that was the approach um but  <br>00:09:22.480 it was you know hard yards I went  <br>00:09:24.600 through two recessions a pandemic uh and  <br>00:09:28.680 I built up into a group I sold U most  <br>00:09:31.680 Parts anything that had staff um I sold  <br>00:09:35.079 I was taking a break I had lost  <br>00:09:36.440 unfortunately one or two members of my  <br>00:09:37.680 family and just decided to take a break  <br>00:09:39.560 so sold all of that and kept the  <br>00:09:41.560 investment stuff which brings us up to  <br>00:09:45.200 2018 uh where I live now is continuous  <br>00:09:47.760 Ventures uh and how I'd started that was  <br>00:09:51.800 as a give back as a CS so we did lots of  <br>00:09:54.240 Charity websites and projects and I went  <br>00:09:56.160 to Africa for years I went to Chernobyl  <br>00:09:57.920 I went to all these places because I had  <br>00:09:59.839 that freedom you know the tech was going  <br>00:10:01.519 well the business was going well I was  <br>00:10:03.000 free and single I was just enjoying  <br>00:10:05.240 other things in life I played music I  <br>00:10:07.040 wrote all these things uh and it was  <br>00:10:09.440 nice it was very very fulfilling uh as  <br>00:10:11.760 part of that and you know to be honest  <br>00:10:13.839 I'd become a bit complacent about  <br>00:10:15.120 business it kind of ran itself and I was  <br>00:10:16.839 like okay well I can now do this in my  <br>00:10:18.959 sleep and now just es and flows with  <br>00:10:21.240 society and values and markets and so on  <br>00:10:24.240 so it's doing other things but one thing  <br>00:10:25.920 that I really got struck by was the  <br>00:10:28.320 amount of mistakes that's startups we're  <br>00:10:30.279 making and uh as our give back instead  <br>00:10:33.600 of doing all the charity stuff which is  <br>00:10:35.079 extremely important but I found that the  <br>00:10:37.519 ask never changed it was just we need  <br>00:10:39.320 more of the same we need more of the  <br>00:10:40.560 same More Money More investment we'd  <br>00:10:42.320 build websites extr Nets things like  <br>00:10:44.959 that for them just as a as a giveaway  <br>00:10:46.639 just best of luck with that and and you  <br>00:10:48.639 know it was very important work  <br>00:10:51.480 extremely important but it was a lot of  <br>00:10:53.079 the same and the biggest lesson it  <br>00:10:55.760 taught me was about you know I mean you  <br>00:10:58.360 focus on the power content for for your  <br>00:11:00.880 for your living for what we're doing  <br>00:11:02.320 right here but in agency world you kind  <br>00:11:04.839 of it's about the impact of the message  <br>00:11:06.639 for the customer or the customer's  <br>00:11:08.200 customer and so on but I remember we  <br>00:11:09.800 were doing a website for a kids  <br>00:11:11.240 orphanage and a a Content update update  <br>00:11:14.560 came up to the design team and they just  <br>00:11:17.200 said uh can you remove the pictures of  <br>00:11:18.959 those three girls because they've all  <br>00:11:20.120 passed away and they were all like 10 12  <br>00:11:22.079 years of age and the impact in the  <br>00:11:24.480 office I can still get the Goosebumps  <br>00:11:26.240 now it hit the place like a tsunami it  <br>00:11:28.639 was just this  <br>00:11:30.440 Frozen vacuum of feeling that they the  <br>00:11:34.079 impact of that for designers and  <br>00:11:35.880 developers there was tears there was  <br>00:11:37.279 everything and you get that a lot with  <br>00:11:40.000 you know charity projects some of your  <br>00:11:41.959 most calm and quiet staff could be ones  <br>00:11:45.279 that feel the most passionate about a  <br>00:11:47.720 particular cause or particular um you  <br>00:11:50.120 know charity or or proposal um but I  <br>00:11:53.839 just remember the uniformity of of of  <br>00:11:56.200 everyone's feelings and that I was just  <br>00:11:57.519 sudden like oh God this is this is  <br>00:11:58.959 really real it's not just web stuff so I  <br>00:12:02.240 decided after that it was one of those  <br>00:12:04.320 kind of moments I just thought I need  <br>00:12:06.440 this needs to be about real people how  <br>00:12:08.040 we help Society sh about real real  <br>00:12:10.279 people so what it did was every second  <br>00:12:12.600 Thursday because we built out a group  <br>00:12:14.120 with a lot of senior people um every  <br>00:12:16.639 second Thursday I would advise for free  <br>00:12:19.079 with startups and just put it out there  <br>00:12:21.160 you i' kind of grown up in business in  <br>00:12:22.760 Dublin was well known in business terms  <br>00:12:25.199 particularly in Internet terms in Dublin  <br>00:12:27.360 and so just put Linked In and things  <br>00:12:29.920 like that you know with a little bit of  <br>00:12:31.800 pre-qualification we'll look at some of  <br>00:12:33.519 these things and then again because I  <br>00:12:35.959 wouldn't understand it fully I'd pull in  <br>00:12:37.800 you know CTO or design or development or  <br>00:12:40.920 strategy and then this kind of formula  <br>00:12:43.399 was born  <br>00:12:45.000 where I could make these very senior  <br>00:12:47.240 people that were sunken cost to us I  <br>00:12:49.480 could make them available to these  <br>00:12:50.760 startups just to help them avoid the  <br>00:12:52.519 mistakes that I made you know they say  <br>00:12:54.440 an expert is somebody who's made every  <br>00:12:56.000 mistake in a focused area uh I was  <br>00:12:58.880 definitely an expert for making all  <br>00:13:01.000 those mistakes and it was great  <br>00:13:02.680 satisfaction in just helping them  <br>00:13:04.639 reverse out of situations that they'  <br>00:13:06.639 caught up you know every every company  <br>00:13:08.639 has challenges that to them is  <br>00:13:11.000 completely new but you start seeing it  <br>00:13:12.519 on a routine basis you're like oh i'  <br>00:13:14.399 just I'd caution you there or let's just  <br>00:13:16.920 have another look at that and you try  <br>00:13:18.279 and draw it out of them rather than tell  <br>00:13:19.959 them you know um the language you use is  <br>00:13:22.720 very important but I was used to dealing  <br>00:13:24.160 with super bright people far brighter  <br>00:13:26.079 than me I like being the dumbest guy in  <br>00:13:27.839 every room particularly the team I've  <br>00:13:29.440 recently uh built and uh so the language  <br>00:13:33.120 you use is kind of supportive but coxing  <br>00:13:35.079 you know you firm on topics not on  <br>00:13:36.720 people and things like that and uh and  <br>00:13:39.519 then you know when when you needed to be  <br>00:13:40.959 a bit stronger with them you could be  <br>00:13:42.480 and then that led to being chairman of  <br>00:13:44.240 one or two things and I personally  <br>00:13:45.639 invested in a few of these startups but  <br>00:13:48.519 the energy that came from these as I saw  <br>00:13:51.519 them kids I mean they weren't but they  <br>00:13:53.720 were kids and and uh excited  <br>00:13:57.079 entrepreneurs and first timers and and  <br>00:13:59.120 midtimes and all this kind of stuff it  <br>00:14:01.680 just reinvigorated me towards the  <br>00:14:03.519 strategy of business and the ABS and  <br>00:14:05.120 flows and you know my kind of best  <br>00:14:08.040 definition of an entrepreneur is is is  <br>00:14:10.199 somebody who creates unlimited results  <br>00:14:13.199 out of often limited to no means by use  <br>00:14:16.199 of their their focus their ability to  <br>00:14:18.399 harness Talent harness people and  <br>00:14:19.920 resources and opportunities around them  <br>00:14:21.639 to to see their purpose through and you  <br>00:14:24.519 just trying to put that into these guys  <br>00:14:26.399 or you know or Draw it out of them some  <br>00:14:27.959 of them are amazing but they can't talk  <br>00:14:30.560 to somebody they can they can explain  <br>00:14:32.680 the best mathematics in the world but  <br>00:14:34.320 you put them in a room with a pretty  <br>00:14:35.920 girl and they go red and stare at the  <br>00:14:38.040 floor you know everyone needed strength  <br>00:14:40.360 at different times but certainly the  <br>00:14:43.199 model for continuous Ventures was born  <br>00:14:45.240 out of that fact that apart from the  <br>00:14:47.040 advisory and the investment making very  <br>00:14:50.199 Senior People available to these  <br>00:14:51.680 startups so they're not burning their  <br>00:14:53.199 own cash all the time you see these  <br>00:14:54.720 startups they raise a million or two and  <br>00:14:57.360 then before you know they've hired  <br>00:14:58.440 people they don't how to use properly  <br>00:15:00.040 they're underutilized even from a time  <br>00:15:01.839 and cost point of view and they're  <br>00:15:03.600 burning cash and suddenly the pressure's  <br>00:15:05.279 on and they probably got a a bear of an  <br>00:15:07.600 investor sitting at the boardroom table  <br>00:15:09.199 tapping the  <br>00:15:10.519 table so we could just absorb that into  <br>00:15:13.000 our model and and then kind of  <br>00:15:14.680 facilitate the conduit for startups and  <br>00:15:17.199 that's what I do know  <br>00:15:19.959 wow let's talk about digital  <br>00:15:22.000 transformation because I think it's a  <br>00:15:24.399 term that's that's widely used that most  <br>00:15:27.480 people don't really understand so can  <br>00:15:29.120 you explain to me what it is and give me  <br>00:15:30.920 an  <br>00:15:31.600 example yes uh one of the things about  <br>00:15:34.000 digital transformation is defining what  <br>00:15:35.720 it isn't uh every company will say we  <br>00:15:38.199 want to be you know we want to do a  <br>00:15:40.360 digital transformation program and we're  <br>00:15:42.160 going to be the best in our field or  <br>00:15:43.519 we're going to be you know leading the  <br>00:15:45.480 market and so  <br>00:15:46.639 on companies want digital transformation  <br>00:15:49.199 until you try and change something and  <br>00:15:50.759 then they realize they just want digital  <br>00:15:52.360 efficiency they want it faster a little  <br>00:15:54.560 bit more accurate or better or shinier  <br>00:15:57.519 but when you say okay we're going to  <br>00:15:59.480 totally recalibrate how you do your  <br>00:16:01.079 business how you talk to your customer  <br>00:16:02.480 where you where your customer is or what  <br>00:16:03.920 channels you go to market or a big one  <br>00:16:06.959 is what do you do with your data do you  <br>00:16:09.360 you gather loads of data have you any  <br>00:16:11.079 insight on what that data  <br>00:16:12.959 is and then you try and you you try and  <br>00:16:15.560 recalibrate you try and change it find  <br>00:16:17.440 new rootes to Market an example I gave  <br>00:16:19.560 was you get the airline business they  <br>00:16:21.680 know you're flying from from Dublin to  <br>00:16:23.720 Dubai and you're flying you know at on  <br>00:16:26.240 this date you've booked it in a certain  <br>00:16:27.959 language you're your you know business  <br>00:16:30.319 or first or economy class you know what  <br>00:16:33.160 airport you're going to how long you're  <br>00:16:34.680 staying all of that  <br>00:16:36.199 data and the airline business started  <br>00:16:38.399 kind of transforming that to say okay  <br>00:16:40.120 well then we can start making  <br>00:16:41.319 assumptions and now it's done with more  <br>00:16:42.880 AI but it was more kind of digital  <br>00:16:45.319 suppositions before to say okay well  <br>00:16:47.800 you're traveling with two kids so you  <br>00:16:49.639 possibly need a car and you possibly  <br>00:16:51.440 need to return it on this day so here's  <br>00:16:52.920 a guest average of a three star level  <br>00:16:55.720 car at this price or three star level  <br>00:16:58.639 hot hotel or five star level Hotel  <br>00:17:00.680 depending on your profile and you know I  <br>00:17:03.920 I remember working on that a long long  <br>00:17:05.559 time ago for Rhino [hotels.com](http://hotels.com/) for  <br>00:17:07.799 example and they they in the first year  <br>00:17:10.000 they increased the revenue by 11% just  <br>00:17:12.079 by changing that one thing and that's a  <br>00:17:14.799 you know it's using your data to reach  <br>00:17:17.199 your customer in a in a deeper way not  <br>00:17:19.280 in a new way because you've already sold  <br>00:17:21.000 to them but now you're saying let's  <br>00:17:22.119 let's solve those problems for you as  <br>00:17:23.520 well and in this in the spirit of  <br>00:17:26.000 critical thinking and deliberate  <br>00:17:27.679 thinking it's it's how do you nail the  <br>00:17:30.679 job to be done you know and old elector  <br>00:17:32.760 mind you say that how do you nail the  <br>00:17:34.160 job to be done getting that one thing  <br>00:17:37.039 right that is a pain for a customer and  <br>00:17:39.679 you solve it and it's that thing of you  <br>00:17:41.600 don't buy a drill because you need a  <br>00:17:42.799 drill you buy a drill because you need a  <br>00:17:44.160 hole so so can can I maybe take an  <br>00:17:47.360 example within my business about how  <br>00:17:49.840 that would apply then so so one of my  <br>00:17:51.760 businesses is an insurance brokerage  <br>00:17:54.039 that insurance brokerage predominantly  <br>00:17:55.799 sells medical insurance okay now our  <br>00:17:58.559 client have other insurance needs but we  <br>00:18:01.039 predominantly focus on medical insurance  <br>00:18:03.799 but the buyer or the decision maker  <br>00:18:07.400 would be the HR Director followed by the  <br>00:18:11.080 CFO who would sign it off so HR Director  <br>00:18:13.080 does the leg work CFO signs it off make  <br>00:18:14.960 sure they've got the budget to do  <br>00:18:16.559 it we have a requirement to potentially  <br>00:18:19.919 Sell gratuiti Solutions to companies  <br>00:18:22.320 here the same decision maker is involved  <br>00:18:25.159 on a B2B basis really because the HR  <br>00:18:27.240 Director and the CFO are the ones that  <br>00:18:28.520 were the decisions about that kind of  <br>00:18:30.120 stuff so am why on the clock now am I am  <br>00:18:32.280 I  <br>00:18:34.360 good I just because I want I want to  <br>00:18:36.400 give everyone context if we could we we  <br>00:18:38.200 we could do it there because I think  <br>00:18:39.200 that was a b Toc model and and and  <br>00:18:41.440 because digital transformation I think  <br>00:18:42.799 would apply to B2B of course as well  <br>00:18:44.440 yeah yeah it's where most of the most of  <br>00:18:46.120 the work is so the work that you'd be  <br>00:18:47.960 doing is you potentially would be  <br>00:18:49.679 looking at that saying right you're  <br>00:18:50.720 sending to this type of customer this  <br>00:18:53.039 type of product or service what other  <br>00:18:54.880 the problems do they have and how can I  <br>00:18:57.600 solve other problems that they've got  <br>00:18:59.679 because they've already made a  <br>00:19:00.640 commitment to be a customer anyway and  <br>00:19:02.679 how can I do that in a more digitally  <br>00:19:05.039 effective process yeah in fact the the  <br>00:19:08.200 example you give is is a very  <br>00:19:09.919 interesting and easier one to solve  <br>00:19:12.080 although it's it's big pieces of work  <br>00:19:14.440 and the first thing you do is you know  <br>00:19:15.880 you say for example a HR Director um  <br>00:19:18.600 would be would be involved in in signing  <br>00:19:20.480 off on that for a company so  <br>00:19:22.760 particularly in Dubai you've got a legal  <br>00:19:24.200 requirement to provide certain levels of  <br>00:19:25.640 health insurance and so on and then  <br>00:19:26.919 depending on the profile of the staff  <br>00:19:28.400 you might at various  <br>00:19:30.000 levels so you got that but then you look  <br>00:19:32.960 at the problems that the HR Director or  <br>00:19:36.679 chief people officer has so actually up  <br>00:19:39.080 until recently and a client to  <br>00:19:40.280 continuous is a company called covis and  <br>00:19:42.480 they're like the Harvard Business review  <br>00:19:43.960 of strategy for chief people officers  <br>00:19:46.280 right so when the you know the chief  <br>00:19:48.320 people officer of Pepsi gets asked  <br>00:19:50.120 what's our working from home policy post  <br>00:19:52.080 pandemic they turn to academics to say  <br>00:19:55.120 well you know firstly prove it secondly  <br>00:19:57.720 give me a template for in that out  <br>00:19:59.320 across my staff across the world so if  <br>00:20:01.840 you look at that person's um profile and  <br>00:20:05.039 problem it's typically a mid toate uh  <br>00:20:08.039 director female and in in that role but  <br>00:20:12.280 then if you think of let's say her  <br>00:20:15.280 her uh customers and her customers are  <br>00:20:18.039 the staff so then you take anything that  <br>00:20:20.559 you're signing and passing through like  <br>00:20:22.240 Insurance whether it's medical insurance  <br>00:20:24.559 whether it's car insurance pet insurance  <br>00:20:26.159 doesn't matter that's solving a problem  <br>00:20:28.080 for her C customer who is the the staff  <br>00:20:30.240 member so then you follow the data down  <br>00:20:32.840 to them and you say okay well I've also  <br>00:20:34.559 noticed that you have a husband and  <br>00:20:36.440 husband is a separate policy someplace  <br>00:20:38.120 else okay so let's let's get efficient  <br>00:20:40.360 here about cross- selling and we'll  <br>00:20:41.919 offer a family discount that's the easy  <br>00:20:44.039 stuff okay but then you start saying  <br>00:20:46.159 okay how are we going to separate  <br>00:20:47.280 ourselves apart and this is really where  <br>00:20:48.840 digital transformation kicks in because  <br>00:20:50.440 you then say right we know from the  <br>00:20:53.480 profile of the staff that that person  <br>00:20:55.840 maybe the CFO of the same company is a  <br>00:20:58.280 50 year old man and you know he's always  <br>00:21:01.720 asking about Family Insurance  <br>00:21:03.240 particularly maybe insurance for his  <br>00:21:05.120 father or something and then you go down  <br>00:21:07.000 that rabbit hole and you say okay his  <br>00:21:09.240 father is Alzheimer's he's no power of  <br>00:21:11.600 attorney with his father's data you  <br>00:21:13.720 think of where that medical data sits  <br>00:21:15.559 does it sit in a hospital does it sit in  <br>00:21:17.400 his in his pocket has a bunch of  <br>00:21:18.960 doctor's notes and can you digitize that  <br>00:21:21.799 and if you can digitize that then you  <br>00:21:24.159 can you're your that person can be  <br>00:21:26.240 authorized to maybe make decisions for  <br>00:21:28.640 father about his medication renewing his  <br>00:21:30.880 prescriptions anything like that so  <br>00:21:32.600 you're solving very very personal  <br>00:21:34.720 problems for people you're doing it in a  <br>00:21:36.799 very data efficient way and you're  <br>00:21:39.480 you're kind of going down the rabbit  <br>00:21:40.880 hole of of every individual need and  <br>00:21:43.600 that's how you kind of get you know  <br>00:21:45.320 loyalty and stickiness with these  <br>00:21:46.799 Platforms in a world of a million apps  <br>00:21:49.200 right it's the ones that you know really  <br>00:21:51.919 channel the life blood of people's  <br>00:21:53.880 problems is where you'll find the money  <br>00:21:55.919 and they will say if you if you solve  <br>00:21:57.320 one problem a person has on a recurring  <br>00:21:59.400 basis you'll make a couple of million  <br>00:22:00.720 dollars in in in those apps but it's  <br>00:22:03.200 just in those processes the ability to  <br>00:22:05.799 breathe life into following the data and  <br>00:22:09.440 solving those problems for everybody so  <br>00:22:11.919 then you say okay we sell  <br>00:22:14.159 insurance but you can self tailor that  <br>00:22:16.960 insurance the company is paying for your  <br>00:22:18.559 insurance but we're going to give you  <br>00:22:20.000 through our platform or through app the  <br>00:22:21.880 ability to really self- tailor that so  <br>00:22:24.360 you've got you've got a a a blanket  <br>00:22:26.440 coverage or you can maybe upself for  <br>00:22:28.720 blank coverage and here's multiple  <br>00:22:31.000 scenarios everyone typically has a  <br>00:22:32.919 mother or father or somebody that might  <br>00:22:35.400 be unwell or somebody that's just been  <br>00:22:36.960 born or you just never know but you can  <br>00:22:39.679 you can suppose those scenarios and then  <br>00:22:42.320 you can provide processes and data for  <br>00:22:44.640 that and then once you do that you can  <br>00:22:47.240 go further down the rabbit hole and say  <br>00:22:49.200 okay this person is a diabetic okay we  <br>00:22:51.320 should set up relationships with  <br>00:22:52.600 diabetic firms to get bulk purchasing of  <br>00:22:55.919 this and make it available through the  <br>00:22:57.200 app as well so now suddenly were a super  <br>00:22:59.159 app because we're we're ordering we're  <br>00:23:01.400 now a logistics company right we're  <br>00:23:03.480 ordering um you know insulin or we're  <br>00:23:06.360 ordering headache tablets or blood  <br>00:23:08.039 pressure tablets or whatever and then  <br>00:23:10.360 you know you kind of go down that route  <br>00:23:12.559 I looked at a project before where we  <br>00:23:14.279 wanted  <br>00:23:15.200 to revolutionize the concept of a first  <br>00:23:18.120 aid kit we wanted to make a first aid  <br>00:23:19.840 kit or the concept of a first aid kit a  <br>00:23:22.200 smart device in a home so you think of  <br>00:23:24.520 the tech involved in in um opening your  <br>00:23:26.799 phone uh with your face or recording  <br>00:23:29.559 your voice or whatever if you had a sick  <br>00:23:31.480 parent the machine could bleep for the  <br>00:23:33.679 parent to come along it could dispense a  <br>00:23:35.880 tablet record that person taking the  <br>00:23:38.440 tablet talk them through the process  <br>00:23:40.400 reorder if necessary because it's a  <br>00:23:42.200 secure device with with digital  <br>00:23:44.159 encryption and then you as a son could  <br>00:23:46.799 be sent a little video oh yeah Dad took  <br>00:23:48.440 his medicine soor great solved so that's  <br>00:23:51.720 kind of how you you you lean into a  <br>00:23:53.559 process like insurance which in in  <br>00:23:55.799 Insurance worlds can just be erased to  <br>00:23:57.159 the bottom it can be price price price  <br>00:23:58.600 and and what's available for what  <br>00:24:00.640 different profile of insurance level you  <br>00:24:02.360 have but there's so much more to it if  <br>00:24:04.559 you make it about the human then you  <br>00:24:06.919 wrap the process around the human then  <br>00:24:08.559 you've got a bigger Market got it okay  <br>00:24:12.960 so the way that you describe everything  <br>00:24:15.520 clearly very intelligent around that but  <br>00:24:18.480 and and as you as you explain your  <br>00:24:19.720 journey apart from being at the  <br>00:24:20.880 beginning where up in the attic there  <br>00:24:22.440 and not really having much money behind  <br>00:24:24.000 you and boardroom tables that are a  <br>00:24:25.480 little bit too heavy and so on  <br>00:24:28.760 talk to me about because we always talk  <br>00:24:30.159 about the winds don't we we hear a lot  <br>00:24:31.919 about how someone turned this into this  <br>00:24:33.559 into this and it was yes B an IPO and Y  <br>00:24:35.799 didly everyone got very rich but you  <br>00:24:38.360 also spoke about how when when you when  <br>00:24:40.640 you look at people that have said  <br>00:24:41.720 setting up companies the ones that have  <br>00:24:43.200 failed before okay if you've made the  <br>00:24:45.720 mistakes then you'll you you they've  <br>00:24:47.240 probably been costly in the early stages  <br>00:24:49.039 and so you've learned some really  <br>00:24:50.039 valuable lessons yes tell me about a  <br>00:24:52.440 business that you got involved with that  <br>00:24:55.360 you look back now and you're like I wish  <br>00:24:58.000 I never did that but I got some valuable  <br>00:25:00.039 lessons from it um yes uh I remember  <br>00:25:03.440 being on on uh the chairman on a minor  <br>00:25:07.159 shareholder in a in a project with Nile  <br>00:25:10.000 Horn you know from One Direction okay  <br>00:25:12.399 and uh it was in Nile Emoji so it was he  <br>00:25:15.799 consulted with our designers to create  <br>00:25:17.480 different emojis of his face all  <br>00:25:20.120 selected by him and signed off by him  <br>00:25:22.480 and then when he released his album uh  <br>00:25:25.559 it was I think it his first solo album  <br>00:25:27.240 maybe his second solo album  <br>00:25:29.120 um we released this at the same time  <br>00:25:30.919 with his Blessing like he was part he  <br>00:25:32.360 was a director in the firm and and a  <br>00:25:33.919 shareholder and we released it and it  <br>00:25:36.679 was a lot of work and it was a lot of  <br>00:25:38.480 advertising also amazing to see the  <br>00:25:41.360 power of celebrity endorsement because  <br>00:25:43.360 as soon as it went out on his Instagram  <br>00:25:45.640 and his Twitter and his Facebook at the  <br>00:25:48.360 time you literally you saw okay five  <br>00:25:51.399 likes 10 likes th000 likes 5,000 likes  <br>00:25:54.399 15,000 likes I've literally videos of it  <br>00:25:56.520 just it was just incredible that reach  <br>00:25:59.679 and uh you know because that was you  <br>00:26:02.520 know I knew some older celebrities being  <br>00:26:04.480 Ireland is a small place right you know  <br>00:26:06.039 some of the old singers and actors and  <br>00:26:07.399 so on but um the the kind of kidy Markus  <br>00:26:11.640 I'm watching The Power of of the act the  <br>00:26:13.600 hive of activity and so on but  <br>00:26:16.120 interestingly it was the day of the  <br>00:26:18.080 launch of the album people were  <br>00:26:20.600 delighted to by the album and then they  <br>00:26:21.960 complained like helled spending 99 cents  <br>00:26:24.120 on a set of emojis so our guys are  <br>00:26:27.279 watching this we're saying okay well  <br>00:26:28.480 we'll do a competition if you get you  <br>00:26:30.679 know 50 likes we'll send it to you for  <br>00:26:32.120 free kind of stuff and but it was just  <br>00:26:35.080 uh just did not work the whole thing all  <br>00:26:37.919 the work everything it just didn't work  <br>00:26:39.640 and and we thought we'd leverage the  <br>00:26:42.399 love that he has from the audience and  <br>00:26:44.440 so on and uh sorry now but um it just it  <br>00:26:49.480 helped reinforce probably his album  <br>00:26:51.039 sales so I'm sure he did well out of it  <br>00:26:52.640 but as a business I think it made about  <br>00:26:54.679 20 grand and it didn't it didn't cover  <br>00:26:57.200 anything at all um another one I had was  <br>00:27:00.640 was a takeaway from that you know you  <br>00:27:01.960 sat there and you know if you had to go  <br>00:27:04.039 back and do that again was that you  <br>00:27:05.320 learning that um the youngsters 999  <br>00:27:08.600 cents was just a step too much for them  <br>00:27:10.720 after buying the album or yeah I mean  <br>00:27:13.640 it's it's it's really about the power of  <br>00:27:16.080 the grow to Market strategy uh I'm not  <br>00:27:18.720 particularly adapt at thinking like a  <br>00:27:20.240 12-year-old girl and nor do I want to be  <br>00:27:23.000 um and but that's what it took to know  <br>00:27:24.919 if this was a good idea or not  <br>00:27:26.360 technically it worked beautifully  <br>00:27:28.679 integrated beautifully it was aligned  <br>00:27:30.799 brand on on point and on message all of  <br>00:27:33.360 those bits were absolutely right and you  <br>00:27:34.960 never know where the weak point is going  <br>00:27:36.600 to be and the weak point was in the  <br>00:27:39.279 acceptance of a 99 Cents purchase uh by  <br>00:27:43.240 by a 12-year-old fan and you just didn't  <br>00:27:48.360 get it do we didn't catch it and that's  <br>00:27:49.919 the go to market piece so and this  <br>00:27:52.320 happens very frequently with with  <br>00:27:54.640 technology-led startups they nail  <br>00:27:57.320 something new they do an amazing  <br>00:27:58.760 technical job of looking at something  <br>00:28:00.480 and and saying this is a brand new way  <br>00:28:01.960 of doing it but what they don't do is  <br>00:28:05.200 they connect it to the customer in in in  <br>00:28:07.880 the customer's terms and I suppose the  <br>00:28:10.000 lesson of that was doing it in a  <br>00:28:12.320 digestible way by the customer rather  <br>00:28:14.080 than what we thought they needed to hear  <br>00:28:16.039 or that we thought they wanted and  <br>00:28:18.360 sometimes you're inventing out of  <br>00:28:19.240 nothing so like here's a surprise thing  <br>00:28:21.080 same as an mden launch here's also an  <br>00:28:22.600 emoji go celebrate Nile didn't  <br>00:28:25.480 work interesting now  <br>00:28:28.760 how many how many startups have you got  <br>00:28:30.360 involved with if you count them in total  <br>00:28:33.000 oh uh 20 over the years and how many did  <br>00:28:37.399 you to choose 20 how many did you have  <br>00:28:39.960 come across your desk I'd love to be  <br>00:28:43.039 very strategic and say oh 700 in my team  <br>00:28:45.840 but up up until about three years ago  <br>00:28:47.679 I'd say I anything that came across my  <br>00:28:49.559 desk that I worked on um I I was  <br>00:28:52.440 involving in one way or other because I  <br>00:28:54.000 had a vicious appetite for but part of  <br>00:28:56.240 that process was consuming them to sort  <br>00:28:58.559 of go yeah it's never going to work and  <br>00:29:00.600 fine-tuning that process for myself and  <br>00:29:02.840 bringing people along in that process  <br>00:29:04.880 but very interesting when when covid  <br>00:29:06.880 happened and agency work diminished uh  <br>00:29:09.880 you know obviously because like we still  <br>00:29:12.480 had Nissan as a client I remember they  <br>00:29:13.799 rang me to say we haven't sold a car in  <br>00:29:15.679 six months you know and we need to  <br>00:29:17.159 reverse the project we were going to do  <br>00:29:18.919 but we'll talk to you later you can't  <br>00:29:20.760 blame anybody we had we had hotels we  <br>00:29:22.880 had Hotel kid out so you we went like  <br>00:29:25.279 this and then when the pandemic was over  <br>00:29:28.640 we accelerated through the roof we came  <br>00:29:30.080 up we gave free Consulting during the  <br>00:29:32.480 pandemic because I wanted to keep the  <br>00:29:34.240 people um it took a hit on balance  <br>00:29:36.600 sheets and so on but it meant that we  <br>00:29:38.559 were saying to our customers we'll give  <br>00:29:40.080 you free strategy free advice bit of  <br>00:29:41.799 technical support but remember us after  <br>00:29:43.480 the fact and and that's you know it came  <br>00:29:45.880 back with a vengeance so even when I had  <br>00:29:47.960 a a weak balance sheet on one agency the  <br>00:29:50.399 book of business came back with a  <br>00:29:51.480 flourish and it sold that on the up as  <br>00:29:53.159 well and that's another thing about  <br>00:29:54.799 selling is is the timing of of those  <br>00:29:56.840 sales but but  <br>00:29:59.000 um during the pandemic I put out a note  <br>00:30:01.720 on social media on LinkedIn and Twitter  <br>00:30:03.519 and so on to say in the spirit of  <br>00:30:06.039 everyone trying to help everybody uh and  <br>00:30:08.760 I had free time H I'm I'm willing to  <br>00:30:11.159 offer free half hour Zoom calls to  <br>00:30:14.200 anyone with a with a challenge or  <br>00:30:15.720 problem or to to fellow CEOs or  <br>00:30:18.320 entrepreneurs who would just wanted to  <br>00:30:19.600 talk I said the Only Rule was you're not  <br>00:30:21.799 LED sell to me I'm not alled to sell to  <br>00:30:23.320 you it's just a well met occasion where  <br>00:30:24.880 you can you can cry you can talk you you  <br>00:30:26.799 can do whatever and that was was  <br>00:30:28.880 fascinating to me I learned more about  <br>00:30:30.640 just you know I had CEOs on there who  <br>00:30:33.240 had you know a thousand people and  <br>00:30:35.720 suddenly they're literally told okay you  <br>00:30:37.799 you now need 20 people just to wind down  <br>00:30:40.279 the system to let everybody go and they  <br>00:30:42.519 find it hard looking in the mirror you  <br>00:30:43.880 know things of that I other on where you  <br>00:30:45.519 had a a 19-year-old saying I've got this  <br>00:30:47.720 great idea for Tech how do I engage the  <br>00:30:49.480 world and it's such a big answer you're  <br>00:30:52.600 like trying to break it down into  <br>00:30:53.919 meaningful chunks in an hour period of  <br>00:30:55.799 time to say well consider this first  <br>00:30:58.200 considered a second considered a third  <br>00:31:00.799 and the resistance to say go and get  <br>00:31:02.840 formal education before you try it  <br>00:31:04.519 because a lot of entrepreneurs don't  <br>00:31:05.960 want to do that they just want to get  <br>00:31:08.159 going um but then when I when I got more  <br>00:31:11.480 involved and I was kind of formerly  <br>00:31:13.559 chairman of a couple of these and it's  <br>00:31:15.120 easier to be an investment than a an  <br>00:31:16.760 investor than a chairman um I remember  <br>00:31:19.799 another instance a brilliant piece of  <br>00:31:21.200 tech too early to Market with a  <br>00:31:23.720 horrendous investor involved and the the  <br>00:31:28.120 damage I remember just trying to protect  <br>00:31:30.480 the startup team from that investor and  <br>00:31:33.120 he was taking finders fees for finding  <br>00:31:35.000 the money he was taking board seats all  <br>00:31:37.320 this kind of stuff he shall remain  <br>00:31:38.440 nameless but I remember this person  <br>00:31:41.360 would just in every board meeting just  <br>00:31:42.600 go on the attack because the CEO was  <br>00:31:44.600 young the COO were young they were the  <br>00:31:46.760 startup guys they were the the clever  <br>00:31:49.039 ones and this guy just no we need a  <br>00:31:52.039 50-year-old running that business you're  <br>00:31:53.840 terrible you're terrible and just attack  <br>00:31:55.440 attack attack and I would just spend the  <br>00:31:58.279 board meetings defending that person and  <br>00:32:00.919 and uh trying to find some kind of  <br>00:32:03.120 resonance be between people so again  <br>00:32:05.880 another weak point for a startup that  <br>00:32:07.279 you can't predict until you have the  <br>00:32:08.559 money and you're in flow and you don't  <br>00:32:10.880 expect it to be an internal problem you  <br>00:32:12.760 expect it to be the world connecting to  <br>00:32:14.600 the world is going to be the problem for  <br>00:32:15.919 the startups but it's a people game  <br>00:32:19.720 ultimately beay you to one of the  <br>00:32:21.440 property portals here in the UAE um I  <br>00:32:24.159 know the founders of that company and  <br>00:32:25.600 the parent company behind that wonderful  <br>00:32:27.559 human beings they have worked their ass  <br>00:32:31.159 off and I remember how long it took them  <br>00:32:33.639 to raise capital in the beginning now  <br>00:32:35.799 they're in a unicorn so they' done very  <br>00:32:37.399 well for themselves but I know the pain  <br>00:32:40.279 and I said to them you know what was it  <br>00:32:42.080 like at first and they went we were  <br>00:32:44.480 going to these these fundraising  <br>00:32:46.480 networking events and we went to a 100  <br>00:32:50.200 and we didn't know how to pitch MH we  <br>00:32:53.799 didn't know how to present we didn't  <br>00:32:55.639 really know what we were talking about  <br>00:32:57.720 and and it was after 100 events around  <br>00:33:01.559 that number that someone contacted them  <br>00:33:04.679 that had been at one of those events a  <br>00:33:06.080 few months earlier and that's where they  <br>00:33:08.480 got their first fund raise from they  <br>00:33:10.200 bootstrapped until then and I'm like did  <br>00:33:13.720 you just not know what you were doing  <br>00:33:15.240 they're like we didn't have a clue  <br>00:33:16.399 Spence we like genuinely didn't have a  <br>00:33:18.159 clue one of them one was at MIT the one  <br>00:33:21.120 was at Ox one was at cambrid super well  <br>00:33:22.760 educated people so you know all  <br>00:33:25.120 self-funded one was a finance guy one  <br>00:33:27.320 was a tech guy the other one was you  <br>00:33:28.840 know a marketing guy so and they're  <br>00:33:31.559 three brothers and so the trust was  <br>00:33:33.519 there and they're complimenting each  <br>00:33:34.799 other in terms of the skill sets was  <br>00:33:36.559 there um but none of them know what they  <br>00:33:38.919 were doing they look back on that now  <br>00:33:41.679 and they they're like it was just  <br>00:33:43.360 bloody-minded persistence that  <br>00:33:45.279 eventually got us there and I'm like had  <br>00:33:47.360 you known how to sell your concept sell  <br>00:33:49.960 your idea had you known how to genuinely  <br>00:33:52.559 build relationships and network with  <br>00:33:54.399 people what would be different they're  <br>00:33:56.679 like it would have been like is  <br>00:33:58.279 different yeah how often do you see  <br>00:34:01.000 entrepreneurs come to you that actually  <br>00:34:04.399 do have a good idea do have a good  <br>00:34:07.159 business they've started but just don't  <br>00:34:08.918 know how to verbalize it create a deck  <br>00:34:12.800 present it deliver it be passionate sell  <br>00:34:15.639 it essentially so that they can raise  <br>00:34:17.399 capital is that very frequent for you  <br>00:34:19.359 very frequent  <br>00:34:21.399 um the the very nature of what we've  <br>00:34:23.839 built in continuous Ventures now is  <br>00:34:25.760 we've got what's called A disruption un  <br>00:34:27.719 elligence team and that's all of these  <br>00:34:29.918 senior people that I used to make  <br>00:34:31.320 available every other Thursday in my my  <br>00:34:33.320 old instance of of companies we now have  <br>00:34:36.280 those people working full-time to  <br>00:34:38.159 support our Investment Portfolio and our  <br>00:34:40.119 startups and one of the big parts of  <br>00:34:42.879 their job is to reinforce any of the  <br>00:34:44.719 weak points that they see with anybody  <br>00:34:47.239 so you'll get superb technologists who  <br>00:34:50.520 like I say couldn't talk to a pretty  <br>00:34:52.000 girl or marketing person who can't  <br>00:34:54.119 explain a balance sheet or you know  <br>00:34:56.399 somebody who who won't understand why a  <br>00:34:58.920 particular color might be offensive in a  <br>00:35:00.440 certain territory if they're trying to  <br>00:35:01.680 sell it or things like that and you just  <br>00:35:03.839 never know where the weak points are so  <br>00:35:05.280 our team wrap themselves around those  <br>00:35:07.960 entrepreneurs to kind of make them as as  <br>00:35:11.440 copper fastened as possible on the  <br>00:35:13.040 journey so we see that every single day  <br>00:35:15.800 but it's not about oh that's not going  <br>00:35:18.240 to work because you're not the right guy  <br>00:35:19.760 to see this through I mean we've  <br>00:35:21.800 recalibrated firms in the past where the  <br>00:35:25.280 CEO is clearly not going to be you know  <br>00:35:27.240 you you get start of two two people one  <br>00:35:29.160 of them is the CEO right and you're like  <br>00:35:30.680 soly they're like LinkedIn I'm a CEO and  <br>00:35:32.440 director and it goes straight to their  <br>00:35:34.079 head and you're just like okay well what  <br>00:35:36.200 what oh you know we we um we do social  <br>00:35:38.920 media posts for a living you know that's  <br>00:35:40.760 that's our business but you look at them  <br>00:35:42.480 see look Le let's be frank you're not a  <br>00:35:45.079 CEO material but you're a brilliant  <br>00:35:46.880 Chief Innovation officer or you're great  <br>00:35:48.560 you're an ideas man or I mean we took  <br>00:35:50.760 one firm uh a couple years ago and we we  <br>00:35:53.240 recalibrated an an eight-year startup  <br>00:35:56.599 that had a patent and had a CEO who was  <br>00:35:59.240 tired and and a little begrudging that  <br>00:36:01.640 it hadn't gone better for him and we  <br>00:36:03.839 recalibrated moved him  <br>00:36:05.920 from Ireland where he was trying to  <br>00:36:08.359 Target um he was trying to Target the UK  <br>00:36:11.560 so we moved him into the region he was  <br>00:36:13.160 trying to Target registered a fresh  <br>00:36:15.040 company moved the patent and then re  <br>00:36:18.119 repositioned him as a Dyson type  <br>00:36:20.240 character he was like this is a new  <br>00:36:21.800 green startup with a full-time inventor  <br>00:36:24.960 then the interest came and that was  <br>00:36:28.160 pretty much the price of registering a  <br>00:36:29.680 firm and a little bit of message but how  <br>00:36:32.480 it was perceived by the market was where  <br>00:36:34.720 the secret sauce starts coming in  <br>00:36:36.160 suddenly you've got you know the same  <br>00:36:38.240 story told differently but now there's  <br>00:36:40.560 an appetite for it and it it kind of  <br>00:36:42.800 comes down you know the they say with  <br>00:36:44.560 the startups you know whether whether  <br>00:36:46.319 it's um luck or perseverance or after 10  <br>00:36:50.200 years in overnight success or any of  <br>00:36:52.040 this but you often hear this thing of  <br>00:36:54.079 fake it till you make it I don't believe  <br>00:36:56.280 in that for a second  <br>00:36:58.200 because faking it till you make it seems  <br>00:37:00.720 like Chancery seems like you're you're  <br>00:37:02.720 pretending you're worthwhile and then  <br>00:37:04.240 suddenly it might happen for you I from  <br>00:37:06.880 you believe in Project it then grow into  <br>00:37:09.359 that projection then project again grow  <br>00:37:11.160 into that projection again because it's  <br>00:37:12.839 driving yourself it's putting a future  <br>00:37:15.240 path there it's assuming success and  <br>00:37:18.000 it's not apologetic there's no imposter  <br>00:37:19.960 syndrome there's not anything that like  <br>00:37:22.079 oh thank God we got that deal or thank  <br>00:37:23.839 God they believed in us enough to sign a  <br>00:37:26.000 contract you're just saying I'm headed  <br>00:37:27.839 there who's with me it's a much more  <br>00:37:30.000 powerful message and then that means  <br>00:37:32.480 that you in in a technology firm or in a  <br>00:37:35.480 logistics firm or a data firm you're  <br>00:37:37.599 still putting people first the  <br>00:37:39.079 connection with the customer and your  <br>00:37:41.040 connection with the staff and and  <br>00:37:42.400 marrying those two things and uh you I  <br>00:37:45.920 think that's where the secret sauce in  <br>00:37:47.400 any of these startups  <br>00:37:49.520 lies interesting  <br>00:37:53.520 okay first of I'm going to ask this  <br>00:37:55.560 question because I know there's going to  <br>00:37:56.640 be a really great answer to this but  <br>00:37:58.960 before I ask the question let's give  <br>00:38:00.200 some context here you're you're a big  <br>00:38:02.000 fan of iido yes how long have you been  <br>00:38:04.400 doing Aikido for I started Aikido  <br>00:38:06.960 shortly after starting Continuum so  <br>00:38:08.800 would have been about 2003 okay I had  <br>00:38:11.040 done different martial arts but I had  <br>00:38:12.400 also been injured so I I took a break  <br>00:38:14.960 and then I took it up full-time in 2003  <br>00:38:18.200 what is  <br>00:38:20.000 iido uh what is aido so it's a Japanese  <br>00:38:22.760 martial arts form but it's it's um while  <br>00:38:26.599 it's full Conta  <br>00:38:27.960 it's designed to be a peaceful martial  <br>00:38:30.800 art so understanding the physics of the  <br>00:38:33.520 body the philosophy of movement the  <br>00:38:35.800 philosophy of solving Conflict by  <br>00:38:37.720 blending with conflict centrifugal kind  <br>00:38:40.480 of movements and so on it's it's really  <br>00:38:43.040 designed to be a living breathing  <br>00:38:45.000 martial art as opposed to clashing with  <br>00:38:46.800 something so what I'd have is you know  <br>00:38:50.200 um historically I did Ninjutsu I did  <br>00:38:52.920 Karate I did aido with Ninjutsu if  <br>00:38:55.839 someone tried to hit you over the head  <br>00:38:56.880 with an iron bar  <br>00:38:58.280 you they teach how to dislocate the arm  <br>00:39:00.280 right pretty violent pretty aggressive  <br>00:39:02.520 in Kempo they'd say here this is how you  <br>00:39:04.760 snap a block and you might hurt your arm  <br>00:39:06.960 but at least it's not your head in iido  <br>00:39:09.440 they say firstly as a guyy swinging down  <br>00:39:11.400 a bar at you don't be  <br>00:39:14.319 there and secondly see he's got he's  <br>00:39:16.680 gone to all this effort and all this  <br>00:39:18.319 energy to attack you why not manipulate  <br>00:39:21.160 that and redistribute it into the  <br>00:39:22.640 universe and get on with your life you  <br>00:39:24.520 know and when I say don't be there the B  <br>00:39:26.680 the best marshal is to not physically be  <br>00:39:28.800 there to recognize the signs that's  <br>00:39:31.040 Brewing over there so girlfriend let's  <br>00:39:33.440 go we walk out the door but if an attack  <br>00:39:36.480 comes to understand the physics of that  <br>00:39:38.920 motion and the little telltale signs you  <br>00:39:41.440 see in people to understand the  <br>00:39:43.640 aggression to understand the movement  <br>00:39:45.079 and then blend with it you know the best  <br>00:39:47.319 way to kill an enemy as sunu we were  <br>00:39:49.520 joking about sunsu earlier is to make  <br>00:39:51.480 them your friend it's the biggest way to  <br>00:39:52.920 evaporate an enemy so if you blend with  <br>00:39:55.079 an attack the attack disappears and  <br>00:39:57.560 that's kind of the philosophy behind the  <br>00:40:00.200 the physicality of iido and I think the  <br>00:40:03.280 this it was one of those things where as  <br>00:40:06.280 I got to know it and I got to practice  <br>00:40:08.200 it it just suited my mindset and it felt  <br>00:40:11.119 like it was kind of a a missing spine in  <br>00:40:13.760 the Journey of my life it kind of  <br>00:40:15.359 connected some significant points in my  <br>00:40:17.560 life and it just made sense it was about  <br>00:40:20.240 blending with things instead of classing  <br>00:40:21.920 with things it changed your tone of  <br>00:40:23.760 voice it changed how you if you took it  <br>00:40:25.760 in you know if it really meant something  <br>00:40:27.400 to you the kind of underlying concept of  <br>00:40:30.800 Bushido is life in every breath and how  <br>00:40:34.520 that translated for me into into life  <br>00:40:36.960 and then into business was be deliberate  <br>00:40:40.280 we're having a conversation I'm looking  <br>00:40:41.800 not looking at my phone we're having cup  <br>00:40:43.920 of tea we're enjoying the tea if we're  <br>00:40:45.560 doing Japanese archery look at the focus  <br>00:40:48.000 that they have in that it was just about  <br>00:40:49.880 being deliberate in the moment and being  <br>00:40:52.160 free to to really really appreciate that  <br>00:40:54.319 moment and it's something I've  <br>00:40:55.359 definitely applied to life it's  <br>00:40:56.520 something I've definitely applied to  <br>00:40:57.720 work and even the guys in continuous  <br>00:40:59.839 ventes would slag me that's you know I'm  <br>00:41:01.640 overusing the word deliberate but you  <br>00:41:04.040 know even the work is like is what we're  <br>00:41:05.760 doing on purpose can it be challenged  <br>00:41:08.160 can it be defended and these are  <br>00:41:09.800 questions the startups need to hear as  <br>00:41:11.240 well as well as being a human going  <br>00:41:13.640 through this process every single part  <br>00:41:16.240 of our business process has to be  <br>00:41:17.960 measured kpi defended qualified so then  <br>00:41:21.000 it moves through to different phases but  <br>00:41:23.160 certainly for my own life it made it  <br>00:41:26.920 made a lot of sense and probably solved  <br>00:41:29.560 things in me you know um that I was  <br>00:41:32.040 struggling with fear and and you know a  <br>00:41:34.640 history of being bullied and all these  <br>00:41:36.319 things that you can choose to set down  <br>00:41:38.880 over time if you if you address it  <br>00:41:41.880 correctly you know you you talk about  <br>00:41:44.280 being bullied but you're sitting here  <br>00:41:45.800 opposite me and we're worried about the  <br>00:41:47.839 legs being too tall on the chair because  <br>00:41:49.560 you're you're you're you're you're a  <br>00:41:51.000 giant of a man you're you know did that  <br>00:41:54.480 that kind of and and and I'm sure when  <br>00:41:56.160 you were younger you you were probably  <br>00:41:58.200 tall and skinny as opposed to being tall  <br>00:42:00.800 and Broad yeah I was I was a clumsy  <br>00:42:02.920 puppy big feet B hands so so how old  <br>00:42:07.319 were you when you started kind of like  <br>00:42:08.720 to fill out and start to become this the  <br>00:42:10.880 strapping kind of guy you are now well  <br>00:42:13.160 thank you for noticing  <br>00:42:14.800 uh I was is that a chat upline or  <br>00:42:17.400 something yeah did you get with that  <br>00:42:19.720 recorded um I was probably I was being  <br>00:42:23.160 extremely badly badly bullied um I had  <br>00:42:26.359 an older brother who was who was uh  <br>00:42:28.359 rather rather intense and wired wrong um  <br>00:42:31.760 so I was being bullied at at home when  <br>00:42:33.760 my parents were there my parents were  <br>00:42:35.520 amazing um both work fulltime to put us  <br>00:42:37.880 into private school so they were often  <br>00:42:39.640 not there H and uh my brother was was a  <br>00:42:42.880 tough not and in the spirit of healing  <br>00:42:44.680 through understanding I think he was  <br>00:42:45.960 bullied by his friends or certainly the  <br>00:42:47.680 weak one in his group so he used to take  <br>00:42:49.680 it out of me um but it just meant then  <br>00:42:52.480 that I was going to school feeling you  <br>00:42:54.839 know vulnerable and I used to have to go  <br>00:42:57.200 go through City Center in Dublin in a  <br>00:42:59.079 private school uniform through the the  <br>00:43:01.960 the kind of working class areas from the  <br>00:43:03.520 from the railway stations and so on with  <br>00:43:05.760 like a tin Whistler recorder sticking  <br>00:43:07.319 out of side and so it was fair game  <br>00:43:09.319 right to the neighborhood and then I get  <br>00:43:11.359 into class and you know you'd kind of  <br>00:43:13.240 put your cat and you go back to your  <br>00:43:14.559 desk and your bag is in the bin or  <br>00:43:16.400 there's chocolate over your it was just  <br>00:43:18.160 this  <br>00:43:19.319 ongoing you know mood I remember saying  <br>00:43:22.400 to my parents I really wanted to move  <br>00:43:23.680 school and when they drilled into it I  <br>00:43:25.599 couldn't admit I was being bullied I  <br>00:43:26.960 just just was trying to say because I  <br>00:43:29.559 just want to move schools I want to move  <br>00:43:30.800 schools I'm delighted I didn't and my  <br>00:43:32.200 parents were amazing about it I just  <br>00:43:34.559 never told them and then years later I  <br>00:43:37.920 was working on a book in Africa in 2008  <br>00:43:41.319 I think and I gave them the first draft  <br>00:43:43.440 and it was the first time I told him  <br>00:43:44.359 about what I'd been through and so on  <br>00:43:46.960 and uh I remember my dad God West was  <br>00:43:49.960 was really shocked had no idea you know  <br>00:43:53.200 and uh but so it culminated I got  <br>00:43:55.760 attacked one day my brother started  <br>00:43:57.440 smoking and he arranged for a guy to  <br>00:43:58.920 Ambush me with a knife pinned me against  <br>00:44:00.680 the wall I was like 13 and I froze  <br>00:44:03.480 completely froze and uh it's funny I can  <br>00:44:06.800 still remember now but I remember it was  <br>00:44:09.079 the freezing worried me more than  <br>00:44:10.559 anything else uh if the guy punched me  <br>00:44:13.200 or something that would have been  <br>00:44:14.240 probably easier uh I was playing rugby  <br>00:44:16.839 for school and so on so I was I I was  <br>00:44:19.359 tall so I couldn't not do rugby but I  <br>00:44:21.760 was uh when when something comes out of  <br>00:44:23.559 the universe and attacks you you can't  <br>00:44:25.079 rationalize that and it sat would me  <br>00:44:26.640 very bad  <br>00:44:28.400 um and they long story short about six  <br>00:44:29.800 months later of of worrying about that I  <br>00:44:32.200 I I stopped at a martial arts center on  <br>00:44:33.839 a Saturday and it was just these mixed  <br>00:44:36.640 various martial arts who' obviously  <br>00:44:38.000 taken a lease together and I I went in  <br>00:44:39.720 and it was Ninjutsu which is a very  <br>00:44:41.640 impressive gymnastic martial arts they  <br>00:44:44.040 were black they look cool it was like  <br>00:44:45.520 something out of the movies but I was  <br>00:44:47.280 still this nervous kid you know clumsy  <br>00:44:50.559 and and and and timid but I spoke to the  <br>00:44:54.680 the trainer afterwards and I I just went  <br>00:44:56.319 up and said look I don't want to do this  <br>00:44:57.359 or anything but can I just tell you I  <br>00:44:59.440 told him about what happened and I said  <br>00:45:01.079 can I how do you not freeze was the  <br>00:45:03.880 question basically I was kind of  <br>00:45:05.319 struggling to to get out and he just  <br>00:45:07.520 said look this people talk about fight  <br>00:45:09.599 and flight but it's actually fight  <br>00:45:11.000 flight and freeze and he said the the  <br>00:45:13.200 challenge is you'll always have the  <br>00:45:14.440 reaction you'll always be a freezer but  <br>00:45:16.480 you can learn to be switched on by it  <br>00:45:18.280 rather than switched off so the moment  <br>00:45:19.720 it happens you go you you move rather  <br>00:45:22.200 than freeze doesn't mean you haven't  <br>00:45:23.680 Frozen but you recognize the symptoms  <br>00:45:25.200 and off you go and I I I then went down  <br>00:45:29.119 the route of you know Ninjutsu and and  <br>00:45:31.720 Kempo and literally tournaments fighting  <br>00:45:33.760 and all this kind of stuff so built a  <br>00:45:36.200 pair of shoulders built a pair of arms  <br>00:45:38.160 had to run with my brother one time it  <br>00:45:39.680 was the last time he ever had to run  <br>00:45:41.000 with  <br>00:45:41.960 me and uh kind of built it out from  <br>00:45:44.319 there but I got that out of my system  <br>00:45:46.359 but very interestingly I became the kind  <br>00:45:48.040 of the anti-bully then if I saw kids  <br>00:45:49.839 getting bullied I'd step forward and you  <br>00:45:54.160 know it and it really helped me with  <br>00:45:55.880 with with work over over the years  <br>00:45:58.440 because I then start to antagonize  <br>00:46:00.720 because if things got violent I was kind  <br>00:46:03.040 of comfortable with that you know you're  <br>00:46:04.160 16 you're cocky then you have a chest  <br>00:46:05.760 and you feel like you're bulletproof but  <br>00:46:08.240 um you'd antagonize and then you'd look  <br>00:46:10.480 for the little nonverbal signs or the  <br>00:46:12.640 reactions and things like that you know  <br>00:46:14.200 you you'd see a guy going hell would you  <br>00:46:16.640 but he'd look around three people around  <br>00:46:18.400 him looking to be egged on or something  <br>00:46:20.559 and I found that piece absolutely  <br>00:46:22.280 fascinating the non-verbal piece and  <br>00:46:25.400 that's been a huge influence in in my  <br>00:46:27.559 life I even like when I watch the news I  <br>00:46:29.400 turn this the sound off and I just watch  <br>00:46:32.040 the politicians because they usually you  <br>00:46:34.400 know in a in a pressurized live  <br>00:46:36.440 environment trying to you know peacock  <br>00:46:38.440 or whatever they're doing and I just  <br>00:46:40.319 kept on watching for non-verbal cues  <br>00:46:42.720 which helped with martial arts because I  <br>00:46:45.319 you know I burnt out of the feir wasn't  <br>00:46:47.440 afraid of anything anymore so I can  <br>00:46:48.960 stand on the stage of 10,000 people now  <br>00:46:50.720 and you know not say boo it it doesn't  <br>00:46:53.480 bother me at all I played music any of  <br>00:46:55.680 these things I just in my write this now  <br>00:46:58.720 and again it was in the moment that kind  <br>00:47:00.960 of mindfulness not bringing anything  <br>00:47:03.359 else into it except for what I needed  <br>00:47:05.720 there and then you know I used to think  <br>00:47:07.520 of it like you know Newton's cradles  <br>00:47:09.359 those balls that go I used to in my mind  <br>00:47:12.480 I used to imagine I could just decide  <br>00:47:14.240 and they they'd just stop and start  <br>00:47:16.040 swinging together instead of clacking  <br>00:47:17.559 against each other and and that was I I  <br>00:47:19.599 I learn learned a phrase much later on  <br>00:47:21.800 called equipoise and it was just about  <br>00:47:24.359 that kind of centeredness and Stillness  <br>00:47:26.319 and so on it sounds a bit cliche but  <br>00:47:28.880 when you just decide okay this now and  <br>00:47:31.800 nothing else it comes to you that that  <br>00:47:35.040 that confidence and that that calmness  <br>00:47:37.079 and uh aido and Bushido that kind of  <br>00:47:39.839 philosophy just just sat with that well  <br>00:47:42.000 you know so that's kept me to this  <br>00:47:46.760 day for me it's trying  <br>00:47:49.400 to to  <br>00:47:51.599 take somebody who's been through an  <br>00:47:54.160 experience is taking on a martial art  <br>00:47:56.599 that's toughened him up he's then moved  <br>00:47:59.000 to another  <br>00:48:00.720 form and and then that form which seems  <br>00:48:03.880 like a a more as you as you describe a  <br>00:48:07.040 calmer um more thoughtful more flow  <br>00:48:09.640 inducing form  <br>00:48:12.119 and I can see how taken on the martial  <br>00:48:14.920 art at the beginning there potentially  <br>00:48:17.000 solved a problem and it was like I the  <br>00:48:20.559 freezing thing that I want to go there  <br>00:48:22.359 if that man can help me not freeze then  <br>00:48:24.520 that's that's the problem I'm trying to  <br>00:48:25.839 solve when when you look at businesses  <br>00:48:28.240 that you've built and you sold and ones  <br>00:48:29.520 that you've been involved with as well  <br>00:48:31.319 when you take on akido and its  <br>00:48:33.559 principles you talk about as you just  <br>00:48:35.760 said earlier deliberate okay so that's  <br>00:48:37.520 clearly something that's ingrained in  <br>00:48:39.280 you within within that that that that uh  <br>00:48:42.000 process that you  <br>00:48:44.520 apply do you find yourself watching  <br>00:48:48.119 People's lack of because you're so  <br>00:48:51.760 strong in your knowledge around does it  <br>00:48:54.160 do you understand what I mean that I do  <br>00:48:56.079 I do because to me it's kind of like  <br>00:48:57.799 that it's it's who you are so that that  <br>00:49:01.559 would make it almost like you could  <br>00:49:03.000 notice it so apparently to you when  <br>00:49:05.160 people and does it make you go okay he  <br>00:49:07.160 doesn't know this kind of stuff or does  <br>00:49:08.319 it make you go for goodness sake you  <br>00:49:10.880 donut yeah there's a bit of there's a  <br>00:49:13.079 bit of is that there's a bit of that I  <br>00:49:15.200 mean uh we had planned I hope he's not  <br>00:49:17.160 been with me yeah no no no no you're  <br>00:49:20.200 you're you're safe enough we're in a  <br>00:49:21.559 safe place safe place we had planned a  <br>00:49:24.559 Trilogy of books when I was working with  <br>00:49:26.240 an old friend friend of mine who's who's  <br>00:49:27.359 very sick now we can't we can't proceed  <br>00:49:28.920 with it but but we had decided on on on  <br>00:49:31.799 writing three books and the first one  <br>00:49:33.960 was called the tribe of one and it was  <br>00:49:35.359 about looking at because we're not  <br>00:49:37.079 qualified it was only philos philosophy  <br>00:49:39.280 it wasn't we're not qualified to go any  <br>00:49:41.160 deeper on it but we were just we did  <br>00:49:42.920 some work in Africa together we did some  <br>00:49:44.240 work in London together and we're just  <br>00:49:45.599 looking at people and watching people  <br>00:49:47.319 and you know you you'd watch you know  <br>00:49:50.240 Canary Warf at quarter 8 in the morning  <br>00:49:53.400 and you just see people running up a  <br>00:49:55.440 moving escalator and you know on their  <br>00:49:58.200 phone earphones and you just kind of  <br>00:50:00.520 wondering about how people see their own  <br>00:50:02.920 life and how they navigate through a day  <br>00:50:04.720 right and and what they don't do and  <br>00:50:06.599 what they don't stop to take in and I  <br>00:50:08.640 don't mean you know stare at the trees  <br>00:50:10.400 and and Forest bath or any of this stuff  <br>00:50:12.359 which is all amazing stuff but actually  <br>00:50:14.559 just are they given themselves a moment  <br>00:50:17.280 I mean one of the things I've enjoyed  <br>00:50:19.839 particularly after an exit is you have  <br>00:50:21.760 time in your day to think about your day  <br>00:50:24.160 not to think about what you have to get  <br>00:50:25.440 done you know I'm not you're a great  <br>00:50:27.960 early riser I mean you're you written  <br>00:50:30.359 the book on it by the time I see your  <br>00:50:32.440 Instagram post five hours has passed I'm  <br>00:50:34.559 like oh he's he's back from the desert  <br>00:50:36.040 already but you know I I'm I'm  <br>00:50:38.799 not but there's moments in my day  <br>00:50:40.960 there's waves in my day like I would  <br>00:50:42.240 only do email twice a week um I would  <br>00:50:45.480 only you know there's certain things I  <br>00:50:46.880 don't allow say that again because I  <br>00:50:48.599 don't think people would have picked  <br>00:50:49.680 that up you do emails twice a week yeah  <br>00:50:51.799 so I would have typically about two two  <br>00:50:54.640 hour Windows a week to do email  <br>00:50:57.680 I and that is the only time you would  <br>00:50:59.280 respond and Zend  <br>00:51:01.119 y consciously consciously deliberately  <br>00:51:04.079 like you if you email me you'll get an  <br>00:51:05.880 out of office saying you  <br>00:51:08.720 know in small Windows of time I'll be  <br>00:51:10.920 able to answer you but if here's an  <br>00:51:12.280 escalation process if it's something  <br>00:51:13.760 bigger I have an amazing assistant  <br>00:51:15.760 Sunshine hello but um it's it's just  <br>00:51:20.160 that's if I'm sitting at a desk I'm not  <br>00:51:21.599 doing my job really not and so you don't  <br>00:51:26.079 get moment  <br>00:51:27.520 you don't build energy you don't build  <br>00:51:29.280 teams you don't build resonance between  <br>00:51:31.040 teams by sending emails and so on in  <br>00:51:33.839 fact emails are usually after the fact  <br>00:51:35.480 when you're trying to catch things or  <br>00:51:37.160 blame things you know um when I was  <br>00:51:39.640 interviewing for the the dni team and  <br>00:51:42.040 and my partner column in continuous I  <br>00:51:45.079 was looking for extreme talent because  <br>00:51:47.200 we knew we we wanted to build a  <br>00:51:48.520 worldclass team and we knew they were  <br>00:51:50.200 all very very experienced people to  <br>00:51:52.720 people that I hoped I'd I'd struggle to  <br>00:51:54.799 interview because they were so good  <br>00:51:57.119 and and that's what I wanted I wanted to  <br>00:51:59.160 be the dumbest guy in that room as I  <br>00:52:00.680 said but I wasn't just looking at them  <br>00:52:03.000 from their extreme skill set are their  <br>00:52:05.280 extreme experience or perspective on the  <br>00:52:07.400 world I was looking at them seeing how  <br>00:52:09.160 would they resonate with another extreme  <br>00:52:11.720 person in another part of what we call  <br>00:52:14.040 the different lenses how we look at all  <br>00:52:16.319 of our deal flow all of these lenses  <br>00:52:18.720 design creativity data science quants  <br>00:52:20.839 everything they all look at anything we  <br>00:52:22.200 bring to the table and and bring if we  <br>00:52:25.200 if we commit to investing we bring bring  <br>00:52:26.680 that entrepreneur on the journey so it's  <br>00:52:29.000 how these people resonate with  <br>00:52:30.920 others and yeah you can sort of go right  <br>00:52:34.640 you look around and think oh I've got an  <br>00:52:35.920 advantage of you I've got an advantage  <br>00:52:37.000 of you but that's only if you're letting  <br>00:52:38.920 your ego trigger like you see those  <br>00:52:41.640 those little videos on on YouTube where  <br>00:52:43.960 you where the shark swins and all the  <br>00:52:45.400 fish avoid it all the time that's the  <br>00:52:47.520 that effect you'll end up being alone  <br>00:52:49.160 right you'll be of the Walk but you  <br>00:52:50.839 end up being alone because you're making  <br>00:52:52.760 it about you when you remove that and  <br>00:52:55.359 you make it about other people  <br>00:52:57.520 then things start to change and to me  <br>00:53:00.359 the most successful entrepreneurs that I  <br>00:53:02.000 see both the ones that are billionaires  <br>00:53:04.319 and the ones that are just starting off  <br>00:53:07.079 they're cam they're able to be  <br>00:53:09.200 comfortable around anybody they  <br>00:53:11.040 literally have that ability to what I  <br>00:53:13.119 call a network chameleon they they can  <br>00:53:14.680 kind of adapt and helps when you're  <br>00:53:16.440 talking about pitching and so on if I'm  <br>00:53:19.040 telling you about me I'm kind of failing  <br>00:53:21.240 the message here MH and it's that all  <br>00:53:23.200 that just people hate being sold to but  <br>00:53:25.280 they love buying you love to go in and  <br>00:53:27.319 say right there's a brand new car it's  <br>00:53:28.520 mine but you don't want the Slick guy  <br>00:53:30.000 going oh you'd look right in this sir  <br>00:53:31.839 you know saying you're allergic to that  <br>00:53:33.119 you go go away from me and but the more  <br>00:53:36.480 you blend with people the more you can  <br>00:53:37.680 adapt people and this is your language  <br>00:53:39.240 your framework um you I know you've  <br>00:53:41.760 you've talked to Chris Voss before he's  <br>00:53:43.480 a master in talking about mirroring and  <br>00:53:45.760 and making the conversation turning  <br>00:53:47.319 their own sentence on them again and  <br>00:53:49.720 again all of these tips and tricks help  <br>00:53:52.079 how you relate to people and then I'd  <br>00:53:54.559 always say there's two types of people  <br>00:53:55.920 in the world there drains and there  <br>00:53:57.400 radiators people who are exuding energy  <br>00:54:00.079 and other people who are just the room  <br>00:54:01.680 is empty with them in it and I don't do  <br>00:54:03.920 very well around  <br>00:54:06.200 drains that's fantastic okay um you  <br>00:54:09.599 recently moved to Dubai yes you've been  <br>00:54:11.640 here I think a few months now 108 days  <br>00:54:14.640 and you you came across a island and and  <br>00:54:17.280 and and you told me when we had the  <br>00:54:18.760 dinner that evening that you had sold  <br>00:54:21.720 everything moved here and bought nothing  <br>00:54:24.640 yep which seemed a little bit weird now  <br>00:54:27.760 I would I would I would suggest bought  <br>00:54:29.920 nothing whilst you're deciding what to  <br>00:54:31.720 buy maybe there there's a there's a  <br>00:54:33.520 reason for not but the Liberation that  <br>00:54:36.720 seemed to be in your eyes when you were  <br>00:54:38.599 explaining this to me at the time so can  <br>00:54:40.520 you just share that with me again and  <br>00:54:42.160 why did you do that and how does that  <br>00:54:43.599 feel well it it feels fantastic I mean  <br>00:54:46.960 you know firstly it was a nice exercise  <br>00:54:50.040 in in detaching from things so you you  <br>00:54:52.760 you you know has his cars and so on uh  <br>00:54:56.160 it it's nice to just shake all that off  <br>00:54:58.839 not even just from an operational point  <br>00:55:00.319 of view you know um but just from a a  <br>00:55:04.160 detached of of of feelings  <br>00:55:07.839 the sharing things with people is very  <br>00:55:10.200 very important and going through things  <br>00:55:12.440 with people are very important but like  <br>00:55:14.359 the last time I went back to duin I  <br>00:55:16.760 visited my my house which is now sold as  <br>00:55:20.160 well and uh it didn't feel like a home  <br>00:55:23.200 anymore and it was a very clear thing  <br>00:55:25.319 and it just reminded me that that was  <br>00:55:26.839 just stuff I actually pride myself on  <br>00:55:29.160 the stuff that I don't need I don't even  <br>00:55:30.720 have a car here or anything and uh it's  <br>00:55:33.599 just about my family now that will  <br>00:55:35.960 change over time because you know Dubai  <br>00:55:38.559 is lovely and there's lovely places to  <br>00:55:40.079 live and and and uh my kids want things  <br>00:55:42.799 and so on but as it stands currently  <br>00:55:45.240 granted I own Investments and companies  <br>00:55:47.280 and so on but that's all you know in a  <br>00:55:49.400 portfolio somewhere other than that I'm  <br>00:55:51.599 completely free and it's great and it  <br>00:55:54.039 just it just resets you and it reminds  <br>00:55:55.720 you that  <br>00:55:57.319 the people that are traveling with you  <br>00:55:58.680 and the moments you're going through are  <br>00:56:00.319 so much more important than stuff and  <br>00:56:02.440 stuff depreciates but people and  <br>00:56:04.680 relationships hopefully appreciate and  <br>00:56:07.359 just drives that point home to you the  <br>00:56:09.119 guy that's the founder of telegram Pavo  <br>00:56:11.680 I for what his surname he F he famously  <br>00:56:14.000 said in an interview he said I own  <br>00:56:15.319 nothing he said why would you want to  <br>00:56:17.240 own stuff like that it gets in the way  <br>00:56:19.000 of your freedom to be yeah I mean you  <br>00:56:21.799 you you made me struggle Z tell me to  <br>00:56:23.520 wear not a black T-shirt I literally  <br>00:56:25.400 just wear a black T-shirt every day I'm  <br>00:56:28.079 like this morning like what will I  <br>00:56:30.880 wear that was my biggest challenge you  <br>00:56:33.160 know  <br>00:56:34.000 yeah you've won some awards yeah when  <br>00:56:37.599 you win awards for the work that you do  <br>00:56:39.240 and I'll just I'll just make sure that  <br>00:56:40.559 we share these here with with amazing  <br>00:56:42.640 talented people not just yeah with  <br>00:56:44.599 amazing talented people when we talk  <br>00:56:46.000

win you win these award  <br>00:57:05.240 and how does it feel to win  <br>00:57:09.000 Awards uh I think it's because you went  <br>00:57:11.599 to Career recently yes I did yeah South  <br>00:57:13.839 Korea yeah three weeks ago that was we  <br>00:57:17.319 could do a whole podcast on that  <br>00:57:19.039 experience yeah and that was L you that  <br>00:57:21.319 was that was we we were in the National  <br>00:57:23.799 Assembly and was presented an award  <br>00:57:26.760 um for our kind of ethical Investments  <br>00:57:29.240 our ESG Investments for continuous

and we're moving very fast  <br>00:57:39.240 but that was very touching the welcome  <br>00:57:41.039 we got was very touching uh myself and  <br>00:57:43.039 the team were were all uh greatly  <br>00:57:45.599 received and um one of our client  <br>00:57:47.559 Investments was also won an award and  <br>00:57:49.839 Paul he was amazing um yeah it was funny  <br>00:57:54.240 I it was funny for me because I was so  <br>00:57:56.200 so far from Ireland and Ireland's a  <br>00:57:58.720 small place but it seems to get  <br>00:58:00.119 connected everywhere and we met with the  <br>00:58:01.720 ambassador to Ireland there and you know  <br>00:58:04.400 I wore a green tie on purpose and things  <br>00:58:06.440 like that you know my dad would have  <br>00:58:07.960 been proud and it was it was a nice it  <br>00:58:10.839 was a really nice uh occasion um when  <br>00:58:14.799 you when you win Awards I remember my  <br>00:58:17.319 first award was in 2003 I won best new  <br>00:58:19.839 internet ENT entrepreneur in Ireland H  <br>00:58:22.480 it was called the net Visionary award  <br>00:58:25.160 and uh on the night my parents were with  <br>00:58:28.039 me and I remember they said and the  <br>00:58:30.000 winter is I was sitting there my my  <br>00:58:31.880 probably rented tuxedo at the time and I  <br>00:58:34.559 remember my my my um fingers crossed  <br>00:58:37.240 like this and my head down and it was  <br>00:58:38.760 they were going through you know the  <br>00:58:39.880 finalists and a little profile of them  <br>00:58:42.400 and the winner is and I remember getting  <br>00:58:44.000 hit by this kind of wave of loneliness  <br>00:58:46.520 like nobody was going through this with  <br>00:58:48.000 me this wasn't significant for anyone  <br>00:58:49.640 else except for me and I remember  <br>00:58:52.680 carrying that feeling up on the side one  <br>00:58:54.319 and I I remember carrying that feeling  <br>00:58:55.480 up on the stage just going who that that  <br>00:58:57.440 actually feels really  <br>00:58:58.680 empty but those spider awards for  <br>00:59:01.599 example they I give credit to them  <br>00:59:04.160 completely to the staff that I worked  <br>00:59:05.880 with the teams that I worked with  <br>00:59:07.160 because I remember one of our clients we  <br>00:59:09.160 won a huge um spider award for them for  <br>00:59:12.599 best e-commerce  <br>00:59:14.680 in uh in England or the United Kingdom I  <br>00:59:17.319 think and it was a big deal and their  <br>00:59:19.280 marketing director was with us and she  <br>00:59:21.039 had a review the next day so I said here  <br>00:59:22.880 just walk in and plunk that on the desk  <br>00:59:25.160 so for them it was great stamps in their  <br>00:59:26.920 CV uh I think when you're when you're  <br>00:59:29.400 building  <br>00:59:31.000 companies you you only kind of you never  <br>00:59:33.680 really stop to to smell the roses you're  <br>00:59:35.760 always looking about you forget about  <br>00:59:37.440 what you've done well and you just focus  <br>00:59:38.799 on what of the next challenges and  <br>00:59:40.119 there's always more challenges right and  <br>00:59:41.680 there's always more things to do but  <br>00:59:43.680 those things they they force you to look  <br>00:59:46.480 around look look your teammates in the  <br>00:59:48.319 eye and toasted glass champ Pages we  <br>00:59:49.960 bloody dter and you know we have a ways  <br>00:59:52.319 to go yet but it's it's there's nice  <br>00:59:54.359 recognition um and some of the I I kept  <br>00:59:56.720 some of them just nostalgically um here  <br>00:59:59.520 as I say of nothing but I could a couple  <br>01:00:01.760 of those are in the office here in Dubai  <br>01:00:03.319 now as well is there something when you  <br>01:00:05.720 go back and and it doesn't matter which  <br>01:00:07.599 part of your life because it could be  <br>01:00:09.119 childhood as well but is there something  <br>01:00:11.920 that you weren't recognized for that  <br>01:00:14.960 still to this day sits in your mind and  <br>01:00:17.400 you wish you  <br>01:00:19.319 were uh I definitely being very honest  <br>01:00:24.200 and personal I definitely struggled for  <br>01:00:26.119 having an older brother really care for  <br>01:00:28.000 me and I definitely noticed that it  <br>01:00:30.079 meant that I responded to older people  <br>01:00:32.039 better which I think became a strength  <br>01:00:34.280 over time but but back then you just  <br>01:00:36.720 wanted your older brother to you know  <br>01:00:38.160 rub your hair and say he loved you and  <br>01:00:39.440 so on and we never had that relationship  <br>01:00:41.400 unfortunately um and even I remember  <br>01:00:44.079 seeing in school reports it would say I  <br>01:00:47.400 didn't really care about my peer  <br>01:00:50.000 feedback I was looking for the teachers  <br>01:00:52.000 feedback or you know U supervisors or  <br>01:00:54.359 things like that and uh you know in  <br>01:00:56.880 whatever way we get a we become a  <br>01:00:59.000 patchwork quilt as as I me our kind of  <br>01:01:01.920 construct over time that was certainly  <br>01:01:04.119 something I was I was more comfortable  <br>01:01:05.720 and more interested in older people  <br>01:01:08.359 generally um and I I think it it kind of  <br>01:01:11.079 worked like at 21 I was presenting in  <br>01:01:12.760 the boardrooms of IBM in Dublin and  <br>01:01:15.240 purely because I could create PowerPoint  <br>01:01:16.720 it wasn't because of my great great  <br>01:01:18.240 strategic thoughts I could just make it  <br>01:01:19.680 look Do  <br>01:01:20.680 It um and but I learned a lot about  <br>01:01:23.240 politics I learned a lot about you know  <br>01:01:25.359 middle Mar management you know silos of  <br>01:01:28.880 power and protection and all that kind  <br>01:01:30.160 of stuff and and I really really fought  <br>01:01:31.760 to make sure there was no politics or  <br>01:01:33.280 in any company I was involved  <br>01:01:35.200 with or anything that I built and even  <br>01:01:37.640 now if you looked at our our dni team  <br>01:01:40.440 we've we've got three teams in continus  <br>01:01:42.039 with have a partners team the the  <br>01:01:43.319 disruption intelligence team and then  <br>01:01:44.799 what we call client Partners who are the  <br>01:01:46.880 main principles of anything we invest in  <br>01:01:49.520 but when you look at the dni team which  <br>01:01:51.000 is our kind of Secret Sauce that's a  <br>01:01:53.079 circular team where they're all facing  <br>01:01:54.279 each other and the process goes through  <br>01:01:56.000 the middle of them their our lenses on  <br>01:01:57.720 the world and their job is to be a  <br>01:02:00.200 rising tide to anything they touch and  <br>01:02:02.799 we get to include them we get to bring  <br>01:02:05.839 them along on our journey we we we can  <br>01:02:07.839 focus on making them wealthy over time  <br>01:02:09.680 because we can make them shareholders of  <br>01:02:11.319 the things we invest in if they're  <br>01:02:13.599 subject matter experts in those areas we  <br>01:02:15.440 can we've our internal share a scheme so  <br>01:02:18.039 they their job is to be good for society  <br>01:02:21.200 is to bring the next generation of  <br>01:02:23.279 business of of an ethical investment  <br>01:02:25.920 it's not all ethical Essence we're not  <br>01:02:27.839 Saints either it's not our mandate it  <br>01:02:29.799 just happens to really suit how we see  <br>01:02:32.279 the  <br>01:02:33.000 world but they're a very motivated  <br>01:02:35.119 talented team that um it's a privilege  <br>01:02:38.400 when you get to handpick everyone you  <br>01:02:39.640 work with so you you can't take that  <br>01:02:41.880 privilege for granted you have to really  <br>01:02:43.680 really focus on that and make it about  <br>01:02:45.599 them not make it about you so even in my  <br>01:02:48.480 last uh in my last instance as as  <br>01:02:52.240 CEO um I did this um murf business  <br>01:02:56.359 school leadership training thing and to  <br>01:02:58.160 do this psychometric testing very very  <br>01:03:00.400 intense prism psychometric testing and I  <br>01:03:03.599 just gave I gave it to all the senior  <br>01:03:05.640 team and I said There You Go warts and  <br>01:03:07.440 all very vulnerable thing to do but  <br>01:03:09.359 again you know I said the better you  <br>01:03:12.160 understand this the better you can use  <br>01:03:13.160 me as a business tool so that's if you  <br>01:03:16.160 see my eyes rolling in the back of my  <br>01:03:17.640 head it's because of that weed Point not  <br>01:03:19.079 because it's me you know but to them  <br>01:03:21.640 they got the point is just like okay  <br>01:03:22.880 this is a very Frank relationship we're  <br>01:03:24.359 having here and it's the one thing I  <br>01:03:25.839 insist on with the guys we work with is  <br>01:03:28.200 be very direct be very Frank don't coat  <br>01:03:30.799 sugarcoat things because if you get this  <br>01:03:33.000 decision wrong for us we're in a lovely  <br>01:03:35.720 environment it's it's a a privileged air  <br>01:03:38.160 and and we get to work with amazing  <br>01:03:39.599 talent and so on but for the  <br>01:03:41.760 entrepreneurs coming through the the  <br>01:03:43.440 place quite often private equity and  <br>01:03:45.520 Venture Capital they go you oh you want  <br>01:03:47.160 our a couple of million Kiss the Ring  <br>01:03:48.640 here and so on but if you think of the  <br>01:03:52.319 emotional Journey a lot of entrepreneurs  <br>01:03:54.039 go through this could be their one Moon  <br>01:03:55.960 they could have given up the day job  <br>01:03:57.359 spent their savings and they arrive  <br>01:03:59.279 exhausted at our door so we say they're  <br>01:04:02.400 our customer and and treat them with  <br>01:04:04.559 emotional intelligence it is it's a it's  <br>01:04:06.640 a human game but you you have to treat  <br>01:04:10.400 them with emotional intelligence even if  <br>01:04:12.039 you know you're dealing with somebody  <br>01:04:13.359 who's brilliant and heavily on the  <br>01:04:15.319 Spectrum and you look at them and  <br>01:04:16.960 they're lightning in a jar and they just  <br>01:04:19.119 can't express themselves to you you  <br>01:04:20.760 still have to make it about you to  <br>01:04:22.520 connect with them and I think that's a  <br>01:04:24.599 very worthy challenge particularly when  <br>01:04:26.680 you have all these different lenses that  <br>01:04:28.440 mean we need to connect to that person  <br>01:04:30.079 in different ways to make them  <br>01:04:32.079 potentially successful investing is a  <br>01:04:34.200 very very Risky Business particularly  <br>01:04:35.760 with startups so what we're doing is  <br>01:04:37.559 trying to drisk that by creating fully  <br>01:04:40.119 evolved CEOs through that journey and if  <br>01:04:42.839 not we reserve the right typically in  <br>01:04:45.359 our structures to bring them on the  <br>01:04:47.279 journey but if we say look we need to  <br>01:04:48.559 put a CEO above you and you focus on  <br>01:04:51.440 your strength your power and this person  <br>01:04:53.119 will be a commercial person they'll  <br>01:04:54.520 worry about the day today you just focus  <br>01:04:57.799 on your Brilliance and let's bring that  <br>01:04:59.240 out of you you're still making it about  <br>01:05:01.079 them it's still a a learning experience  <br>01:05:03.680 for them and uh you know as I would say  <br>01:05:06.680 we're building a a wall Garden of trees  <br>01:05:09.839 okay and some of those trees will bear  <br>01:05:11.079 fruit some won't they'll die in the vine  <br>01:05:13.200 others will grow roots for five years  <br>01:05:14.760 and then suddenly spring up you just  <br>01:05:16.200 never know what the the mix of trees is  <br>01:05:19.359 going to be and they all need nurturing  <br>01:05:20.720 they all need care in different ways um  <br>01:05:23.039 and it once you put those entrepreneurs  <br>01:05:25.039 at the center that process I think  <br>01:05:27.200 you're you're kind of drisking the  <br>01:05:31.400 journey I get this  <br>01:05:34.680 sense that there's something you're  <br>01:05:36.640 trying to  <br>01:05:38.760 prove to some I don't know what and but  <br>01:05:44.200 your brother keeps coming up in my mind  <br>01:05:46.520 and I don't know why yeah well I mean  <br>01:05:48.799 you we've talked about him today I think  <br>01:05:52.400 um I think uh it's it's probably fresh  <br>01:05:56.240 cuz he passed away last year um it was  <br>01:05:58.640 he was quite unwell but he had an  <br>01:06:00.680 accident before he broke 18 bones fell  <br>01:06:02.599 out of a tree and so on so I was  <br>01:06:03.960 involved in helping him in in his life  <br>01:06:05.760 and sponsoring some part of his life  <br>01:06:07.760 even though we didn't really have a  <br>01:06:08.960 connection but it was just a in my head  <br>01:06:12.440 it's not this big emotional Gap now it's  <br>01:06:15.319 just a shame it's just a bloody shame  <br>01:06:16.960 let have gone for pin or more but the  <br>01:06:18.920 fact of the matter was he'd ring me  <br>01:06:20.039 whenever he needed money or we'd have  <br>01:06:22.640 the same conversation every time you  <br>01:06:24.640 know seemed like a nice guy his friends  <br>01:06:27.400 in where he lived in Florida loved him I  <br>01:06:30.680 even met one girl who who claimed that  <br>01:06:32.400 she saved his life when she was 12 he  <br>01:06:33.960 stopped her from drowning so I'm like he  <br>01:06:36.079 seemed to have a great life there he  <br>01:06:37.640 just didn't have it with us he left when  <br>01:06:39.240 he was 19 never came back to Ireland  <br>01:06:41.440 never left America again never did email  <br>01:06:44.359 never had a smartphone he was just  <br>01:06:45.760 really removed did gardening for a  <br>01:06:48.119 living and uh I just hop that he was  <br>01:06:50.400 very very happy in that he just didn't  <br>01:06:52.440 seem to need the connections with us you  <br>01:06:54.160 know and it's just a  <br>01:06:56.359 it's it's uh there's that kind of thing  <br>01:06:59.319 of healing through understanding you  <br>01:07:00.559 sort of go okay I know what it was more  <br>01:07:02.880 importantly I understand what it wasn't  <br>01:07:04.240 and possibly some of the reasons for  <br>01:07:05.599 that it's just a Pity I think we would  <br>01:07:07.599 have had some fun together and uh I  <br>01:07:09.520 think he would have enjoyed the journey  <br>01:07:11.400 uh a little bit more you know but I  <br>01:07:13.200 think the same about my dad my dad  <br>01:07:14.520 passed away three years ago and  <br>01:07:17.960 sometimes now like I kind of you know  <br>01:07:20.039 and like yeah Dad I'm on stage in the  <br>01:07:21.720 assembly in ker getting an award for  <br>01:07:23.319 being a global person I'm a big deal in  <br>01:07:25.520 South career now and my dad would would  <br>01:07:27.520 have reveled in that you know he really  <br>01:07:29.079 did and so would my mom so uh yeah it's  <br>01:07:32.160 just about you know you look back but  <br>01:07:34.160 you don't stare is is kind of how I look  <br>01:07:36.359 at it and you you um you bring the  <br>01:07:39.319 people that you care about along in this  <br>01:07:41.000 journey and you're hopefully open and  <br>01:07:43.279 sensitive to them the language you use  <br>01:07:45.279 should be uh blending with people not  <br>01:07:48.240 conflicting with them and uh you know  <br>01:07:50.359 every day is a a learning experience  <br>01:07:52.400 with different people and and the  <br>01:07:54.799 privilege of this job is I meet so many  <br>01:07:56.880 diverse kind of people I mean  <br>01:07:59.000 even on our dni team I think there's  <br>01:08:01.240 about 24 languages on the team and I  <br>01:08:03.680 think that's a great symbol of of of  <br>01:08:05.760 success and and and I don't mean  <br>01:08:07.559 diversity for diversity's sake this  <br>01:08:09.319 isn't like quota building in in a  <br>01:08:11.599 America or something it's just like it  <br>01:08:13.680 takes a certain kind of person to leave  <br>01:08:16.000 where they lived and and they're  <br>01:08:17.560 comfortable or it's safe and their  <br>01:08:19.040 family may be there to go somewhere else  <br>01:08:21.279 to work their ass off and you know you  <br>01:08:24.279 see that in the Middle East and  <br>01:08:25.960 particularly in Dubai in in in to such  <br>01:08:28.679 an extreme that I get so excited by the  <br>01:08:31.198 people I've met and the people have  <br>01:08:32.399 hired and even I've often found recently  <br>01:08:35.439 you know there there's been some jobs we  <br>01:08:37.158 filled and I'm like oh I wish we had  <br>01:08:39.679 three slots because I I find it very  <br>01:08:41.960 hard to to pick from those three people  <br>01:08:43.520 I hate to walk away from talent but we  <br>01:08:45.920 also have we're building out an agency  <br>01:08:47.439 one of our investments and we'll have  <br>01:08:48.960 200 people there by Christmas of next  <br>01:08:50.560 year I'm like oh let's genuinely keep in  <br>01:08:53.399 touch because I'll have a thing for you  <br>01:08:55.479 just not yet or just not for this team  <br>01:08:57.238 you know um and that's great that's you  <br>01:08:59.880 know so am I trying to prove  <br>01:09:02.799 anything no I think I think one of the  <br>01:09:05.359 reasons I moved here was for a big  <br>01:09:06.880 worthy challenge I wasn't about to go  <br>01:09:08.600 into business again life was pretty  <br>01:09:10.319 comfortable and I I didn't you know I  <br>01:09:13.479 wanted a big Market with a meaningful  <br>01:09:15.560 purpose and a real a big big audacious  <br>01:09:19.080 Challenge and my God we have we got  <br>01:09:22.560 us last question before I finish sir  <br>01:09:31.600 who do you care that you want to make  <br>01:09:34.759 proud of you who do I care oh my kids  <br>01:09:39.679 definitely um you want to be uh  <br>01:09:43.120 shoulders for them you know you want  <br>01:09:44.479 have you know you want to  <br>01:09:47.279 uh you want to have gone through your  <br>01:09:49.399 struggles in a way that when they look  <br>01:09:51.560 at what you went through um they can see  <br>01:09:54.920 that the journey and you know I I often  <br>01:09:58.600 say you know my wife to my wife and I  <br>01:10:01.239 say look we've done well but the kids  <br>01:10:05.159 are broke and we want them to learn to  <br>01:10:07.159 smell blood on their own because that  <br>01:10:09.440 kind of strength and resilience is a  <br>01:10:11.080 gift you give yourself you earn it over  <br>01:10:13.000 time and I'd really want that for them  <br>01:10:16.400 um I it there's very little else  <br>01:10:18.840 important to me you know some very close  <br>01:10:21.040 friends a an interesting and momentum of  <br>01:10:24.159 life and and you know My Little Secret  <br>01:10:27.520 Garden of Love and and and kids and so  <br>01:10:29.480 on and and that's kind of it you know  <br>01:10:31.320 it's it's you know you talk about  <br>01:10:33.520 detaching from stuff earlier yeah I've  <br>01:10:36.600 been I've been at occasions where you're  <br>01:10:38.679 trying to be all things to all people  <br>01:10:40.040 particularly when you're bootstrapping a  <br>01:10:41.840 an agency in an at in Ireland you know  <br>01:10:44.199 you kind of you're you're trying to be  <br>01:10:45.960 everybody's best friend and you you  <br>01:10:47.679 become very protective of your energy  <br>01:10:49.440 because you don't have the funds to to  <br>01:10:51.960 go and build a big amazing teams like we  <br>01:10:54.000 do now and  <br>01:10:55.760 you share your energy with people  <br>01:10:58.120 because you have to bring them along  <br>01:10:59.880 with you on the  <br>01:11:01.120 journey like you're giving Junior people  <br>01:11:03.480 big titles because you can't afford the  <br>01:11:04.800 big person you're trying to bring them  <br>01:11:06.080 along and I find excuse me that my  <br>01:11:10.080 energy um there's kind of two things  <br>01:11:12.679 that that frustrate me instantly I have  <br>01:11:14.520 a slow fuse when it comes to temper but  <br>01:11:16.880 two things frustrate one is crazy  <br>01:11:18.440 drivers so you know uh  <br>01:11:22.560 Dubai pick the wrong place for that oh  <br>01:11:24.960 yeah I I sit in the back and I work and  <br>01:11:27.000 I just say let's go that way which suits  <br>01:11:29.040 me too it's it's you know but um and  <br>01:11:31.880 then simple things having to repeat  <br>01:11:34.080 myself uh like simple things that have  <br>01:11:36.560 one function they can't do it like if a  <br>01:11:38.120 toaster doesn't work you know clock the  <br>01:11:40.159 thing bread doesn't go down clock it  <br>01:11:41.600 again right goes o|## SUMMARY  <br>Colin Meagle discusses startup potential, digital transformation, and personal philosophies

<br>00:00:07.240 Amazon says to you or by the way do you  <br>00:00:09.040 want that diaper that follows you around  <br>00:00:11.000 all those websites it's because your  <br>00:00:12.280 data is being sold behind the scenes  <br>00:00:13.759 through Brokers the average person now  <br>00:00:15.679 apparently has an attention span of 8  <br>00:00:17.199 seconds and the last big attacks in  <br>00:00:19.080 terms of where people's data was stolen  <br>00:00:20.880 was because of human error data literacy  <br>00:00:22.680 is the worst it's ever been now let's  <br>00:00:24.599 talk about data but not in the way that  <br>00:00:27.119 you think these social media companies  <br>00:00:29.240 gather our dat data so that they can  <br>00:00:31.439 generate revenue from advertisers that  <br>00:00:33.920 want to advertise to people with  <br>00:00:35.879 specific parts of data in mind your data  <br>00:00:38.600 that you create is often duplicated so  <br>00:00:40.879 for example if you own three devices I  <br>00:00:43.200 own an Apple Watch Android phone all of  <br>00:00:45.440 these things I'm repeating the same data  <br>00:00:47.160 I can never connect it I can never pull  <br>00:00:48.800 it apart because it's living in  <br>00:00:50.239 different companies it's my data but  <br>00:00:52.079 it's separated now be prepared to have  <br>00:00:54.920 your mind blown I met Michael a week and  <br>00:00:57.840 a half ago spent an hour and a half with  <br>00:00:59.480 him and my head literally blew off so I  <br>00:01:02.760 know for sure it's going to have some

in the way that you  <br>00:01:19.040 think look these social media companies  <br>00:01:22.600 gather our data so that they can  <br>00:01:24.840 generate revenue from advertisers that  <br>00:01:27.320 want to advertise to people with  <br>00:01:29.479 specific parts of data in mind and that  <br>00:01:33.040 is really really profitable for these  <br>00:01:37.320 companies but why should they own our  <br>00:01:40.159 data why should they be in charge of our  <br>00:01:42.159 data why shouldn't we be in charge of  <br>00:01:44.640 our own data why shouldn't we make money  <br>00:01:47.159 from our own data and how can our own  <br>00:01:49.560 data help us live a healthier and  <br>00:01:52.759 happier life that is the question that  <br>00:01:55.520 Michael Clark is

<br>00:03:46.319 you know us the people unlike what web 2  <br>00:03:49.120 did where we often end up serving big  <br>00:03:51.720 tech companies check out the internet of  <br>00:03:53.680 people today and see how you can  <br>00:03:55.200 leverage their ecosystem I promise you  <br>00:03:57.400 it's worth the Time Michael thank you so  <br>00:04:00.239 much for coming to join us on the show  <br>00:04:01.400 today that's a pleasure to be here some  <br>00:04:03.360 of what you said to me when I first met  <br>00:04:05.079 you scared the hell out of me um some of  <br>00:04:08.159 it excited me and that's why I was  <br>00:04:09.879 really Keen to get you on the show and  <br>00:04:12.000 share with our audience today this  <br>00:04:15.360 fascinating world of data and to be  <br>00:04:18.199 honest with you most people are naive  <br>00:04:20.839 ignorant or or I just choose maybe not  <br>00:04:25.360 to want to know what's going on in the  <br>00:04:27.120 world these these flash terms that keep  <br>00:04:28.960 being brought up now nowadays AI you  <br>00:04:30.919 know what does it mean and how can it  <br>00:04:32.360 Implement be implemented in your  <br>00:04:33.800 business you know Then followed with the  <br>00:04:35.800 chat GPT is the the the then the thing  <br>00:04:38.639 that's said and people don't really  <br>00:04:40.560 understand what's going on with that but  <br>00:04:42.360 one thing that I think that's really  <br>00:04:43.840 fascinating for me is that I as a  <br>00:04:46.120 content creator for many years have  <br>00:04:47.880 always been highly aware that these  <br>00:04:50.960 institutions these massive organizations  <br>00:04:53.039 the social media companies meta and  <br>00:04:55.199 Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok and  <br>00:04:57.400 Google and whatnot collect my data M and  <br>00:05:02.000 they collect it for their benefit Y and  <br>00:05:04.520 so that's the bit that I want to start  <br>00:05:06.360 out with you today okay I want to  <br>00:05:08.919 understand what you mean when you say  <br>00:05:11.759 they've got the data and it shouldn't be  <br>00:05:14.160 yours it should be yours yeah it's a  <br>00:05:16.360 really good point so when you when you  <br>00:05:18.120 think about what I think take a step  <br>00:05:19.880 back and ask yourself what data is  <br>00:05:22.080 that's the best place to start in a very  <br>00:05:23.600 non-technical way um I look at data as  <br>00:05:26.520 really our stories and our memories and  <br>00:05:28.960 our experiences so if you think about  <br>00:05:31.160 the photographs that you take the things  <br>00:05:33.440 that you want to keep they belong to you  <br>00:05:35.319 in a way but today they don't um you  <br>00:05:38.160 give them to others to look after um  <br>00:05:40.360 there's no insurance around what you  <br>00:05:41.720 hand over um so it could get lost at any  <br>00:05:44.199 moment um so if you start in that point  <br>00:05:46.400 and say okay if these are my stories and  <br>00:05:48.000 my memories how valuable are they to you  <br>00:05:51.039 because that's really where you should  <br>00:05:52.240 start and then you look at data in a  <br>00:05:54.240 very different way because today I think  <br>00:05:55.919 we've been brought up as you rightly say  <br>00:05:57.280 it's key to chat gbt um it's going to  <br>00:05:59.680 give you everything you want but if you  <br>00:06:01.360 break it down you know that's where you  <br>00:06:03.199 should start and say well actually data  <br>00:06:04.560 is personal to me and that's what it  <br>00:06:06.400 means and why shouldn't I own it um  <br>00:06:08.840 that's really the starting point in all  <br>00:06:10.120 of this so when we think about that then  <br>00:06:11.840 let's take some some some common example  <br>00:06:13.440 you say photographs so everything that  <br>00:06:15.919 that I produce as data so that can be  <br>00:06:19.039 stuff that I produce consciously but you  <br>00:06:21.199 know there'll be people that say I never  <br>00:06:22.400 use social media I don't produce data  <br>00:06:24.560 but for those people that think like  <br>00:06:26.120 that what type of data are they  <br>00:06:27.919 producing inadvertently that we can  <br>00:06:29.919 constitute in this conversation so think  <br>00:06:32.400 about how you got to the office this  <br>00:06:34.120 morning so Google Maps is a great  <br>00:06:36.199 example or any map software nopic on  <br>00:06:37.919 Google that journey to work generated  <br>00:06:40.479 data um unknown to you on your way to  <br>00:06:42.880 work you were  <br>00:06:44.080 commoditized because as you drive along  <br>00:06:46.960 people are now suddenly firing  <br>00:06:48.280 advertisements that you just say hey do  <br>00:06:49.680 you want to go to this place do you want  <br>00:06:50.759 to go to that place so even something as  <br>00:06:52.680 simple as driving to work is now making  <br>00:06:55.039 somebody else money but you never get  <br>00:06:57.000 access to that data yourself which you  <br>00:06:59.039 could have used for yourself um after  <br>00:07:01.400 the journey which is then you start  <br>00:07:03.680 thinking about it that way things start  <br>00:07:05.639 to get a bit more interesting because  <br>00:07:06.680 you start to ask yourself the question  <br>00:07:08.840 well what could I have done with that  <br>00:07:10.160 data if it was mine and why is it only  <br>00:07:12.680 being done this way okay that that's one  <br>00:07:16.000 of the big questions that we need to  <br>00:07:17.759 answer today give me some more examples  <br>00:07:20.759 that no not what you could do with it  <br>00:07:22.919 some examp like You' just given because  <br>00:07:24.199 I want to make sure that everyone's Can  <br>00:07:25.840 Be Touched by this so as soon as you  <br>00:07:27.759 just said that to me about Google Maps  <br>00:07:29.280 I'm like like I can go in and look at my  <br>00:07:31.000 map history and I can go and see all  <br>00:07:33.400 these different Journeys that I've taken  <br>00:07:35.080 even even if I've not put them into  <br>00:07:36.879 Google Maps corre so that that triggered  <br>00:07:40.000 me what give me another example of that  <br>00:07:41.919 so um even simple things like your Apple  <br>00:07:44.720 watch and things like that also think  <br>00:07:47.000 about it this way your data that you  <br>00:07:48.840 create is is often  <br>00:07:50.599 duplicated so for example if you own  <br>00:07:53.240 three devices I own an Apple Watch I own  <br>00:07:56.120 an Android phone all of these things I'm  <br>00:07:58.960 repeating the same data I can never  <br>00:08:00.599 connect it I can never pull it apart  <br>00:08:02.960 because it's living in different  <br>00:08:04.080 companies it's my data but it's  <br>00:08:06.159 separated so how many versions of you  <br>00:08:08.319 exist on a daily basis most people have  <br>00:08:10.159 about 100 passwords and don't realize it  <br>00:08:12.520 so your data is never connected which  <br>00:08:14.560 means you can never add to it which  <br>00:08:16.400 means you you're always repeating  <br>00:08:17.840 yourself almost so data is being sold  <br>00:08:20.639 constantly without you knowing behind  <br>00:08:22.159 the scenes but not only that you can't  <br>00:08:24.240 use it to solve your own problems let me  <br>00:08:26.199 explain to you what that means in very  <br>00:08:27.560 simple terms let's think about your  <br>00:08:29.120 health as a great example because we  <br>00:08:30.159 talked about this when we when we first  <br>00:08:31.599 met today not one person alive has a  <br>00:08:34.200 single view of their health um which  <br>00:08:36.519 means that we have all of these apps I  <br>00:08:38.120 have a whoop um a few people have an  <br>00:08:40.159 Apple Watch and so on but they're never  <br>00:08:41.559 connected they're never connected so it  <br>00:08:43.479 means we never get a really true picture  <br>00:08:45.880 of how our health is can we prevent  <br>00:08:47.839 things all of these things that we could  <br>00:08:49.640 if we owned our data and I think that's  <br>00:08:51.880 why ownership is really important  <br>00:08:53.320 because it's not about how much money I  <br>00:08:55.640 make from my data it's actually what it  <br>00:08:57.480 could mean for my life um how it could  <br>00:08:59.600 save my life um if I could connect that  <br>00:09:01.920 data myself wow okay so how do other  <br>00:09:05.920 companies use my data to make money this  <br>00:09:09.600 is like the hidden secret of the  <br>00:09:11.200 internet I think um and this kind of all  <br>00:09:13.519 started around 2003 um believe it or not  <br>00:09:16.399 in the marketing world Google bought  <br>00:09:18.440 AdSense and the internet before that was  <br>00:09:21.079 more of a library almost people  <br>00:09:23.120 connected communities so from like 2003  <br>00:09:25.680 where we are today a lot of then the  <br>00:09:27.760 data that we produce got sold um most  <br>00:09:30.200 people don't realize the way that Amazon  <br>00:09:32.959 says to you well by the way do you want  <br>00:09:34.680 that diaper that follows you around all  <br>00:09:36.720 those websites is because your data is  <br>00:09:38.440 being sold behind the scenes through  <br>00:09:39.839 Brokers and various other companies who  <br>00:09:42.000 are selling data every second to people  <br>00:09:44.399 who want that and a connecting bits of  <br>00:09:46.680 you to basically create that picture and  <br>00:09:49.240 create Revenue which is either for  <br>00:09:51.160 advertising and marketing for that  <br>00:09:52.640 company or data that other people would  <br>00:09:55.120 gladly purchase so they can understand  <br>00:09:57.000 your behavior to try and sell you  <br>00:09:58.839 another product  <br>00:09:59.959 right so let's let's take that as an  <br>00:10:01.240 example I'm a father let's say and I've  <br>00:10:03.160 got young children and I buy diapers  <br>00:10:05.440 okay the the the people that sell the  <br>00:10:07.160 diapers want to advertise to me because  <br>00:10:09.200 I buy the diapers and they can only do  <br>00:10:11.240 that by buying uh by advertising using  <br>00:10:13.399 the data that's sold to them essentially  <br>00:10:15.120 by Facebook and and other companies like  <br>00:10:16.959 that yeah yeah and also use the example  <br>00:10:18.360 in America there's well-known story that  <br>00:10:20.399 a child a girl got pregnant and didn't  <br>00:10:22.279 want to tell her parents but Amazon knew  <br>00:10:23.880 before her parents yes they collected  <br>00:10:26.120 all of the data about her and then they  <br>00:10:27.720 told the DAT Amazon told told her and  <br>00:10:29.839 then her parents found out from Amazon  <br>00:10:31.560 not their daughter because of how much  <br>00:10:33.600 data look as as time progresses we have  <br>00:10:36.600 you and I know we're going to talk about  <br>00:10:37.720 this is we'll have more data about us  <br>00:10:39.959 which will then build an even bigger  <br>00:10:41.440 picture about us and the question then  <br>00:10:43.079 is how much more control do we want  <br>00:10:45.120 about that because how personal it  <br>00:10:46.440 starts to become okay well this this for  <br>00:10:49.000 many people could be scary okay could be  <br>00:10:51.360 frightening first of all frightening the  <br>00:10:52.920 other people are using my data and I  <br>00:10:55.320 just take some simple examples that I'm  <br>00:10:57.160 sure that one or two viewers and  <br>00:10:58.720 listeners might be aware of an  <br>00:11:00.720 inappropriate photo yeah 100% you know  <br>00:11:03.079 an inappropriate photo of something  <br>00:11:05.240 intimate between you and your your wife  <br>00:11:06.839 or your husband that that piece of data  <br>00:11:09.040 you wouldn't want anybody else to see  <br>00:11:10.639 want but but actually there's lots of  <br>00:11:13.399 organizations that have access to it  <br>00:11:15.320 100% um that goes on on a daily basis um  <br>00:11:18.760 I use a term which is a bit  <br>00:11:19.880 controversial the way data storage is  <br>00:11:21.720 today is like unregulated  <br>00:11:23.279 banking um just give me let me sh me out  <br>00:11:26.240 and give you that comparison so today if  <br>00:11:28.240 I put 200 Durham or $20000 into a bank  <br>00:11:31.839 the bank insures me for that um they're  <br>00:11:34.519 also told what they can do with it  <br>00:11:36.320 usually is about 10 times the monetary  <br>00:11:37.839 value they can lend out and there's  <br>00:11:39.560 obviously other regulations and things  <br>00:11:41.000 and I can get it when I want subject to  <br>00:11:42.760 proving my identity and other factors if  <br>00:11:45.079 you think about your photographs today  <br>00:11:46.920 you will upload those but you're not  <br>00:11:48.920 insured if they're  <br>00:11:50.880 lost um and there are some privacy  <br>00:11:53.120 controls in terms of what these  <br>00:11:54.480 companies are allowed to do but they  <br>00:11:56.279 still can do other things if you commit  <br>00:11:57.959 and give your consent so the data  <br>00:11:59.760 related to those photographs can be used  <br>00:12:01.560 for monetization um and then afterwards  <br>00:12:04.040 then as long as you can prove who you  <br>00:12:05.200 are but sometimes they will lock you out  <br>00:12:06.560 anyway because you didn't give enough  <br>00:12:08.120 proof maybe you changed location that's  <br>00:12:09.800 happened to me personally so I always  <br>00:12:11.760 make the question what would be more  <br>00:12:12.920 important to you if your bank lost $200  <br>00:12:16.160 or a cloud provider lost 20 years of  <br>00:12:18.600 your  <br>00:12:19.440 photographs what would be more important  <br>00:12:21.279 to you now that's why I now think data  <br>00:12:24.639 is important to Everyday Life as water  <br>00:12:27.040 and I think data is more important than  <br>00:12:28.440 money because of that simple fact if you  <br>00:12:31.199 lost 20 years of your entire family  <br>00:12:33.320 because of mistake of a cloud provider  <br>00:12:35.320 with no insurance that would mean more  <br>00:12:37.320 to you personally I think than to any  <br>00:12:39.240 amount of money on this Earth good point  <br>00:12:42.639 okay so we know that these external  <br>00:12:45.639 organizations are monetizing the data  <br>00:12:47.680 that that they're gathering on us you  <br>00:12:49.959 you your essentially your belief is that  <br>00:12:53.720 you want to stop that and allow us to  <br>00:12:55.680 have the ownership of our own  <br>00:12:57.720 data so yes and no so um one is about  <br>00:13:01.839 Fair rewards so basically but I also  <br>00:13:05.240 want us to stop thinking about  <br>00:13:06.440 monetizing  <br>00:13:07.600 data because if we think of monetization  <br>00:13:10.399 of data as the answer to everything then  <br>00:13:12.399 that's we're losing sight of the power  <br>00:13:13.800 of data I think when you and I first met  <br>00:13:16.000 I use the term I think data is potential  <br>00:13:18.680 um because that's the other way I look  <br>00:13:19.760 at data it's the potential to innovate  <br>00:13:21.360 it's the potential to save lives and yes  <br>00:13:22.880 we'll make money from data but if that's  <br>00:13:24.959 our only lens on this then we're all  <br>00:13:27.079 missing out because I would even AR that  <br>00:13:29.680 even the ones today that make the money  <br>00:13:31.120 off our data have all missed out because  <br>00:13:33.720 they don't have a single view of our  <br>00:13:34.839 life they only have a version of our  <br>00:13:36.880 life so they can Amazon can only see my  <br>00:13:38.920 Amazon life they have no idea what I  <br>00:13:40.920 watch on Netflix for example so they're  <br>00:13:43.160 only building a version of me that they  <br>00:13:44.880 know so my argument is that if Apple  <br>00:13:48.519 could see all of my data and I allowed  <br>00:13:50.759 them to have it because I owned it it  <br>00:13:52.519 could be worth even more than they are  <br>00:13:53.839 today because they can give me utilities  <br>00:13:56.759 um to manage my health for example which  <br>00:13:58.360 connect all that data which we don't  <br>00:13:59.800 have today but also I could create my  <br>00:14:01.920 own utilities that help me manage my  <br>00:14:03.759 health or other things and yes of course  <br>00:14:05.639 I'll monetize my data which is a big  <br>00:14:07.720 part of the AI story today um where we  <br>00:14:10.079 know that a lot of people's data has  <br>00:14:11.480 being used to build AI without their  <br>00:14:13.000 knowledge but my argument is well we  <br>00:14:15.880 need Ai and AI needs us and a big part  <br>00:14:18.199 of that is also a fair reward for how  <br>00:14:20.199 our data has been used to create Ai and  <br>00:14:22.399 constantly how it's used so it's a  <br>00:14:23.839 mixture of the people who take our data  <br>00:14:26.639 today also getting benefit but more me  <br>00:14:29.440 as a consumer I also get a benefit  <br>00:14:31.720 because now what I'm using is a  <br>00:14:33.440 reflection of how unique I am and who I  <br>00:14:36.000 am rather than a generic view of  <br>00:14:38.959 myself if if you if if we take  <br>00:14:41.160 monetization and just park it for one  <br>00:14:42.759 minute and and and look at how those  <br>00:14:44.360 other companies use the data they're  <br>00:14:45.920 using the data so that it can be  <br>00:14:48.279 effective in certain ways the thing the  <br>00:14:49.839 thing that kind of resonates I'm curious  <br>00:14:51.519 about now is Health okay because that's  <br>00:14:54.880 the one thing that's the most important  <br>00:14:56.199 thing to all of us although some of us  <br>00:14:57.639 seem to be on a a mission of death a lot  <br>00:14:59.639 of the time um that bit that you said  <br>00:15:02.839 resonates me you you wear a whoop you  <br>00:15:04.560 know I wear a Garin and and and you've  <br>00:15:06.759 got your Apple watch and these two  <br>00:15:08.199 devices aren't talking to each other and  <br>00:15:10.279 that's just these two that are on your  <br>00:15:11.720 wrist let alone um all of the other  <br>00:15:14.399 information that's gathered about your  <br>00:15:16.040 health in different ways how can how can  <br>00:15:19.040 what you're proposing how can that help  <br>00:15:22.680 me so let me probably give a really I'm  <br>00:15:26.800 always open and honest with my my  <br>00:15:28.360 audience so recently um I was told you  <br>00:15:31.360 know you're at the age Spencer but you  <br>00:15:32.880 need to have a thumb put up your bum so  <br>00:15:34.639 that you can check your  <br>00:15:36.319 colon all right and I was like I  <br>00:15:38.360 probably been hearing that for five or  <br>00:15:39.759 six years and then someone who's a bit  <br>00:15:42.279 older than me a friend of mine he said  <br>00:15:43.800 to me said you need to get it done okay  <br>00:15:45.639 A friend of mine got sick he had some  <br>00:15:47.199 cancer blah blah blah you know you need  <br>00:15:48.480 to go and get it checked and so I was um  <br>00:15:51.440 I was reticent to go as I think most men  <br>00:15:53.519 are but I but I eventually conceded and  <br>00:15:55.720 went to the hospital here and um had a  <br>00:15:57.920 camera put where it shouldn't go and uh  <br>00:16:00.279 uh the work that was done to find out  <br>00:16:01.680 that I was all  <br>00:16:04.600 good that information  <br>00:16:07.639 there has impact on other information on  <br>00:16:11.160 other parts of my body and other parts  <br>00:16:12.600 of Health okay cancer is something that  <br>00:16:15.959 spreads into other parts of our body as  <br>00:16:17.560 an example when we when we own our own  <br>00:16:20.920 data are you suggesting that we're able  <br>00:16:24.319 essentially to combine all of this  <br>00:16:26.079 different information from the hospital  <br>00:16:28.000 that I went to here the American  <br>00:16:29.360 Hospital so the one five year or 10  <br>00:16:30.880 years ago I had my spinal surgery in  <br>00:16:32.560 London um to to the one where I had my  <br>00:16:35.279 my my clavicle done and the metal plate  <br>00:16:37.000 put in there when I fell off my bike at  <br>00:16:38.600 the medic Medicare place here um is it  <br>00:16:42.360 just Gathering all of that together and  <br>00:16:44.279 putting it in a place where there's that  <br>00:16:46.360 can be then read and understood and  <br>00:16:48.639 further diagnosis can be done to  <br>00:16:50.720 optimize my health correct and this is  <br>00:16:52.560 where the AI story comes in okay so  <br>00:16:55.240 today we've been told a narrative that  <br>00:16:57.160 AI is better than us right a lot of the  <br>00:16:59.360 narrative because it's created a divide  <br>00:17:01.000 in society right we have to admit that  <br>00:17:03.319 there's parts of the world that think  <br>00:17:04.480 it's going to solve everything we've  <br>00:17:06.000 ever had a problem with there's the  <br>00:17:07.760 other half of the world that are rightly  <br>00:17:08.959 concerned and think we're going to lose  <br>00:17:10.119 our jobs the reality is I think we're  <br>00:17:12.240 moving into an era of collaborative  <br>00:17:14.039 collaborative AI where humans and AI  <br>00:17:16.319 will work together but on people's own  <br>00:17:18.520 data so let's take your example um I  <br>00:17:21.760 work out quite a lot so when I first met  <br>00:17:23.799 my PT she knows nothing about me she  <br>00:17:26.160 only knows what I tell her yeah and then  <br>00:17:28.039 we figure that out through the sessions  <br>00:17:30.640 um it's lucky that she specializes in  <br>00:17:32.200 biomechanics so she can actually figure  <br>00:17:33.799 out as she goes along but wouldn't it be  <br>00:17:35.919 useful if you took all of that data that  <br>00:17:38.120 you've just collected and then you could  <br>00:17:40.120 show her where your injuries are what  <br>00:17:42.600 you have and then all a sudden then you  <br>00:17:44.160 get an excise program that's taken for  <br>00:17:45.679 you even your AI could probably say to  <br>00:17:48.480 you on all your data um hey Spencer um I  <br>00:17:51.760 can see all these injuries I can see  <br>00:17:53.200 bits about your nutrition maybe you want  <br>00:17:55.200 to think about XYZ because the reality  <br>00:17:57.559 is AI is not going to queue at cancer  <br>00:17:59.760 but with your own data might be able to  <br>00:18:01.360 prevent it because through predictions  <br>00:18:03.880 and patterns and past examples in your  <br>00:18:06.400 life I can bring all that data together  <br>00:18:08.400 and suddenly I have a different picture  <br>00:18:09.799 of you and this is the really important  <br>00:18:11.600 bit the way the AI is being developed  <br>00:18:13.520 today is trying to treat everybody the  <br>00:18:14.679 same with the way it reports and gives  <br>00:18:17.000 you Insight the reality is we're all  <br>00:18:18.480 unique the story you've just said is  <br>00:18:20.320 unique to you yeah so in a way only you  <br>00:18:23.360 can really self diagnose if because  <br>00:18:25.840 basically you'd have to go and see all  <br>00:18:26.919 of those doctors individually m someone  <br>00:18:29.440 who's amazing to piece that story  <br>00:18:31.120 together um but if you had all your data  <br>00:18:33.159 and AI was there all of a sudden now  <br>00:18:35.120 that story changes because what it's  <br>00:18:37.159 giving you advice on is what makes you  <br>00:18:39.440 unique which is those life events and  <br>00:18:41.799 that data effectively and we've  <br>00:18:44.039 established clearly now in the world not  <br>00:18:47.280 everybody's the same we know that people  <br>00:18:48.880 are different and so the same exercise  <br>00:18:50.440 program nutrition program or whatever it  <br>00:18:52.120 may be is not going to work on everyone  <br>00:18:54.400 how does how does that  <br>00:18:56.240 that how does that then get translated  <br>00:18:59.520 because if it's Gathering that  <br>00:19:00.679 information and it's suggesting it how  <br>00:19:03.200 is it suggesting it and and you know is  <br>00:19:05.000 it is it then providing that information  <br>00:19:06.960 to a holistic doctor that then says  <br>00:19:08.720 right I've understood everything now  <br>00:19:11.000 based upon all this information that's  <br>00:19:12.280 been gathered over the last 54 years of  <br>00:19:13.880 your life spener this is the direction  <br>00:19:16.039 you need to head in or is that going to  <br>00:19:17.600 be something that that that that that  <br>00:19:19.120 allows us to understand it so that we  <br>00:19:21.240 can then plan with it so this this opens  <br>00:19:23.200 up another question or at least an area  <br>00:19:25.480 of focus so a lot of the work that I've  <br>00:19:28.400 been doing doing in this space and it  <br>00:19:30.400 dawned on me that we also don't yet have  <br>00:19:33.240 the skills needed to interpret what AI  <br>00:19:35.080 is going to give us and and some of  <br>00:19:37.440 that's not our fault that's just our  <br>00:19:39.520 dependency on technology over time so we  <br>00:19:42.240 have to reason with ourselves and  <br>00:19:43.960 understand that we become visual  <br>00:19:45.559 thinkers um the average person now  <br>00:19:47.840 apparently has an attention span of 8  <br>00:19:49.559 seconds um the last big attacks in terms  <br>00:19:52.240 of where people's data was stolen was  <br>00:19:54.320 because of human error um and data  <br>00:19:56.559 literacy is the worst it's ever been so  <br>00:19:59.280 the the real value of ownership of data  <br>00:20:00.960 and I would argue treating data like an  <br>00:20:02.440 asset would mean children are now  <br>00:20:04.679 educated on how to read it how to think  <br>00:20:06.840 critically how to debate how to reason  <br>00:20:09.400 so that's the other reason that  <br>00:20:10.679 ownership of data is really important  <br>00:20:12.280 because then we will teach people how to  <br>00:20:14.440 read it um so look you're not I'm not  <br>00:20:16.720 saying you're going to replace your  <br>00:20:17.840 doctor but at least some of these things  <br>00:20:19.919 may give you advice which are not  <br>00:20:21.799 life-threatening and there will be a  <br>00:20:23.360 moment where we say well actually you  <br>00:20:24.559 probably should see a doctor because of  <br>00:20:26.559 what I can see but also your past  <br>00:20:28.080 history but you know what the thing the  <br>00:20:30.360 thing that sticks out for me more than  <br>00:20:31.799 anything else is is the whole preventing  <br>00:20:33.880 correct you know for me it's like if if  <br>00:20:36.360 people  <br>00:20:37.559 knew that they this data could help them  <br>00:20:41.360 prevent yeah getting cancer which  <br>00:20:43.559 impacts one in two people one or two  <br>00:20:45.120 women anyway um on this planet that that  <br>00:20:49.679 that  <br>00:20:52.760 literally will save more lives than a  <br>00:20:55.320 war on or apocalypse would ever take let  <br>00:20:57.520 me give you a real good example I met  <br>00:20:59.360 this lady on a plane I'm I'm sure she  <br>00:21:00.720 will remind me telling this story um I  <br>00:21:03.480 got in a plane and there was a lady  <br>00:21:05.039 opposite me very sitting in a very  <br>00:21:06.240 uncomfortable position um I she had  <br>00:21:08.360 pillows and towels and things and I  <br>00:21:10.279 asked her we got talking and I said why  <br>00:21:12.240 are you sat like that she said back  <br>00:21:13.679 cancer I said how did you find that out  <br>00:21:16.159 and she broke her back in the gym  <br>00:21:17.919 training um which was unusual because  <br>00:21:20.039 she was so young so the doctor analyzed  <br>00:21:22.480 unfortunately you've got back cancer and  <br>00:21:23.880 you're stage four right months and  <br>00:21:27.200 months and months later shakula  <br>00:21:29.400 doctors don't know how a mixture of what  <br>00:21:32.120 she thought she should do with medical  <br>00:21:34.520 advice but whatever it did it worked  <br>00:21:37.559 she's a life coach so I asked her I said  <br>00:21:39.640 well what did you do she said well I  <br>00:21:41.360 can't remember really but because I'm a  <br>00:21:43.240 life coach now people now want me to  <br>00:21:44.679 help them in a similar position and I  <br>00:21:46.880 said to her well if you owned your data  <br>00:21:49.720 you could have collected everything that  <br>00:21:51.039 you did and then wouldn't it be amazing  <br>00:21:53.799 if you could share that value with  <br>00:21:55.000 someone else you take your data set and  <br>00:21:57.520 you give it to someone who's got the  <br>00:21:58.720 same as you and their AI combines their  <br>00:22:01.480 data with your data and suddenly they  <br>00:22:03.760 find the answer that's unique to that  <br>00:22:05.840 individual based on your learnings and  <br>00:22:08.000 who's to say you then give that to a  <br>00:22:10.159 pharmaceutical company who then instead  <br>00:22:12.200 of generating a pill they generate  <br>00:22:15.000 everybody an algorithm so that everybody  <br>00:22:17.200 then can follow that and manage their  <br>00:22:18.440 own health in a similar condition that's  <br>00:22:20.720 what we're talking about we have enough  <br>00:22:22.679 data in the world and enough technology  <br>00:22:25.080 now to get us to a place where if we  <br>00:22:27.200 treat data like an asset we could  <br>00:22:29.440 prevent much more than just the health  <br>00:22:33.880 side  <br>00:22:36.200 wow but wow with a which begs the  <br>00:22:39.679 question why has this not already  <br>00:22:42.880 happened it makes me makes me feel sad  <br>00:22:45.799 that something as as as remarkable and  <br>00:22:48.880 impactful as that that there there are  <br>00:22:51.960 so many more things in the world that  <br>00:22:53.279 we're spending time money and effort on  <br>00:22:54.760 right now but that seems to me as like  <br>00:22:57.480 the biggest game changer the planet  <br>00:22:59.120 could ever face it's a it's a history  <br>00:23:01.679 that's often been Untold um we've I've  <br>00:23:04.880 sold it wow that's massive though isn't  <br>00:23:08.120 it it is I as I just start and process  <br>00:23:10.960 that I mean it's like that if you could  <br>00:23:14.159 actually do that so if you take that to  <br>00:23:16.080 its full end degree with the technology  <br>00:23:18.480 we're having now when you're born I  <br>00:23:20.679 could give you a digital twin of view  <br>00:23:23.120 and I could AB test you based on your  <br>00:23:25.520 own data and what your parents inherited  <br>00:23:27.360 to you as a piece of data so if you were  <br>00:23:29.200 born with diabetes for example and your  <br>00:23:31.559 parents had diabetes or one of them  <br>00:23:33.360 throughout their life and they pass on  <br>00:23:35.360 that data belongs to them so they would  <br>00:23:37.520 give it to you as an inheritance and  <br>00:23:40.240 then you could run that on the AI which  <br>00:23:42.039 could be 20 years later digital twin  <br>00:23:44.200 technology exist where you can take a  <br>00:23:45.679 replica of a machine today I could take  <br>00:23:47.400 a replica R you and then use the same  <br>00:23:49.799 data to see what medication would work  <br>00:23:51.360 before I even give it to you that's a  <br>00:23:53.400 10year vision that is completely  <br>00:23:55.320 possible um but again you've got to  <br>00:23:57.640 start with not the technology and this  <br>00:23:59.559 goes back to your question why don't we  <br>00:24:00.919 have it now is because our focus is in  <br>00:24:03.039 the wrong place we see the technology as  <br>00:24:05.880 the answer but the real power has been  <br>00:24:07.480 there all along which is the data the  <br>00:24:09.799 identity and the value it  <br>00:24:11.760 generates so the more we SP Focus Less  <br>00:24:14.559 on technology and more on data what I'm  <br>00:24:17.400 describing is just literally scratching  <br>00:24:19.480 the surface health is just one example  <br>00:24:21.880 you you go on and on in terms of what we  <br>00:24:23.640 can see because the other problem is  <br>00:24:26.399 Spencer we've been brought up to believe  <br>00:24:27.720 that data means  <br>00:24:28.880 monetization but actually data is a  <br>00:24:31.000 utility and a store value at exactly the  <br>00:24:33.000 same time what does that mean well one I  <br>00:24:35.000 can use it to make money for myself if  <br>00:24:36.919 an AI uses my algorithm I'll get paid  <br>00:24:38.760 many times over which is great but the  <br>00:24:40.799 other amazing thing for me is I can use  <br>00:24:43.440 the create utilities I've just  <br>00:24:45.440 described um imagine you've got an AI  <br>00:24:47.720 with your data and suddenly it says to  <br>00:24:49.720 you Spencer you can see you've got a  <br>00:24:51.080 health app but you're missing some data  <br>00:24:53.240 that would help you why don't you go to  <br>00:24:55.000 a hike in some far off country you rest  <br>00:24:59.080 but you'll collect dat that's really  <br>00:25:00.600 valuable to others and you and you could  <br>00:25:03.240 sell that on an exchange and make some  <br>00:25:05.120 money for yourself but at the same time  <br>00:25:07.120 it would build a bigger picture of your  <br>00:25:08.520 health but improve your cardiovascular  <br>00:25:10.799 system it's like sold why wouldn't you  <br>00:25:13.760 yeah absolutely yeah gee man it's just  <br>00:25:18.000 like it's so exciting it's like it's  <br>00:25:22.159 like okay a lot of time a lot of time  <br>00:25:25.320 it's always about how can it be  <br>00:25:27.279 implemented okay you know what what are  <br>00:25:29.120 the practical steps of being implemented  <br>00:25:31.120 so I know that you've put some thought  <br>00:25:32.720 into this that's why you're sat here  <br>00:25:34.120 today but um tell me what when you had  <br>00:25:37.799 these realizations and the were these  <br>00:25:39.559 moments for you big moments like they  <br>00:25:41.159 are for as I'm listening to it now they  <br>00:25:42.919 they were yeah so so the story with this  <br>00:25:44.799 goes back four years I was asked to  <br>00:25:46.360 write a paper a very long time ago on  <br>00:25:48.520 what the future of data would be in 2030  <br>00:25:51.279 and I I kind of had those he in the  <br>00:25:52.760 moment you know here standing up moments  <br>00:25:54.320 in a room where it's was like it dawned  <br>00:25:56.279 on me this was much more important that  <br>00:25:57.960 I'd be asked to do um but it also dawned  <br>00:26:01.760 on me we need to do more um and we need  <br>00:26:05.600 to know more about this and that's kind  <br>00:26:07.640 of what started the journey I think we  <br>00:26:09.399 all have these moments where we find  <br>00:26:10.919 something or we start something and it  <br>00:26:12.320 gets bigger than ourselves this is what  <br>00:26:14.320 it became so yeah they then what I'm  <br>00:26:16.760 doing and what I've been have done is  <br>00:26:19.279 doing exactly what you just asked which  <br>00:26:21.000 is the steps to get there either for a  <br>00:26:23.080 government to put this in place so some  <br>00:26:25.080 of these longer term or even near term  <br>00:26:26.840 Things become a reality  <br>00:26:28.960 but also what are the fundamental things  <br>00:26:31.559 that we need in this but also not  <br>00:26:32.919 forgetting the role that people play in  <br>00:26:34.279 all of this which I think is close to  <br>00:26:36.159 your heart everyone we met as well  <br>00:26:37.399 talking about people and organizations  <br>00:26:38.960 and their roles and I'm sure we'll come  <br>00:26:40.919 on to that is their importance in it so  <br>00:26:42.799 yeah the the the steps are really  <br>00:26:44.039 important I can go through some of those  <br>00:26:45.840 if absolutely we need to go I want to be  <br>00:26:48.880 I want make sure everybody not only sits  <br>00:26:51.039 there and has just done what I've done  <br>00:26:52.480 as you've explained what you explained  <br>00:26:53.760 but you know what are these what are  <br>00:26:55.440 these moves that we need to make so if  <br>00:26:57.200 you think about so what makes ownership  <br>00:26:59.000 possible obviously starts with the  <br>00:27:00.720 regulator and the government um I'm  <br>00:27:03.279 fortunate to be living in Dubai and I  <br>00:27:04.919 can have those conversations and it's  <br>00:27:07.640 exciting and it probably won't surprise  <br>00:27:09.600 you how open they are to those  <br>00:27:11.240 conversations the first step in anything  <br>00:27:13.080 is recognizing people's legal right to  <br>00:27:14.600 own their data that's that's the first  <br>00:27:15.960 big tick um we mustn't underestimate the  <br>00:27:18.480 role of your identity with that because  <br>00:27:20.399 you are your data and that's how you  <br>00:27:21.760 prove yourself so those two are  <br>00:27:23.559 critically important I think then  <br>00:27:25.480 there's the awareness like this podcast  <br>00:27:27.799 is giv people that awareness but I think  <br>00:27:29.880 then regulators and other organizations  <br>00:27:31.520 then will have to make people aware of  <br>00:27:32.880 what that means in the near term people  <br>00:27:35.520 can help themselves um they can actually  <br>00:27:38.600 think more clearly about what they do  <br>00:27:40.279 with their data in the short term maybe  <br>00:27:42.360 work with companies where they can  <br>00:27:43.720 access their data and use it themselves  <br>00:27:46.600 um and just become more Curious over  <br>00:27:48.840 time some of the work I'm doing is  <br>00:27:50.679 helping build the curriculums for  <br>00:27:52.320 schools in terms of how children now can  <br>00:27:54.519 become critical thinkers again and learn  <br>00:27:57.080 to reason so then they will be in a  <br>00:27:58.720 position to actually use their data with  <br>00:28:00.480 an AI in the right way um but the  <br>00:28:03.480 biggest thing you know that's what you  <br>00:28:04.519 can do as individual and that's what  <br>00:28:05.600 needs to be done at a government level  <br>00:28:07.200 there's a raft of technology behind all  <br>00:28:08.919 of this I'm very fortunate to be working  <br>00:28:10.600 with people on those um but yeah that's  <br>00:28:12.679 your starting point one is educate  <br>00:28:14.200 yourself and build an awareness of these  <br>00:28:16.360 things and also ask yourself the  <br>00:28:18.200 question why and what could I do and the  <br>00:28:20.279 second part of the equation is  <br>00:28:21.320 unfortunately we can't do anything until  <br>00:28:23.279 the government gives us a helping hand  <br>00:28:24.720 and that's part of the work that I'm  <br>00:28:25.720 doing when you talk to governments about  <br>00:28:27.919 a subject matter like this do they  <br>00:28:30.039 immediately jump on it and say we get it  <br>00:28:32.039 we understand it we want to try and do  <br>00:28:33.440 something about it or do you get um for  <br>00:28:36.360 obvious reasons I would suspect push  <br>00:28:38.240 back a little bit of push back but  <br>00:28:40.399 that's only because I think the way that  <br>00:28:42.760 we've been taught what data is so we've  <br>00:28:46.080 touched on that we've been taught data  <br>00:28:47.640 is monetization we've also been taught  <br>00:28:49.880 that data is  <br>00:28:50.960 fear which is where data privacy comes  <br>00:28:53.320 from yeah so people have been I guess  <br>00:28:56.279 told it's scary to share your look after  <br>00:28:58.799 it don't use it so then we constantly  <br>00:29:01.679 have privacy rules when actually that's  <br>00:29:03.320 probably not the answer the answer is  <br>00:29:05.440 now ownership in Choice which is the  <br>00:29:07.600 conversation I have with the regulator  <br>00:29:09.000 to say look let's be realistic we're  <br>00:29:11.279 going to have an AI fairly soon that no  <br>00:29:13.080 one's ever going to be able to keep up  <br>00:29:14.200 with they the regulator so do we  <br>00:29:16.559 actually then say maybe there's a  <br>00:29:18.320 different model which is we give people  <br>00:29:20.399 the ownership and choice we give them  <br>00:29:21.799 the technology to do that and maybe the  <br>00:29:24.080 regulator then shifts their attention to  <br>00:29:25.679 what really matters which is security  <br>00:29:27.159 and ethics and then the game changes but  <br>00:29:30.320 then more importantly you talk to the  <br>00:29:31.720 regulator around look this isn't about  <br>00:29:33.720 monetization this is about giving people  <br>00:29:35.279 the things they've never had I would  <br>00:29:36.679 even argue what even businesses have  <br>00:29:38.480 never had and if you bring this into  <br>00:29:41.640 fruition you will open up innovation in  <br>00:29:43.919 a national level National level because  <br>00:29:46.320 you will now invite fex companies who  <br>00:29:49.399 will help people and businesses use data  <br>00:29:52.159 in the way that I'm describing so you  <br>00:29:53.840 create an ecosystem and an economy  <br>00:29:55.399 around this that's why it's exciting for  <br>00:29:57.320 the regulator because now you create a  <br>00:29:58.799 culture of innovation but also you  <br>00:30:00.919 create a new Workforce you build the  <br>00:30:03.760 Next Generation and you almost build you  <br>00:30:06.000 know the underpinnings of of a new way  <br>00:30:11.200 forward how cool is  <br>00:30:13.480 that talk to me about how you link the  <br>00:30:16.360 blockchain with the ambition here  <br>00:30:19.080 because I think that and again let's  <br>00:30:20.519 just make sure that there'll be there'll  <br>00:30:22.000 be people here that don't understand  <br>00:30:23.159 really what the blockchain has said I  <br>00:30:24.519 don't want to jump too too deep into  <br>00:30:26.679 that but I want people to to understand  <br>00:30:29.240 the connection because we just had uh in  <br>00:30:31.440 the Press yesterday uh an announcement  <br>00:30:33.840 that M2 is going to allow people to um  <br>00:30:37.360 uh trade trade their uh ethereum and  <br>00:30:39.919 Bitcoin in their local currency in their  <br>00:30:41.919 bank accounts here the government of Abu  <br>00:30:43.519 Dhabi have just to authorize that which  <br>00:30:45.519 I think will you know less and more and  <br>00:30:49.640 more take people to less and less fear  <br>00:30:51.480 around the whole world of crypto because  <br>00:30:53.760 it's becoming normalized and we heard  <br>00:30:55.720 what Trump's saying if he gets back into  <br>00:30:57.159 Power what he's going to do as well so  <br>00:30:59.159 that's I I hope bringing more people  <br>00:31:01.159 into this place of not thinking that you  <br>00:31:03.559 know crypto is some crazy nutty scam and  <br>00:31:06.320 and the blockchain and web3 is uh is  <br>00:31:08.279 Bonkers so just in really simple terms  <br>00:31:11.880 how are you doing what you're doing  <br>00:31:13.600 there so you've used the magic words so  <br>00:31:15.799 bit Bonkers no that is also a magic word  <br>00:31:18.360 because you haveed Bonkers to put the  <br>00:31:19.559 pieces together um so Bitcoin and  <br>00:31:22.639 ethereum I look at data as the brother  <br>00:31:25.080 and sister of both of them because  <br>00:31:27.240 Bitcoin is a story value MH ethereum is  <br>00:31:29.880 programmable data is  <br>00:31:31.960 both so what if you made data a  <br>00:31:34.679 token itself and what if you could store  <br>00:31:38.039 it on a ledger in terms of every time  <br>00:31:40.440 it's used who has it because that's  <br>00:31:42.039 really what the blockchain is right it's  <br>00:31:43.279 a mutable record of something that was  <br>00:31:45.760 stored in a ledger like in the olden  <br>00:31:48.000 days where we'd have a be some you know  <br>00:31:49.480 Ledger ins and outs big books big books  <br>00:31:51.760 right the lines in exactly now now now  <br>00:31:53.799 it's digital um and the currency is is  <br>00:31:56.720 is data uh my argument is the currency  <br>00:31:59.279 now is intelligence because actually  <br>00:32:01.600 what we're sharing is knowledge and I  <br>00:32:03.240 can tokenize it and I can store in a  <br>00:32:05.320 blockchain okay so let's let's just Dum  <br>00:32:07.440 that down a little bit okay tokenize it  <br>00:32:09.720 so we can create a a Bitcoin 2.0 or we  <br>00:32:12.799 can we can whatever we want to call it  <br>00:32:14.919 okay let's let's call it let's call it  <br>00:32:17.200 whatever we want but it essentially  <br>00:32:19.120 becomes its very own token that sits  <br>00:32:22.559 alongside all of the other tokens as as  <br>00:32:24.760 an asset that you can buy and trade and  <br>00:32:28.720 that that data itself then each each  <br>00:32:31.919 piece of data is owned by whoever the  <br>00:32:33.559 owner is correct and his access for a  <br>00:32:35.639 wallet that you hold the word asset  <br>00:32:38.639 though is what you said is really  <br>00:32:39.919 important um because a lot of the work  <br>00:32:42.000 I'm doing is making data into a real  <br>00:32:43.639 world asset so treating it like water so  <br>00:32:47.600 if you think of the outage that happened  <br>00:32:49.159 a few weeks ago or a week ago now isn't  <br>00:32:50.880 it um where you know major system change  <br>00:32:54.120 for the first time I guess locked us all  <br>00:32:55.880 out of our computers okay so the so for  <br>00:32:58.360 people that that aren't familiar with it  <br>00:32:59.919 here in the world recently if you're  <br>00:33:01.720 under under a rock we had they said  <br>00:33:04.639 someone turned a switch or fress a  <br>00:33:06.039 button somewhere in a cyber security  <br>00:33:07.639 company I foret Cloud strike I think it  <br>00:33:09.799 was and and basically many many people  <br>00:33:13.360 shops couldn't use their terminals to  <br>00:33:15.120 take payments and you know all kinds of  <br>00:33:17.639 computer systems crashed what that  <br>00:33:19.519 showed to me and I hope it showed to the  <br>00:33:21.519 world is that data is now as more  <br>00:33:23.480 important as life as long as water  <br>00:33:26.200 because because we couldn't access data  <br>00:33:27.960 because we couldn't use it in our jobs  <br>00:33:29.720 all of a sudden the world stopped right  <br>00:33:31.919 because really what the computer was was  <br>00:33:33.240 just a device to create and show a state  <br>00:33:36.320 so when we start saying well data is an  <br>00:33:38.720 asset and you ask me blockchain and  <br>00:33:40.880 token the real value is when it becomes  <br>00:33:43.159 a real world asset because now everybody  <br>00:33:44.840 touches that data becomes a critical  <br>00:33:46.480 service  <br>00:33:48.440 provider they become regulated in terms  <br>00:33:50.799 of how they handle and manage data like  <br>00:33:52.360 the water company so I can't imagine the  <br>00:33:55.000 water company ever having a crisis like  <br>00:33:56.679 that and nobody ever been able to drink  <br>00:33:58.440 water in in a development bills it's the  <br>00:34:00.840 same thing he would just put extra  <br>00:34:02.399 layers of Regulation and the companies  <br>00:34:04.519 that store your data today would also be  <br>00:34:06.360 treated as a regulated entity so then  <br>00:34:08.599 all of a sudden then you've got a  <br>00:34:10.440 technology that allows you to move data  <br>00:34:12.199 around securely and safely and makes it  <br>00:34:14.079 traceable which is what we're talking  <br>00:34:15.440 about but also then the companies and  <br>00:34:17.480 the facilitator and look after for you  <br>00:34:19.399 are also treated as critical service  <br>00:34:21.119 providers so everything then changes  <br>00:34:23.839 because then you look at data then as  <br>00:34:25.399 not something that belongs in a system  <br>00:34:27.399 but it's it's actually critical to  <br>00:34:28.760 everything that we do you know for your  <br>00:34:30.560 listeners have a think about when you  <br>00:34:32.159 had breakfast this morning to when you  <br>00:34:33.440 went to bed how many things did you  <br>00:34:35.239 touch gave you data the screen you  <br>00:34:37.399 looked at the alarm clock in the morning  <br>00:34:38.960 that's digital all of those things are  <br>00:34:40.800 data really and they become so important  <br>00:34:43.119 to everyday life that we've lost sight  <br>00:34:45.239 of it which is why the technology allows  <br>00:34:47.679 us to make this possible but at the same  <br>00:34:49.800 time the regulation then allows us to  <br>00:34:51.320 change our  <br>00:34:53.800 mindset can I want to I want to get back  <br>00:34:56.040 to getting to some some kind of like mic  <br>00:34:58.200 drop moments here so we can we can get  <br>00:35:00.240 people that might have got a little bit  <br>00:35:02.119 confused by that excited again we talked  <br>00:35:03.880 about health yeah okay what a g give me  <br>00:35:06.200 some other give me some other fun  <br>00:35:07.720 examples of where where our audience  <br>00:35:10.160 right now will S I didn't know it could  <br>00:35:12.200 do that that would be cool for me if it  <br>00:35:14.119 could do this give me a couple of  <br>00:35:15.359 examples around that kind of stuff so  <br>00:35:17.400 let's go let s Finance okay um so  <br>00:35:20.280 there's a few things one I actually  <br>00:35:21.359 really want to do I'm kind of giving it  <br>00:35:22.760 do I give this away give it away I don't  <br>00:35:24.680 G to do anything with it I think you  <br>00:35:26.520 could build a data Bond what's a data  <br>00:35:28.560 Bond so in in financial terms you can  <br>00:35:30.359 you can invest in a bond yeah so this is  <br>00:35:32.440 basically where a government or an  <br>00:35:33.680 organization wants to wants to borrow  <br>00:35:35.240 money so say they're building a property  <br>00:35:37.920 um or even a group of properties they  <br>00:35:39.800 would issue a bond and they'll collect  <br>00:35:41.400 the money from people who will then get  <br>00:35:43.400 make money out of that property  <br>00:35:44.839 development over time the interest rate  <br>00:35:47.079 is usually fixed Y and they M them once  <br>00:35:49.280 that that Bond matures everybody gets  <br>00:35:50.839 their money out I think everyone  <br>00:35:52.920 understands that simply essentially is a  <br>00:35:54.640 loan okay someone's making a loan to  <br>00:35:56.599 somebody at a fixed rate of interest and  <br>00:35:58.240 the person that's making the loan isn't  <br>00:35:59.480 going to lend the money themselves  <br>00:36:00.480 they're going to let everybody else come  <br>00:36:01.520 in and be part of that lending that  <br>00:36:03.200 amount of money being lent so everyone  <br>00:36:04.920 can share in that return correct okay so  <br>00:36:07.040 it could be a Government Bond could be a  <br>00:36:08.319 corporate bond okay so what's a data  <br>00:36:10.560 Bond exactly the same thing so the  <br>00:36:12.760 government says do you know what we need  <br>00:36:14.400 some data to do something maybe the data  <br>00:36:16.640 is important to understand an area in  <br>00:36:19.000 Dubai that people may have that data or  <br>00:36:21.280 maybe they're trying to build something  <br>00:36:22.319 to do with house and they're trying to  <br>00:36:24.240 the impact of cocoa pops who knows  <br>00:36:28.200 or maybe it's a research company trying  <br>00:36:29.800 to build you know some medication m and  <br>00:36:32.319 they need they need the data of people  <br>00:36:33.800 they can't get today people may have a  <br>00:36:35.400 unique allergies or certain things  <br>00:36:37.200 because take covid right even though the  <br>00:36:39.119 the medication was heavily tested  <br>00:36:41.240 there's always going to be outliers  <br>00:36:42.920 because you just don't have enough  <br>00:36:44.359 testing data to prove but could you  <br>00:36:46.800 issue a bond to say actually instead of  <br>00:36:49.319 trying to take this data from people why  <br>00:36:51.400 don't you contribute and every time and  <br>00:36:53.839 then every as we're building this you  <br>00:36:55.240 will get rewarded every time your data  <br>00:36:56.599 is used this is why it's so cool in a  <br>00:36:59.560 bond I get paid once because it's only  <br>00:37:01.680 for the property but that same data  <br>00:37:03.200 could get used seven times or more or  <br>00:37:05.839 more which means I get rewarded every  <br>00:37:08.000 time and the government could even take  <br>00:37:09.839 a clip of that take some money off that  <br>00:37:11.839 as a as a as a revenue generator so the  <br>00:37:14.400 government's making money government's  <br>00:37:15.960 getting data they need and everybody  <br>00:37:17.480 else is getting rewarded at the same  <br>00:37:18.680 time how is that data for for the  <br>00:37:21.760 average Joe guy goes to work every day  <br>00:37:23.640 works at KPMG just become partner wife  <br>00:37:25.920 works as I don't know whatever another  <br>00:37:28.000 business she's an accountant let's say  <br>00:37:29.319 as well and they live a normal life they  <br>00:37:31.839 got two kids they live in Arabian  <br>00:37:33.200 ranches or wherever it may be they they  <br>00:37:34.839 a very normal life how does that that  <br>00:37:37.160 man that's sitting listening to this  <br>00:37:38.640 right now going holy macaroni this  <br>00:37:40.640 sounds cool how does he then consciously  <br>00:37:43.839 is he able to harvest and harness his  <br>00:37:46.400 own data so he will today is going be  <br>00:37:49.520 difficult right let's be H let's be  <br>00:37:50.520 honest there'll be certain data that he  <br>00:37:51.760 can't get if we use the examples of  <br>00:37:53.640 government with healths that's a lot  <br>00:37:55.720 desperate today there may be some things  <br>00:37:57.800 though that on your Apple watch and  <br>00:37:59.000 device you can be able to get yourself  <br>00:38:01.319 um could be your step count could be  <br>00:38:02.880 your heart rate or anything that makes  <br>00:38:04.200 you unique that could easily be given  <br>00:38:06.480 today um and all it would take is a is a  <br>00:38:09.240 bank to issue a bond I think in Dubai  <br>00:38:10.920 they've just done social bonds um  <br>00:38:13.119 there's no reason why you couldn't do  <br>00:38:14.119 one for data um so what it starts to do  <br>00:38:17.720 is starts and this is why I hope this  <br>00:38:19.680 happens with people listening they start  <br>00:38:22.040 looking at the data and questioning what  <br>00:38:23.640 that data means and is it valuable and  <br>00:38:26.000 more importantly is it valuable to them  <br>00:38:28.560 before but is it is it not a case of of  <br>00:38:30.880 some  <br>00:38:32.040 people will listen to this and go yeah  <br>00:38:34.280 this is really valuable but I don't even  <br>00:38:36.160 know where to start where where is where  <br>00:38:37.839 is my data you  <br>00:38:39.520 know and it may be this is the infancy  <br>00:38:42.160 and that's what you're bringing bringing  <br>00:38:43.319 to the world but but you know as we can  <br>00:38:47.800 clearly currently we can store our  <br>00:38:49.880 cryptocurrency on an exchange or we can  <br>00:38:51.680 store in a store in a cold wallet right  <br>00:38:54.160 um and so we've got those two options so  <br>00:38:56.920 for those people people that don't know  <br>00:38:57.880 what a cold storage is just think of a  <br>00:38:59.560 USB stick it's like it's the easiest way  <br>00:39:01.319 to describe it you put it on a USB stick  <br>00:39:02.960 and you put the USB in your pocket  <br>00:39:05.440 so for for those people wanting to be  <br>00:39:08.200 able to to harness it there will come a  <br>00:39:11.040 time in the not too dist future where  <br>00:39:12.800 they can literally every piece of data  <br>00:39:15.440 that they produce can be collected in an  <br>00:39:17.680 automated fashion and go into their  <br>00:39:20.520 storage facility of that and that's when  <br>00:39:23.480 they're going to have the power over it  <br>00:39:24.960 there'll be companies so there are  <br>00:39:26.800 companies that exist already so this is  <br>00:39:29.040 not like the fantasy of someone writing  <br>00:39:30.760 this the cool bit is I get the chance to  <br>00:39:32.200 work with people doing it yeah so  <br>00:39:33.760 there's a company I work with in silic  <br>00:39:35.359 and Valley who are building a data  <br>00:39:36.520 wallet where basically you'll be able to  <br>00:39:38.680 do exactly what I've just described they  <br>00:39:40.119 launch pretty soon where you'll be able  <br>00:39:41.960 to store your data and have a savings uh  <br>00:39:44.800 product capturing the rewards and value  <br>00:39:47.160 from your data um there are already  <br>00:39:49.400 companies on the internet where you can  <br>00:39:50.920 pull all your data together in a  <br>00:39:52.480 community mhm and every time that data  <br>00:39:54.680 is sold you get rewarded every time that  <br>00:39:56.880 data is used us so they could pull that  <br>00:39:58.720 data together and maybe sell it on like  <br>00:40:00.960 an app store or something like that a  <br>00:40:02.280 Marketplace that people would be  <br>00:40:03.280 familiar with they already exist by the  <br>00:40:05.599 by the way ex that like a Cooperative  <br>00:40:07.280 basically exactly exactly that so those  <br>00:40:09.680 exist today there's wallets that exist  <br>00:40:11.280 today there are companies in Saudi  <br>00:40:13.160 Arabia building what I'm describing for  <br>00:40:16.119 health um where people can actually  <br>00:40:17.920 manage their own health data and do that  <br>00:40:20.160 um there are already other companies in  <br>00:40:21.760 web 3 world which allow people to take  <br>00:40:23.680 their data that they store on the  <br>00:40:24.640 internet there's even browsers today  <br>00:40:25.920 like Brave and others that tell you and  <br>00:40:28.160 block advertising if you to look after  <br>00:40:30.319 your data so this is emerging and the  <br>00:40:32.560 biggest move that happened last year  <br>00:40:34.160 which listeners will not know is that  <br>00:40:36.440 Brazil is the first country in the world  <br>00:40:37.960 to allow its citizens to monetize their  <br>00:40:39.520 own data good old Brazil we love Brazil  <br>00:40:42.599 lived in Brazil for a few years there  <br>00:40:44.000 you go why the F Brazil um because they  <br>00:40:47.200 built the technology why if Brazil a  <br>00:40:49.839 developing country as big as it is  <br>00:40:52.040 Amazon covering a big chunk of it why it  <br>00:40:55.800 is crazy so over the last five years I'd  <br>00:40:59.359 say they've gone on a massive  <br>00:41:01.079 digitization Journey um I'm not sure if  <br>00:41:03.760 your listeners will be aware of the Pix  <br>00:41:04.920 network but it's a it's a competitive  <br>00:41:07.079 Network to the traditional payment  <br>00:41:08.680 companies but it's digital so the the  <br>00:41:11.280 fees are a lot cheaper but it makes it  <br>00:41:13.160 more accessible to everyone so they're  <br>00:41:15.079 almost using those digital rails now to  <br>00:41:17.240 eventually push tokens across them so  <br>00:41:19.400 now I've got a digital rail that means I  <br>00:41:20.760 can put any type of payment across it  <br>00:41:22.640 whether it be data whether it be Bitcoin  <br>00:41:24.160 it doesn't really matter um so now  <br>00:41:26.520 they've moved on to this level well  <br>00:41:28.160 actually isn't it time that our citizens  <br>00:41:30.359 got rewarded for how their data is being  <br>00:41:32.200 used um so that was literally written  <br>00:41:34.319 almost written into law last year this  <br>00:41:35.640 year so there's going for consultation  <br>00:41:37.839 and then once that becomes law again  <br>00:41:39.720 that could be a reference point for the  <br>00:41:41.000 rest of the world to say well hang on  <br>00:41:43.680 looks like things are changing and this  <br>00:41:45.160 is why you'll see these companies like  <br>00:41:46.880 even when I started writing my book  <br>00:41:48.720 there was no one it's taking me that  <br>00:41:50.960 long there's like now 30 40 people I  <br>00:41:53.359 meet all over the world I met people  <br>00:41:54.839 last week who are doing blockchain for  <br>00:41:56.920 health care in the United Kingdom MH  <br>00:41:58.920 they're working with patients and  <br>00:42:00.400 they're working with hospitals so they  <br>00:42:02.040 share data with patients and they also  <br>00:42:03.839 make money from that data so this is  <br>00:42:06.280 happening right now um and that's why  <br>00:42:08.760 this is exciting for me  <br>00:42:10.640 because it won't be the monetization  <br>00:42:12.880 that's the exciting bit is the things  <br>00:42:14.160 that we've talked about which is the  <br>00:42:15.520 prevention the ability to create your  <br>00:42:17.640 own mini programs to manage your health  <br>00:42:19.720 to manage your Finance you know talk  <br>00:42:21.680 about utilities that would excite your  <br>00:42:23.240 audience today not many people can  <br>00:42:25.760 understand Financial products mhm um  <br>00:42:28.000 because unfortunately that's a problem  <br>00:42:29.480 for the banking system because they just  <br>00:42:31.280 push their products to customers and  <br>00:42:32.640 hope they understand U not all banks do  <br>00:42:35.040 that but when you on your own data and  <br>00:42:37.359 you have an AI all of a sudden now that  <br>00:42:39.400 will then tailor what it tells you based  <br>00:42:41.079 on your level of understanding and  <br>00:42:42.720 learning so imagine hold on a minute  <br>00:42:44.720 let's just let's do that another way so  <br>00:42:46.760 everyone can get that because that's big  <br>00:42:48.520 yeah say that again so imagine today I  <br>00:42:51.960 have a mortgage and I'm given a leaflet  <br>00:42:54.599 that explains the mortgage to me uhuh  <br>00:42:56.680 everybody's understand that differently  <br>00:42:58.119 based on their literacy level yeah some  <br>00:43:00.000 people just won't get it yeah but what  <br>00:43:02.040 if your AI knew your educational history  <br>00:43:05.760 all your experience all your data and  <br>00:43:08.319 then suddenly interpreted that mortgage  <br>00:43:10.119 into a way that you  <br>00:43:14.839 understood that's the point in all this  <br>00:43:16.800 we have collected a lifetime worth of  <br>00:43:19.000 data and it tells everything about our  <br>00:43:21.440 past it tells us everything who we are  <br>00:43:24.200 but it also tells us who we could become  <br>00:43:26.880 and that's really the power when you  <br>00:43:28.040 start connecting all of this stuff  <br>00:43:30.119 because there is so much we've lost  <br>00:43:33.200 because it's been deleted but there's so  <br>00:43:35.079 much that we could gain because we can't  <br>00:43:36.839 get at it if we could get at it and  <br>00:43:39.440 connect it we could do so much more and  <br>00:43:42.280 what is making this conversation  <br>00:43:44.079 possible today is because the irony is  <br>00:43:46.599 all these technologies have come  <br>00:43:47.920 together at the same time and our  <br>00:43:49.880 maturity as a population of acceptance  <br>00:43:52.200 of technology is a lot higher than it  <br>00:43:53.760 was talk to me about the bit being  <br>00:43:56.599 deleted data being lost that will um I  <br>00:43:59.920 me I there was a guy in the office that  <br>00:44:01.440 came to me the other day and he said  <br>00:44:02.480 I've just got myself a new phone he said  <br>00:44:03.880 I've just lost 20 years of WhatsApp  <br>00:44:05.480 messages I'm like I'm not sure you had  <br>00:44:06.839 WhatsApp for 20 years but nonetheless  <br>00:44:08.520 said he said I said and he's got one  <br>00:44:10.480 Samsung phone to another I said well  <br>00:44:11.839 you've got your Samsung account you can  <br>00:44:13.200 find it no it's gone it's gone it's gone  <br>00:44:15.960 and I was like well you know what that  <br>00:44:17.160 might be a fresh  <br>00:44:18.760 start cuz if you got 20 years of  <br>00:44:20.880 messages on your phone then what kind of  <br>00:44:22.880 a life are you living but that aside he  <br>00:44:26.160 he then said to me but you don't realize  <br>00:44:28.000 he said there's all kinds of clients and  <br>00:44:30.720 leads and opportunities and Business  <br>00:44:32.760 Development chances that now I've lost  <br>00:44:34.880 and I won't be able to remember so  <br>00:44:37.400 that's that's that's that's a normal guy  <br>00:44:39.240 losing his data on his WhatsApp give me  <br>00:44:41.480 give me your explanation  <br>00:44:43.800 so he's correct obviously his timeline's  <br>00:44:46.440 not quite accurate um but he is correct  <br>00:44:49.960 so but the important thing that people  <br>00:44:51.520 need to realize is data is now a  <br>00:44:52.839 cultural artifact as well it's a record  <br>00:44:55.680 of who we were um 14 million people year  <br>00:44:58.400 ago to the pyramids of Egypt yeah right  <br>00:45:00.520 there's a reason for that because  <br>00:45:01.720 they're trying to understand the stories  <br>00:45:02.920 of the past that's where they go um data  <br>00:45:06.720 now has become a cultural artifact but  <br>00:45:08.480 we don't treat it as such so from 1991  <br>00:45:11.359 to 1995 the internet was never archived  <br>00:45:14.359 there's very little record of the  <br>00:45:15.880 internet from 1991 to 1995 okay 2009 and  <br>00:45:20.079 I we're showing our age right 2009 to  <br>00:45:22.160 2018 was the year of the geoc Cities the  <br>00:45:24.800 Myspace these big dominant um websites  <br>00:45:27.920 right where people used to write their  <br>00:45:29.079 music put their you know a lot of  <br>00:45:30.920 artists were discovered on my St B right  <br>00:45:33.599 um and you also got songs music stories  <br>00:45:36.200 everything blogs um all  <br>00:45:38.440 deleted on mypace Geo CI doesn't exist  <br>00:45:41.359 anymore it's been deleted Gio Ci's gone  <br>00:45:43.880 Myspace gone every piece of information  <br>00:45:47.599 that was on there downloaded uploaded  <br>00:45:49.280 Sorry by everybody je cities was wiped  <br>00:45:51.559 35 million users were gone so if you add  <br>00:45:55.359 up all of the websites that were deleted  <br>00:45:57.520 between 2009 and 2018 just to bring this  <br>00:46:00.559 to life for your audience that's the  <br>00:46:02.480 equivalent of me standing in front of  <br>00:46:03.839 the New York library and hitting delete  <br>00:46:05.119 and wiping it off the face of the earth  <br>00:46:07.480 that is half the Vatican archives being  <br>00:46:09.640 deleted that's what that means during  <br>00:46:12.480 covid the my understanding is that the  <br>00:46:15.480 British Museum and archives struggled to  <br>00:46:17.400 piece Co  <br>00:46:18.640 together because our data is constantly  <br>00:46:21.000 being deleted because it's not in our  <br>00:46:23.079 control um and also let's go back to  <br>00:46:26.240 WhatsApp as well  <br>00:46:27.839 let to make your audience think a little  <br>00:46:29.119 bit so I'm going to show My Age Again um  <br>00:46:31.720 again this demonstrates our lack of  <br>00:46:32.920 can't sit in my studio I know I'm you  <br>00:46:35.040 like you do shave like you're in a  <br>00:46:37.640 bloody boy bad talk to people about your  <br>00:46:39.720 age I know you're about 25 just want to  <br>00:46:42.359 shave um right so let's talk about this  <br>00:46:45.720 so if I talk about um if where we going  <br>00:46:49.040 with this so there's the cultural  <br>00:46:50.760 component yeah and then there's also was  <br>00:46:53.359 what was I saying WhatsApp WhatsApp yeah  <br>00:46:54.839 let's go back to WhatsApp so when we  <br>00:46:56.359 think of WhatsApp today let's go back to  <br>00:46:58.319 maybe I think it was the early 2000s  <br>00:47:00.280 Rupert Murdo tried to buy  <br>00:47:02.079 Sky he was told no he went through the  <br>00:47:05.119 competition Authority they said you  <br>00:47:06.400 can't do this because you will have the  <br>00:47:07.520 Monopoly on news Fair many years later  <br>00:47:11.880 Facebook buys WhatsApp and Instagram my  <br>00:47:14.400 argument is it's the same thing they now  <br>00:47:16.720 control the news and they control  <br>00:47:18.240 communication this is a a  <br>00:47:20.359 misunderstanding of not only the  <br>00:47:21.880 cultural example I give in terms of well  <br>00:47:24.040 we don't really understand the think of  <br>00:47:25.160 data as culture MH we also don't think  <br>00:47:27.440 of data and the companies that manage it  <br>00:47:29.319 as a form of communication and news so  <br>00:47:31.599 it's also a regulatory Gap when so the  <br>00:47:34.640 lot of the laws that exist today around  <br>00:47:36.559 merges and Acquisitions and competition  <br>00:47:38.680 they don't actually look at why these  <br>00:47:40.559 companies are buying these technology  <br>00:47:42.880 companies today they're not buying them  <br>00:47:44.680 for other than yes the technology but  <br>00:47:47.240 also the data that they can generate and  <br>00:47:48.920 they have so we are missing a lot of  <br>00:47:52.400 things that are on the surface not  <br>00:47:54.240 obvious so there's the data C culture  <br>00:47:56.680 there's there's the data merger and  <br>00:47:57.839 acquisition there's the data utilization  <br>00:48:00.440 we don't see all of these things have  <br>00:48:02.280 been going on for decades it's just the  <br>00:48:04.480 fact that AI has exposed them to us is  <br>00:48:06.920 there many people like you out there  <br>00:48:08.559 that are really excited about this  <br>00:48:10.400 subject matter that you spend time with  <br>00:48:12.559 talking to or is it or is it still very  <br>00:48:17.280 very early no it's so it's interesting  <br>00:48:20.119 it's almost like you bump into people  <br>00:48:22.280 like the universe wants you to meet them  <br>00:48:24.319 so I I I tend to bump into people at  <br>00:48:26.359 event saw through the network so I met  <br>00:48:30.040 the guy from the data wallet through a  <br>00:48:31.440 well-known person and you know he was  <br>00:48:33.599 like me to my brother right he was  <br>00:48:34.839 literally not only talking about a piece  <br>00:48:36.960 of what I'm talking about like he was  <br>00:48:38.200 building it and he could show me bits of  <br>00:48:40.160 it um and he was involved in the  <br>00:48:41.960 Brazilian regulation um and then i' met  <br>00:48:44.559 someone recently who's building all the  <br>00:48:45.960 health stuff so the cool thing is I'm  <br>00:48:48.760 meeting lots of people who are building  <br>00:48:51.520 in the book The Puzzle that I'm  <br>00:48:53.880 describing and we're describing is being  <br>00:48:55.640 built um that's exciting bit so now now  <br>00:48:59.240 my argument is always the same now we've  <br>00:49:00.720 got the tools we just need the will we  <br>00:49:02.680 need to change the way and that's part  <br>00:49:04.280 of you know what I'm doing and others  <br>00:49:06.040 like me are doing and part of the the  <br>00:49:07.760 work we're doing to help businesses and  <br>00:49:10.000 governments rethink this really  <br>00:49:12.520 important asset that's going to become  <br>00:49:14.680 crucial because there's also the people  <br>00:49:16.880 component in this that I think we' lost  <br>00:49:18.440 as well um which I think they will  <br>00:49:21.000 become even more important with AI Than  <br>00:49:22.599 People realize I think particularly with  <br>00:49:23.960 data interesting now your book is out  <br>00:49:27.119 when so this te is taking longer than I  <br>00:49:29.440 thought and that's cuz the world doesn't  <br>00:49:31.359 stop so 2025 so early 2025 is the plan  <br>00:49:35.079 and the name of the book uh data  <br>00:49:36.520 Revolution the rise of an asset data  <br>00:49:38.920 Revolution the rise of an asset will you  <br>00:49:40.480 do it for us in audio form as well for  <br>00:49:42.480 people that 100% um So the plan is to do  <br>00:49:45.000 two things actually so the first part of  <br>00:49:46.440 the book is a voice for a generation to  <br>00:49:48.799 demand change is to show them what data  <br>00:49:51.599 is and what it became and how it changed  <br>00:49:53.440 and what we Mis outed on but also what  <br>00:49:55.240 could be um this is not sad story um and  <br>00:49:58.359 then we show them the model to make this  <br>00:50:00.119 work so you've asked all the right  <br>00:50:02.079 questions today um and that's why I  <br>00:50:04.200 didn't want to leave people hanging and  <br>00:50:05.799 go well okay this is a great book about  <br>00:50:07.240 history what does this mean because I  <br>00:50:08.440 think the talking is over we need  <br>00:50:09.760 direction now so the second part of the  <br>00:50:11.760 book is the guide book on how to do it  <br>00:50:13.680 so the regulation the model that makes  <br>00:50:15.440 it work all the things that you've asked  <br>00:50:17.000 me about today will be in there even new  <br>00:50:19.079 curriculums for school even the way the  <br>00:50:21.079 businesses need to think about hiring  <br>00:50:22.440 people and all the skills that they're  <br>00:50:23.680 going to be needing to make all of this  <br>00:50:25.359 work if you if you if you've got kids at  <br>00:50:27.799 school and they're seven or eight years  <br>00:50:30.160 old this this is essentially essentially  <br>00:50:33.720 this is essential as a subject matter  <br>00:50:35.760 for them to learn oh 100% because I I  <br>00:50:38.160 think it's a combination of data and AI  <br>00:50:40.559 so we're seeing a lot of conversation  <br>00:50:43.160 around curriculums for AI and teaching  <br>00:50:45.359 kids I'm seeing nothing about data and I  <br>00:50:47.880 think the two go hand inand um I will  <br>00:50:50.799 guarantee something in in three four  <br>00:50:52.319 years time the skills and experiences  <br>00:50:54.720 that people bring to a business or  <br>00:50:56.160 people have in their own life will  <br>00:50:58.040 become incredibly valuable to businesses  <br>00:50:59.760 to the point where and I'll show in the  <br>00:51:01.160 book how you can start valuing people's  <br>00:51:03.119 skills because it's those skills are  <br>00:51:05.319 going to be important to read what AI  <br>00:51:07.599 says but also give the data that AI  <br>00:51:10.040 needs because they're going to come from  <br>00:51:11.680 people right absolutely okay three tips  <br>00:51:14.960 you can give the man on the street  <br>00:51:17.319 related to his data that he can sit and  <br>00:51:20.720 and be highly aware of now and get him  <br>00:51:23.280 into a really conscious state so I think  <br>00:51:25.440 the first thing is have a think about  <br>00:51:28.160 how much data you use every day and what  <br>00:51:30.200 do you use it for and second is who are  <br>00:51:32.599 you giving that data away to and are  <br>00:51:35.240 there ways that you can maybe stop that  <br>00:51:37.280 because there are tools on apps that  <br>00:51:38.400 allow you to do it um and there's also  <br>00:51:40.480 other technologies that you can find on  <br>00:51:41.920 the web that may help you get the most  <br>00:51:43.119 from it I think the third thing is the  <br>00:51:45.400 most important is start thinking about  <br>00:51:47.720 how you can use that data in your own  <br>00:51:49.160 life to make it better um like I work  <br>00:51:52.119 with my PT constantly and we're using  <br>00:51:53.880 data to improve my performance or even  <br>00:51:56.599 just simple things like I use data to  <br>00:51:57.960 cure my own health um so start looking  <br>00:52:01.480 at these things as tools so you know be  <br>00:52:04.200 careful who you give it to understand  <br>00:52:05.520 what you're giving but more importantly  <br>00:52:07.119 start to build an understanding how you  <br>00:52:08.559 can use it for yourself in ways other  <br>00:52:10.640 than just making money and I guess  <br>00:52:12.240 there's a fourth one which is look  <br>00:52:13.960 beyond the technology and don't be  <br>00:52:15.359 afraid about AI because actually once  <br>00:52:17.640 you start understanding your data and  <br>00:52:19.119 you can actually understand how to read  <br>00:52:20.359 it AI starts to become really useful  <br>00:52:22.359 then because it's not really about then  <br>00:52:24.040 as taking their jobs it's about working  <br>00:52:25.880 with AI  <br>00:52:27.160 to understand these predictive things  <br>00:52:28.880 that we've been talking about incredibly  <br>00:52:31.040 value Michael God thank you enough for  <br>00:52:33.160 coming and sharing this wisdom with us  <br>00:52:34.680 today it's been fantastic talking to you  <br>00:52:36.319 thank you so much for joining us no  <br>00:52:37.640 thanks for having me it's been amazing|## SUMMARY  <br>Futurist

much  <br>00:02:06.640 for coming on the show I wanted to do  <br>00:02:08.360 this interview for ages so I really  <br>00:02:09.919 appreciate your time today delighted to  <br>00:02:11.560 be here ready to go I've got to know you  <br>00:02:14.000 over the course of the last few months  <br>00:02:15.879 and been fascinated by your story what  <br>00:02:18.920 you do as a businessman how you

with how you think okay and how  <br>00:02:31.680 you operate as a human being is  <br>00:02:33.040 something that I've really wanted to try  <br>00:02:34.319 and get to the bottom of and learn about  <br>00:02:36.480 for my own benefit but also with  <br>00:02:38.560 everybody that consumes this content and  <br>00:02:40.239 this podcast I want really people to  <br>00:02:41.840 take some real valuable lessons for this  <br>00:02:43.519 today so first of all let's just start  <br>00:02:46.080 off with a bit of a background on on  <br>00:02:47.519 your business okay and your business  <br>00:02:49.599 career so we can give people some  <br>00:02:50.879 context and then we're going to dive  <br>00:02:52.000 into a few other areas and then  <br>00:02:53.280 hopefully we'll just patch it all up  <br>00:02:54.680 together and people will see why you are  <br>00:02:57.040 who you are and why you do what you do  <br>00:02:59.360 okay well I started I studied uh primary  <br>00:03:02.640 Business Degree with French business  <br>00:03:04.440 process or engineering so I was always  <br>00:03:05.959 kind of process-led but not technology  <br>00:03:08.400 was all strategy uh you couldn't do that  <br>00:03:11.440 uh without embracing technology and very  <br>00:03:14.400 very early on like 1995 96 I got  <br>00:03:17.560 introduced to the internet and I was  <br>00:03:19.560 actually working in IBM at the time in  <br>00:03:21.120 Dublin and I was basically still a  <br>00:03:23.400 student and I remember just thinking wow  <br>00:03:25.120 this is this has got reached this has  <br>00:03:27.159 got benefit so I kind of decided to take  <br>00:03:30.040 my career on on on that as a medium and  <br>00:03:32.840 so I started by understanding the  <br>00:03:35.159 mathematics behind building networks  <br>00:03:36.879 tcpip and so on which my brain really  <br>00:03:39.239 only started working in college so then  <br>00:03:41.080 things made sense to me in terms of how  <br>00:03:42.519 you map things out and uh then I started  <br>00:03:45.159 lecturing on that started talking about  <br>00:03:46.560 it and teaching people and bringing  <br>00:03:48.159 people along and started getting  <br>00:03:50.400 insights into how people receive  <br>00:03:52.720 information because you know you're  <br>00:03:54.239 there lecturing on these pretty tough  <br>00:03:56.319 topics but you're saying the same thing  <br>00:03:58.599 week after week uh but you see them  <br>00:04:00.640 taking it in for the first time or not  <br>00:04:02.239 taking it in and it it teaches you a lot  <br>00:04:04.480 about how people absorb information how  <br>00:04:07.200 they bounces off them sometimes and  <br>00:04:08.720 things like that because to you it's  <br>00:04:10.480 autopilot so you can focus on them  <br>00:04:12.640 rather than what's coming out of your  <br>00:04:14.239 mouth you know it inside out and uh so  <br>00:04:16.160 that was really interesting and that  <br>00:04:17.720 kind of led me to to a lot of  <br>00:04:19.639 realizations  <br>00:04:21.040 about tech and people because you got  <br>00:04:23.759 people who they wanted to look good in  <br>00:04:25.360 their jobs they were good at marketing  <br>00:04:26.960 or something else and then suddenly  <br>00:04:28.400 there's this internet thing that they  <br>00:04:29.720 they have to understand I wasn't a  <br>00:04:32.199 techie I couldn't go deep on this stuff  <br>00:04:34.000 I I but I started working with people  <br>00:04:35.960 who could and I kind of made a career  <br>00:04:37.960 for myself out of being in that bridge  <br>00:04:40.160 between the human problem and and  <br>00:04:43.360 technology so then I got into uh  <br>00:04:46.880 internet development companies from  <br>00:04:48.520 there and then in 2002 I started my  <br>00:04:51.360 first startup I actually moved home to  <br>00:04:53.440 my parents uh house went up to the attic  <br>00:04:56.360 rolled out a carpet and made a deal with  <br>00:04:58.120 them and said look I I'm using my  <br>00:04:59.680 apartment savings to pay for other staff  <br>00:05:02.080 but um if I can work here I'll just make  <br>00:05:05.039 sure there's always good wine in the  <br>00:05:06.160 fridge and we shook hands on that and  <br>00:05:07.680 that was it I started there then I moved  <br>00:05:10.360 to my first office because I could I  <br>00:05:12.880 could pay a monthly rent first so I  <br>00:05:14.479 didn't have to commit to a long-term  <br>00:05:15.919 lease and that was above a shop and that  <br>00:05:18.160 was disastrous because the boardroom we  <br>00:05:20.880 had I I had bought a a table in a  <br>00:05:24.080 liquidation sale from an old friend of  <br>00:05:25.800 mine which was huge and in our front  <br>00:05:29.120 room which was a converted bedroom or  <br>00:05:30.800 boardroom as we call it if there's more  <br>00:05:32.639 than five people in the room the floor  <br>00:05:34.199 started to give so if a client arrived  <br>00:05:36.520 with more than two people with I might  <br>00:05:37.919 have to say to one of my staff go out  <br>00:05:39.400 the back door I'll tell them you're sick  <br>00:05:40.680 because we couldn't admit that the floor  <br>00:05:41.919 was caving in and we only had one you  <br>00:05:44.960 there was about a 12we lead time for an  <br>00:05:46.880 internet cable for ISDN it's 128  <br>00:05:50.039 kilobyte so we had one phone cable there  <br>00:05:52.800 was six staff one phone cable and uh the  <br>00:05:55.560 debate every day was who's got the  <br>00:05:57.039 internet so we were a web agency  <br>00:05:59.080 pitching for these these large  <br>00:06:00.800 contracts and uh we'd have debates every  <br>00:06:03.080 day why do you need the internet today  <br>00:06:04.479 and you like why you get this proposal  <br>00:06:06.160 at your client why do you need it and  <br>00:06:07.840 the tech you like if I don't start  <br>00:06:08.960 uploading the website today it won't be  <br>00:06:10.880 there by 8:00 in the morning okay you  <br>00:06:13.319 win so that was a Continuum that was my  <br>00:06:15.880 first startup and uh I'd call it  <br>00:06:18.199 Continuum because I wanted an ongoing  <br>00:06:20.080 relationship with with uh customers it  <br>00:06:22.919 started as being Continuum Technologies  <br>00:06:24.520 but the Technologies word aged really  <br>00:06:26.960 really quickly so I very quickly pivoted  <br>00:06:29.240 to kind of make it about people and uh  <br>00:06:31.599 we did very well we grew up and then and  <br>00:06:33.639 then in 2015 I overleveraged myself and  <br>00:06:36.560 then broke that out into a group so we  <br>00:06:38.680 had uh a lot more opportunities for  <br>00:06:41.080 growth there because people were coming  <br>00:06:42.800 to agencies saying I need a thing built  <br>00:06:44.720 I've got this budget this time scale and  <br>00:06:46.720 it has to do the following and I really  <br>00:06:48.960 want to get ahead of that say well how  <br>00:06:51.360 did you make all those decisions how do  <br>00:06:52.599 you know they're the right decisions and  <br>00:06:54.199 they typically didn't have answers so  <br>00:06:56.360 then we went towards what was called  <br>00:06:58.000 digital transformation which was getting  <br>00:06:59.759 ahead of that and you'd go in and write  <br>00:07:02.000 the road map with them and keep more  <br>00:07:04.039 importantly get the benefit of the doubt  <br>00:07:05.639 from them that you know let's talk about  <br>00:07:08.240 the proposal before you decide selling  <br>00:07:10.479 this to North America is the plan you  <br>00:07:13.120 challenge that idea but what it also  <br>00:07:15.680 meant then is that suddenly you were  <br>00:07:17.039 influential on how they went to B  <br>00:07:19.280 business and then suddenly you were  <br>00:07:20.319 winning business by default so we could  <br>00:07:22.199 start much earlier than a lot of our  <br>00:07:23.680 competition and then we could end much  <br>00:07:25.680 further because then we went into cyber  <br>00:07:28.120 security we went into hosting we went  <br>00:07:29.840 into  <br>00:07:30.720 24/7 uh support so you couldn't have  <br>00:07:34.199 full-time Engineers all the time but we  <br>00:07:35.879 had Partnerships with places that had  <br>00:07:38.160 24-hour Network operating centers and  <br>00:07:40.120 you just hand them a run book after 5:30  <br>00:07:42.720 at night so you were able to then  <br>00:07:45.520 support your clients 247 for a lot  <br>00:07:47.319 cheaper than a lot of your competition  <br>00:07:49.319 and there was still an escalation  <br>00:07:50.919 process um but when we started I mean I  <br>00:07:53.639 had a one-page website that was an extr  <br>00:07:56.840 net it said please enter your your  <br>00:07:58.400 username and password to log in cuz it  <br>00:08:01.199 was completely bootstrapped right and no  <br>00:08:03.440 matter what you put in there it just  <br>00:08:04.680 came back with oh I'm sorry your  <br>00:08:06.120 username is incorrect please contact  <br>00:08:07.879 sales at this number for extra support  <br>00:08:10.319 which rang my mobile directly and I  <br>00:08:12.680 remember when I won my first big  <br>00:08:14.039 contract uh it was actually Nissan and  <br>00:08:16.720 uh I remember the guys asked me do we  <br>00:08:18.120 get access to your Swanky externet now I  <br>00:08:20.280 said no no no you get me fulltime you  <br>00:08:21.960 get all of our service so it you know it  <br>00:08:24.680 was it was a bit of a bit of that it was  <br>00:08:26.800 very very critical path um very much  <br>00:08:29.039 about um being very deliberate there's a  <br>00:08:31.520 word I overuse which is the word  <br>00:08:32.958 deliberate but it was it was about being  <br>00:08:34.719 very very specific and very deliberate  <br>00:08:36.360 both in terms of what you were doing  <br>00:08:38.360 more importantly what you weren't doing  <br>00:08:40.440 and uh you know the people that you went  <br>00:08:42.479 along with you know it's a it's a space  <br>00:08:44.720 where you have to admit very quickly I  <br>00:08:46.519 just don't understand that or I I know  <br>00:08:48.680 what to get out of that person or that  <br>00:08:50.320 Tech or that skill and and how to pull  <br>00:08:52.600 it together and as that evolved into a  <br>00:08:54.399 group and we started getting much bigger  <br>00:08:55.880 clients and much longer contracts and a  <br>00:08:57.920 lot more dependencies  <br>00:08:59.880 you know I remember being challenged One  <br>00:09:01.320 Day by a very large International firm  <br>00:09:03.000 the head of marketing and she said  <br>00:09:04.360 you're the guy I never meet again once I  <br>00:09:06.720 sign this contract and I said I'm the  <br>00:09:09.480 guy that's responsible to make sure you  <br>00:09:11.320 have the right people in front of you at  <br>00:09:12.560 the right time and if that doesn't  <br>00:09:14.360 happen then I'm the guy you call and she  <br>00:09:16.440 said fair enough and she signed a  <br>00:09:17.480 multiion contract on that and and that  <br>00:09:20.040 was kind of that was the approach um but  <br>00:09:22.480 it was you know hard yards I went  <br>00:09:24.600 through two recessions a pandemic uh and  <br>00:09:28.680 I built up into a group I sold U most  <br>00:09:31.680 Parts anything that had staff um I sold  <br>00:09:35.079 I was taking a break I had lost  <br>00:09:36.440 unfortunately one or two members of my  <br>00:09:37.680 family and just decided to take a break  <br>00:09:39.560 so sold all of that and kept the  <br>00:09:41.560 investment stuff which brings us up to  <br>00:09:45.200 2018 uh where I live now is continuous  <br>00:09:47.760 Ventures uh and how I'd started that was  <br>00:09:51.800 as a give back as a CS so we did lots of  <br>00:09:54.240 Charity websites and projects and I went  <br>00:09:56.160 to Africa for years I went to Chernobyl  <br>00:09:57.920 I went to all these places because I had  <br>00:09:59.839 that freedom you know the tech was going  <br>00:10:01.519 well the business was going well I was  <br>00:10:03.000 free and single I was just enjoying  <br>00:10:05.240 other things in life I played music I  <br>00:10:07.040 wrote all these things uh and it was  <br>00:10:09.440 nice it was very very fulfilling uh as  <br>00:10:11.760 part of that and you know to be honest  <br>00:10:13.839 I'd become a bit complacent about  <br>00:10:15.120 business it kind of ran itself and I was  <br>00:10:16.839 like okay well I can now do this in my  <br>00:10:18.959 sleep and now just es and flows with  <br>00:10:21.240 society and values and markets and so on  <br>00:10:24.240 so it's doing other things but one thing  <br>00:10:25.920 that I really got struck by was the  <br>00:10:28.320 amount of mistakes that's startups we're  <br>00:10:30.279 making and uh as our give back instead  <br>00:10:33.600 of doing all the charity stuff which is  <br>00:10:35.079 extremely important but I found that the  <br>00:10:37.519 ask never changed it was just we need  <br>00:10:39.320 more of the same we need more of the  <br>00:10:40.560 same More Money More investment we'd  <br>00:10:42.320 build websites extr Nets things like  <br>00:10:44.959 that for them just as a as a giveaway  <br>00:10:46.639 just best of luck with that and and you  <br>00:10:48.639 know it was very important work  <br>00:10:51.480 extremely important but it was a lot of  <br>00:10:53.079 the same and the biggest lesson it  <br>00:10:55.760 taught me was about you know I mean you  <br>00:10:58.360 focus on the power content for for your  <br>00:11:00.880 for your living for what we're doing  <br>00:11:02.320 right here but in agency world you kind  <br>00:11:04.839 of it's about the impact of the message  <br>00:11:06.639 for the customer or the customer's  <br>00:11:08.200 customer and so on but I remember we  <br>00:11:09.800 were doing a website for a kids  <br>00:11:11.240 orphanage and a a Content update update  <br>00:11:14.560 came up to the design team and they just  <br>00:11:17.200 said uh can you remove the pictures of  <br>00:11:18.959 those three girls because they've all  <br>00:11:20.120 passed away and they were all like 10 12  <br>00:11:22.079 years of age and the impact in the  <br>00:11:24.480 office I can still get the Goosebumps  <br>00:11:26.240 now it hit the place like a tsunami it  <br>00:11:28.639 was just this  <br>00:11:30.440 Frozen vacuum of feeling that they the  <br>00:11:34.079 impact of that for designers and  <br>00:11:35.880 developers there was tears there was  <br>00:11:37.279 everything and you get that a lot with  <br>00:11:40.000 you know charity projects some of your  <br>00:11:41.959 most calm and quiet staff could be ones  <br>00:11:45.279 that feel the most passionate about a  <br>00:11:47.720 particular cause or particular um you  <br>00:11:50.120 know charity or or proposal um but I  <br>00:11:53.839 just remember the uniformity of of of  <br>00:11:56.200 everyone's feelings and that I was just  <br>00:11:57.519 sudden like oh God this is this is  <br>00:11:58.959 really real it's not just web stuff so I  <br>00:12:02.240 decided after that it was one of those  <br>00:12:04.320 kind of moments I just thought I need  <br>00:12:06.440 this needs to be about real people how  <br>00:12:08.040 we help Society sh about real real  <br>00:12:10.279 people so what it did was every second  <br>00:12:12.600 Thursday because we built out a group  <br>00:12:14.120 with a lot of senior people um every  <br>00:12:16.639 second Thursday I would advise for free  <br>00:12:19.079 with startups and just put it out there  <br>00:12:21.160 you i' kind of grown up in business in  <br>00:12:22.760 Dublin was well known in business terms  <br>00:12:25.199 particularly in Internet terms in Dublin  <br>00:12:27.360 and so just put Linked In and things  <br>00:12:29.920 like that you know with a little bit of  <br>00:12:31.800 pre-qualification we'll look at some of  <br>00:12:33.519 these things and then again because I  <br>00:12:35.959 wouldn't understand it fully I'd pull in  <br>00:12:37.800 you know CTO or design or development or  <br>00:12:40.920 strategy and then this kind of formula  <br>00:12:43.399 was born  <br>00:12:45.000 where I could make these very senior  <br>00:12:47.240 people that were sunken cost to us I  <br>00:12:49.480 could make them available to these  <br>00:12:50.760 startups just to help them avoid the  <br>00:12:52.519 mistakes that I made you know they say  <br>00:12:54.440 an expert is somebody who's made every  <br>00:12:56.000 mistake in a focused area uh I was  <br>00:12:58.880 definitely an expert for making all  <br>00:13:01.000 those mistakes and it was great  <br>00:13:02.680 satisfaction in just helping them  <br>00:13:04.639 reverse out of situations that they'  <br>00:13:06.639 caught up you know every every company  <br>00:13:08.639 has challenges that to them is  <br>00:13:11.000 completely new but you start seeing it  <br>00:13:12.519 on a routine basis you're like oh i'  <br>00:13:14.399 just I'd caution you there or let's just  <br>00:13:16.920 have another look at that and you try  <br>00:13:18.279 and draw it out of them rather than tell  <br>00:13:19.959 them you know um the language you use is  <br>00:13:22.720 very important but I was used to dealing  <br>00:13:24.160 with super bright people far brighter  <br>00:13:26.079 than me I like being the dumbest guy in  <br>00:13:27.839 every room particularly the team I've  <br>00:13:29.440 recently uh built and uh so the language  <br>00:13:33.120 you use is kind of supportive but coxing  <br>00:13:35.079 you know you firm on topics not on  <br>00:13:36.720 people and things like that and uh and  <br>00:13:39.519 then you know when when you needed to be  <br>00:13:40.959 a bit stronger with them you could be  <br>00:13:42.480 and then that led to being chairman of  <br>00:13:44.240 one or two things and I personally  <br>00:13:45.639 invested in a few of these startups but  <br>00:13:48.519 the energy that came from these as I saw  <br>00:13:51.519 them kids I mean they weren't but they  <br>00:13:53.720 were kids and and uh excited  <br>00:13:57.079 entrepreneurs and first timers and and  <br>00:13:59.120 midtimes and all this kind of stuff it  <br>00:14:01.680 just reinvigorated me towards the  <br>00:14:03.519 strategy of business and the ABS and  <br>00:14:05.120 flows and you know my kind of best  <br>00:14:08.040 definition of an entrepreneur is is is  <br>00:14:10.199 somebody who creates unlimited results  <br>00:14:13.199 out of often limited to no means by use  <br>00:14:16.199 of their their focus their ability to  <br>00:14:18.399 harness Talent harness people and  <br>00:14:19.920 resources and opportunities around them  <br>00:14:21.639 to to see their purpose through and you  <br>00:14:24.519 just trying to put that into these guys  <br>00:14:26.399 or you know or Draw it out of them some  <br>00:14:27.959 of them are amazing but they can't talk  <br>00:14:30.560 to somebody they can they can explain  <br>00:14:32.680 the best mathematics in the world but  <br>00:14:34.320 you put them in a room with a pretty  <br>00:14:35.920 girl and they go red and stare at the  <br>00:14:38.040 floor you know everyone needed strength  <br>00:14:40.360 at different times but certainly the  <br>00:14:43.199 model for continuous Ventures was born  <br>00:14:45.240 out of that fact that apart from the  <br>00:14:47.040 advisory and the investment making very  <br>00:14:50.199 Senior People available to these  <br>00:14:51.680 startups so they're not burning their  <br>00:14:53.199 own cash all the time you see these  <br>00:14:54.720 startups they raise a million or two and  <br>00:14:57.360 then before you know they've hired  <br>00:14:58.440 people they don't how to use properly  <br>00:15:00.040 they're underutilized even from a time  <br>00:15:01.839 and cost point of view and they're  <br>00:15:03.600 burning cash and suddenly the pressure's  <br>00:15:05.279 on and they probably got a a bear of an  <br>00:15:07.600 investor sitting at the boardroom table  <br>00:15:09.199 tapping the  <br>00:15:10.519 table so we could just absorb that into  <br>00:15:13.000 our model and and then kind of  <br>00:15:14.680 facilitate the conduit for startups and  <br>00:15:17.199 that's what I do know  <br>00:15:19.959 wow let's talk about digital  <br>00:15:22.000 transformation because I think it's a  <br>00:15:24.399 term that's that's widely used that most  <br>00:15:27.480 people don't really understand so can  <br>00:15:29.120 you explain to me what it is and give me  <br>00:15:30.920 an  <br>00:15:31.600 example yes uh one of the things about  <br>00:15:34.000 digital transformation is defining what  <br>00:15:35.720 it isn't uh every company will say we  <br>00:15:38.199 want to be you know we want to do a  <br>00:15:40.360 digital transformation program and we're  <br>00:15:42.160 going to be the best in our field or  <br>00:15:43.519 we're going to be you know leading the  <br>00:15:45.480 market and so  <br>00:15:46.639 on companies want digital transformation  <br>00:15:49.199 until you try and change something and  <br>00:15:50.759 then they realize they just want digital  <br>00:15:52.360 efficiency they want it faster a little  <br>00:15:54.560 bit more accurate or better or shinier  <br>00:15:57.519 but when you say okay we're going to  <br>00:15:59.480 totally recalibrate how you do your  <br>00:16:01.079 business how you talk to your customer  <br>00:16:02.480 where you where your customer is or what  <br>00:16:03.920 channels you go to market or a big one  <br>00:16:06.959 is what do you do with your data do you  <br>00:16:09.360 you gather loads of data have you any  <br>00:16:11.079 insight on what that data  <br>00:16:12.959 is and then you try and you you try and  <br>00:16:15.560 recalibrate you try and change it find  <br>00:16:17.440 new rootes to Market an example I gave  <br>00:16:19.560 was you get the airline business they  <br>00:16:21.680 know you're flying from from Dublin to  <br>00:16:23.720 Dubai and you're flying you know at on  <br>00:16:26.240 this date you've booked it in a certain  <br>00:16:27.959 language you're your you know business  <br>00:16:30.319 or first or economy class you know what  <br>00:16:33.160 airport you're going to how long you're  <br>00:16:34.680 staying all of that  <br>00:16:36.199 data and the airline business started  <br>00:16:38.399 kind of transforming that to say okay  <br>00:16:40.120 well then we can start making  <br>00:16:41.319 assumptions and now it's done with more  <br>00:16:42.880 AI but it was more kind of digital  <br>00:16:45.319 suppositions before to say okay well  <br>00:16:47.800 you're traveling with two kids so you  <br>00:16:49.639 possibly need a car and you possibly  <br>00:16:51.440 need to return it on this day so here's  <br>00:16:52.920 a guest average of a three star level  <br>00:16:55.720 car at this price or three star level  <br>00:16:58.639 hot hotel or five star level Hotel  <br>00:17:00.680 depending on your profile and you know I  <br>00:17:03.920 I remember working on that a long long  <br>00:17:05.559 time ago for Rhino [hotels.com](http://hotels.com/) for  <br>00:17:07.799 example and they they in the first year  <br>00:17:10.000 they increased the revenue by 11% just  <br>00:17:12.079 by changing that one thing and that's a  <br>00:17:14.799 you know it's using your data to reach  <br>00:17:17.199 your customer in a in a deeper way not  <br>00:17:19.280 in a new way because you've already sold  <br>00:17:21.000 to them but now you're saying let's  <br>00:17:22.119 let's solve those problems for you as  <br>00:17:23.520 well and in this in the spirit of  <br>00:17:26.000 critical thinking and deliberate  <br>00:17:27.679 thinking it's it's how do you nail the  <br>00:17:30.679 job to be done you know and old elector  <br>00:17:32.760 mind you say that how do you nail the  <br>00:17:34.160 job to be done getting that one thing  <br>00:17:37.039 right that is a pain for a customer and  <br>00:17:39.679 you solve it and it's that thing of you  <br>00:17:41.600 don't buy a drill because you need a  <br>00:17:42.799 drill you buy a drill because you need a  <br>00:17:44.160 hole so so can can I maybe take an  <br>00:17:47.360 example within my business about how  <br>00:17:49.840 that would apply then so so one of my  <br>00:17:51.760 businesses is an insurance brokerage  <br>00:17:54.039 that insurance brokerage predominantly  <br>00:17:55.799 sells medical insurance okay now our  <br>00:17:58.559 client have other insurance needs but we  <br>00:18:01.039 predominantly focus on medical insurance  <br>00:18:03.799 but the buyer or the decision maker  <br>00:18:07.400 would be the HR Director followed by the  <br>00:18:11.080 CFO who would sign it off so HR Director  <br>00:18:13.080 does the leg work CFO signs it off make  <br>00:18:14.960 sure they've got the budget to do  <br>00:18:16.559 it we have a requirement to potentially  <br>00:18:19.919 Sell gratuiti Solutions to companies  <br>00:18:22.320 here the same decision maker is involved  <br>00:18:25.159 on a B2B basis really because the HR  <br>00:18:27.240 Director and the CFO are the ones that  <br>00:18:28.520 were the decisions about that kind of  <br>00:18:30.120 stuff so am why on the clock now am I am  <br>00:18:32.280 I  <br>00:18:34.360 good I just because I want I want to  <br>00:18:36.400 give everyone context if we could we we  <br>00:18:38.200 we could do it there because I think  <br>00:18:39.200 that was a b Toc model and and and  <br>00:18:41.440 because digital transformation I think  <br>00:18:42.799 would apply to B2B of course as well  <br>00:18:44.440 yeah yeah it's where most of the most of  <br>00:18:46.120 the work is so the work that you'd be  <br>00:18:47.960 doing is you potentially would be  <br>00:18:49.679 looking at that saying right you're  <br>00:18:50.720 sending to this type of customer this  <br>00:18:53.039 type of product or service what other  <br>00:18:54.880 the problems do they have and how can I  <br>00:18:57.600 solve other problems that they've got  <br>00:18:59.679 because they've already made a  <br>00:19:00.640 commitment to be a customer anyway and  <br>00:19:02.679 how can I do that in a more digitally  <br>00:19:05.039 effective process yeah in fact the the  <br>00:19:08.200 example you give is is a very  <br>00:19:09.919 interesting and easier one to solve  <br>00:19:12.080 although it's it's big pieces of work  <br>00:19:14.440 and the first thing you do is you know  <br>00:19:15.880 you say for example a HR Director um  <br>00:19:18.600 would be would be involved in in signing  <br>00:19:20.480 off on that for a company so  <br>00:19:22.760 particularly in Dubai you've got a legal  <br>00:19:24.200 requirement to provide certain levels of  <br>00:19:25.640 health insurance and so on and then  <br>00:19:26.919 depending on the profile of the staff  <br>00:19:28.400 you might at various  <br>00:19:30.000 levels so you got that but then you look  <br>00:19:32.960 at the problems that the HR Director or  <br>00:19:36.679 chief people officer has so actually up  <br>00:19:39.080 until recently and a client to  <br>00:19:40.280 continuous is a company called covis and  <br>00:19:42.480 they're like the Harvard Business review  <br>00:19:43.960 of strategy for chief people officers  <br>00:19:46.280 right so when the you know the chief  <br>00:19:48.320 people officer of Pepsi gets asked  <br>00:19:50.120 what's our working from home policy post  <br>00:19:52.080 pandemic they turn to academics to say  <br>00:19:55.120 well you know firstly prove it secondly  <br>00:19:57.720 give me a template for in that out  <br>00:19:59.320 across my staff across the world so if  <br>00:20:01.840 you look at that person's um profile and  <br>00:20:05.039 problem it's typically a mid toate uh  <br>00:20:08.039 director female and in in that role but  <br>00:20:12.280 then if you think of let's say her  <br>00:20:15.280 her uh customers and her customers are  <br>00:20:18.039 the staff so then you take anything that  <br>00:20:20.559 you're signing and passing through like  <br>00:20:22.240 Insurance whether it's medical insurance  <br>00:20:24.559 whether it's car insurance pet insurance  <br>00:20:26.159 doesn't matter that's solving a problem  <br>00:20:28.080 for her C customer who is the the staff  <br>00:20:30.240 member so then you follow the data down  <br>00:20:32.840 to them and you say okay well I've also  <br>00:20:34.559 noticed that you have a husband and  <br>00:20:36.440 husband is a separate policy someplace  <br>00:20:38.120 else okay so let's let's get efficient  <br>00:20:40.360 here about cross- selling and we'll  <br>00:20:41.919 offer a family discount that's the easy  <br>00:20:44.039 stuff okay but then you start saying  <br>00:20:46.159 okay how are we going to separate  <br>00:20:47.280 ourselves apart and this is really where  <br>00:20:48.840 digital transformation kicks in because  <br>00:20:50.440 you then say right we know from the  <br>00:20:53.480 profile of the staff that that person  <br>00:20:55.840 maybe the CFO of the same company is a  <br>00:20:58.280 50 year old man and you know he's always  <br>00:21:01.720 asking about Family Insurance  <br>00:21:03.240 particularly maybe insurance for his  <br>00:21:05.120 father or something and then you go down  <br>00:21:07.000 that rabbit hole and you say okay his  <br>00:21:09.240 father is Alzheimer's he's no power of  <br>00:21:11.600 attorney with his father's data you  <br>00:21:13.720 think of where that medical data sits  <br>00:21:15.559 does it sit in a hospital does it sit in  <br>00:21:17.400 his in his pocket has a bunch of  <br>00:21:18.960 doctor's notes and can you digitize that  <br>00:21:21.799 and if you can digitize that then you  <br>00:21:24.159 can you're your that person can be  <br>00:21:26.240 authorized to maybe make decisions for  <br>00:21:28.640 father about his medication renewing his  <br>00:21:30.880 prescriptions anything like that so  <br>00:21:32.600 you're solving very very personal  <br>00:21:34.720 problems for people you're doing it in a  <br>00:21:36.799 very data efficient way and you're  <br>00:21:39.480 you're kind of going down the rabbit  <br>00:21:40.880 hole of of every individual need and  <br>00:21:43.600 that's how you kind of get you know  <br>00:21:45.320 loyalty and stickiness with these  <br>00:21:46.799 Platforms in a world of a million apps  <br>00:21:49.200 right it's the ones that you know really  <br>00:21:51.919 channel the life blood of people's  <br>00:21:53.880 problems is where you'll find the money  <br>00:21:55.919 and they will say if you if you solve  <br>00:21:57.320 one problem a person has on a recurring  <br>00:21:59.400 basis you'll make a couple of million  <br>00:22:00.720 dollars in in in those apps but it's  <br>00:22:03.200 just in those processes the ability to  <br>00:22:05.799 breathe life into following the data and  <br>00:22:09.440 solving those problems for everybody so  <br>00:22:11.919 then you say okay we sell  <br>00:22:14.159 insurance but you can self tailor that  <br>00:22:16.960 insurance the company is paying for your  <br>00:22:18.559 insurance but we're going to give you  <br>00:22:20.000 through our platform or through app the  <br>00:22:21.880 ability to really self- tailor that so  <br>00:22:24.360 you've got you've got a a a blanket  <br>00:22:26.440 coverage or you can maybe upself for  <br>00:22:28.720 blank coverage and here's multiple  <br>00:22:31.000 scenarios everyone typically has a  <br>00:22:32.919 mother or father or somebody that might  <br>00:22:35.400 be unwell or somebody that's just been  <br>00:22:36.960 born or you just never know but you can  <br>00:22:39.679 you can suppose those scenarios and then  <br>00:22:42.320 you can provide processes and data for  <br>00:22:44.640 that and then once you do that you can  <br>00:22:47.240 go further down the rabbit hole and say  <br>00:22:49.200 okay this person is a diabetic okay we  <br>00:22:51.320 should set up relationships with  <br>00:22:52.600 diabetic firms to get bulk purchasing of  <br>00:22:55.919 this and make it available through the  <br>00:22:57.200 app as well so now suddenly were a super  <br>00:22:59.159 app because we're we're ordering we're  <br>00:23:01.400 now a logistics company right we're  <br>00:23:03.480 ordering um you know insulin or we're  <br>00:23:06.360 ordering headache tablets or blood  <br>00:23:08.039 pressure tablets or whatever and then  <br>00:23:10.360 you know you kind of go down that route  <br>00:23:12.559 I looked at a project before where we  <br>00:23:14.279 wanted  <br>00:23:15.200 to revolutionize the concept of a first  <br>00:23:18.120 aid kit we wanted to make a first aid  <br>00:23:19.840 kit or the concept of a first aid kit a  <br>00:23:22.200 smart device in a home so you think of  <br>00:23:24.520 the tech involved in in um opening your  <br>00:23:26.799 phone uh with your face or recording  <br>00:23:29.559 your voice or whatever if you had a sick  <br>00:23:31.480 parent the machine could bleep for the  <br>00:23:33.679 parent to come along it could dispense a  <br>00:23:35.880 tablet record that person taking the  <br>00:23:38.440 tablet talk them through the process  <br>00:23:40.400 reorder if necessary because it's a  <br>00:23:42.200 secure device with with digital  <br>00:23:44.159 encryption and then you as a son could  <br>00:23:46.799 be sent a little video oh yeah Dad took  <br>00:23:48.440 his medicine soor great solved so that's  <br>00:23:51.720 kind of how you you you lean into a  <br>00:23:53.559 process like insurance which in in  <br>00:23:55.799 Insurance worlds can just be erased to  <br>00:23:57.159 the bottom it can be price price price  <br>00:23:58.600 and and what's available for what  <br>00:24:00.640 different profile of insurance level you  <br>00:24:02.360 have but there's so much more to it if  <br>00:24:04.559 you make it about the human then you  <br>00:24:06.919 wrap the process around the human then  <br>00:24:08.559 you've got a bigger Market got it okay  <br>00:24:12.960 so the way that you describe everything  <br>00:24:15.520 clearly very intelligent around that but  <br>00:24:18.480 and and as you as you explain your  <br>00:24:19.720 journey apart from being at the  <br>00:24:20.880 beginning where up in the attic there  <br>00:24:22.440 and not really having much money behind  <br>00:24:24.000 you and boardroom tables that are a  <br>00:24:25.480 little bit too heavy and so on  <br>00:24:28.760 talk to me about because we always talk  <br>00:24:30.159 about the winds don't we we hear a lot  <br>00:24:31.919 about how someone turned this into this  <br>00:24:33.559 into this and it was yes B an IPO and Y  <br>00:24:35.799 didly everyone got very rich but you  <br>00:24:38.360 also spoke about how when when you when  <br>00:24:40.640 you look at people that have said  <br>00:24:41.720 setting up companies the ones that have  <br>00:24:43.200 failed before okay if you've made the  <br>00:24:45.720 mistakes then you'll you you they've  <br>00:24:47.240 probably been costly in the early stages  <br>00:24:49.039 and so you've learned some really  <br>00:24:50.039 valuable lessons yes tell me about a  <br>00:24:52.440 business that you got involved with that  <br>00:24:55.360 you look back now and you're like I wish  <br>00:24:58.000 I never did that but I got some valuable  <br>00:25:00.039 lessons from it um yes uh I remember  <br>00:25:03.440 being on on uh the chairman on a minor  <br>00:25:07.159 shareholder in a in a project with Nile  <br>00:25:10.000 Horn you know from One Direction okay  <br>00:25:12.399 and uh it was in Nile Emoji so it was he  <br>00:25:15.799 consulted with our designers to create  <br>00:25:17.480 different emojis of his face all  <br>00:25:20.120 selected by him and signed off by him  <br>00:25:22.480 and then when he released his album uh  <br>00:25:25.559 it was I think it his first solo album  <br>00:25:27.240 maybe his second solo album  <br>00:25:29.120 um we released this at the same time  <br>00:25:30.919 with his Blessing like he was part he  <br>00:25:32.360 was a director in the firm and and a  <br>00:25:33.919 shareholder and we released it and it  <br>00:25:36.679 was a lot of work and it was a lot of  <br>00:25:38.480 advertising also amazing to see the  <br>00:25:41.360 power of celebrity endorsement because  <br>00:25:43.360 as soon as it went out on his Instagram  <br>00:25:45.640 and his Twitter and his Facebook at the  <br>00:25:48.360 time you literally you saw okay five  <br>00:25:51.399 likes 10 likes th000 likes 5,000 likes  <br>00:25:54.399 15,000 likes I've literally videos of it  <br>00:25:56.520 just it was just incredible that reach  <br>00:25:59.679 and uh you know because that was you  <br>00:26:02.520 know I knew some older celebrities being  <br>00:26:04.480 Ireland is a small place right you know  <br>00:26:06.039 some of the old singers and actors and  <br>00:26:07.399 so on but um the the kind of kidy Markus  <br>00:26:11.640 I'm watching The Power of of the act the  <br>00:26:13.600 hive of activity and so on but  <br>00:26:16.120 interestingly it was the day of the  <br>00:26:18.080 launch of the album people were  <br>00:26:20.600 delighted to by the album and then they  <br>00:26:21.960 complained like helled spending 99 cents  <br>00:26:24.120 on a set of emojis so our guys are  <br>00:26:27.279 watching this we're saying okay well  <br>00:26:28.480 we'll do a competition if you get you  <br>00:26:30.679 know 50 likes we'll send it to you for  <br>00:26:32.120 free kind of stuff and but it was just  <br>00:26:35.080 uh just did not work the whole thing all  <br>00:26:37.919 the work everything it just didn't work  <br>00:26:39.640 and and we thought we'd leverage the  <br>00:26:42.399 love that he has from the audience and  <br>00:26:44.440 so on and uh sorry now but um it just it  <br>00:26:49.480 helped reinforce probably his album  <br>00:26:51.039 sales so I'm sure he did well out of it  <br>00:26:52.640 but as a business I think it made about  <br>00:26:54.679 20 grand and it didn't it didn't cover  <br>00:26:57.200 anything at all um another one I had was  <br>00:27:00.640 was a takeaway from that you know you  <br>00:27:01.960 sat there and you know if you had to go  <br>00:27:04.039 back and do that again was that you  <br>00:27:05.320 learning that um the youngsters 999  <br>00:27:08.600 cents was just a step too much for them  <br>00:27:10.720 after buying the album or yeah I mean  <br>00:27:13.640 it's it's it's really about the power of  <br>00:27:16.080 the grow to Market strategy uh I'm not  <br>00:27:18.720 particularly adapt at thinking like a  <br>00:27:20.240 12-year-old girl and nor do I want to be  <br>00:27:23.000 um and but that's what it took to know  <br>00:27:24.919 if this was a good idea or not  <br>00:27:26.360 technically it worked beautifully  <br>00:27:28.679 integrated beautifully it was aligned  <br>00:27:30.799 brand on on point and on message all of  <br>00:27:33.360 those bits were absolutely right and you  <br>00:27:34.960 never know where the weak point is going  <br>00:27:36.600 to be and the weak point was in the  <br>00:27:39.279 acceptance of a 99 Cents purchase uh by  <br>00:27:43.240 by a 12-year-old fan and you just didn't  <br>00:27:48.360 get it do we didn't catch it and that's  <br>00:27:49.919 the go to market piece so and this  <br>00:27:52.320 happens very frequently with with  <br>00:27:54.640 technology-led startups they nail  <br>00:27:57.320 something new they do an amazing  <br>00:27:58.760 technical job of looking at something  <br>00:28:00.480 and and saying this is a brand new way  <br>00:28:01.960 of doing it but what they don't do is  <br>00:28:05.200 they connect it to the customer in in in  <br>00:28:07.880 the customer's terms and I suppose the  <br>00:28:10.000 lesson of that was doing it in a  <br>00:28:12.320 digestible way by the customer rather  <br>00:28:14.080 than what we thought they needed to hear  <br>00:28:16.039 or that we thought they wanted and  <br>00:28:18.360 sometimes you're inventing out of  <br>00:28:19.240 nothing so like here's a surprise thing  <br>00:28:21.080 same as an mden launch here's also an  <br>00:28:22.600 emoji go celebrate Nile didn't  <br>00:28:25.480 work interesting now  <br>00:28:28.760 how many how many startups have you got  <br>00:28:30.360 involved with if you count them in total  <br>00:28:33.000 oh uh 20 over the years and how many did  <br>00:28:37.399 you to choose 20 how many did you have  <br>00:28:39.960 come across your desk I'd love to be  <br>00:28:43.039 very strategic and say oh 700 in my team  <br>00:28:45.840 but up up until about three years ago  <br>00:28:47.679 I'd say I anything that came across my  <br>00:28:49.559 desk that I worked on um I I was  <br>00:28:52.440 involving in one way or other because I  <br>00:28:54.000 had a vicious appetite for but part of  <br>00:28:56.240 that process was consuming them to sort  <br>00:28:58.559 of go yeah it's never going to work and  <br>00:29:00.600 fine-tuning that process for myself and  <br>00:29:02.840 bringing people along in that process  <br>00:29:04.880 but very interesting when when covid  <br>00:29:06.880 happened and agency work diminished uh  <br>00:29:09.880 you know obviously because like we still  <br>00:29:12.480 had Nissan as a client I remember they  <br>00:29:13.799 rang me to say we haven't sold a car in  <br>00:29:15.679 six months you know and we need to  <br>00:29:17.159 reverse the project we were going to do  <br>00:29:18.919 but we'll talk to you later you can't  <br>00:29:20.760 blame anybody we had we had hotels we  <br>00:29:22.880 had Hotel kid out so you we went like  <br>00:29:25.279 this and then when the pandemic was over  <br>00:29:28.640 we accelerated through the roof we came  <br>00:29:30.080 up we gave free Consulting during the  <br>00:29:32.480 pandemic because I wanted to keep the  <br>00:29:34.240 people um it took a hit on balance  <br>00:29:36.600 sheets and so on but it meant that we  <br>00:29:38.559 were saying to our customers we'll give  <br>00:29:40.080 you free strategy free advice bit of  <br>00:29:41.799 technical support but remember us after  <br>00:29:43.480 the fact and and that's you know it came  <br>00:29:45.880 back with a vengeance so even when I had  <br>00:29:47.960 a a weak balance sheet on one agency the  <br>00:29:50.399 book of business came back with a  <br>00:29:51.480 flourish and it sold that on the up as  <br>00:29:53.159 well and that's another thing about  <br>00:29:54.799 selling is is the timing of of those  <br>00:29:56.840 sales but but  <br>00:29:59.000 um during the pandemic I put out a note  <br>00:30:01.720 on social media on LinkedIn and Twitter  <br>00:30:03.519 and so on to say in the spirit of  <br>00:30:06.039 everyone trying to help everybody uh and  <br>00:30:08.760 I had free time H I'm I'm willing to  <br>00:30:11.159 offer free half hour Zoom calls to  <br>00:30:14.200 anyone with a with a challenge or  <br>00:30:15.720 problem or to to fellow CEOs or  <br>00:30:18.320 entrepreneurs who would just wanted to  <br>00:30:19.600 talk I said the Only Rule was you're not  <br>00:30:21.799 LED sell to me I'm not alled to sell to  <br>00:30:23.320 you it's just a well met occasion where  <br>00:30:24.880 you can you can cry you can talk you you  <br>00:30:26.799 can do whatever and that was was  <br>00:30:28.880 fascinating to me I learned more about  <br>00:30:30.640 just you know I had CEOs on there who  <br>00:30:33.240 had you know a thousand people and  <br>00:30:35.720 suddenly they're literally told okay you  <br>00:30:37.799 you now need 20 people just to wind down  <br>00:30:40.279 the system to let everybody go and they  <br>00:30:42.519 find it hard looking in the mirror you  <br>00:30:43.880 know things of that I other on where you  <br>00:30:45.519 had a a 19-year-old saying I've got this  <br>00:30:47.720 great idea for Tech how do I engage the  <br>00:30:49.480 world and it's such a big answer you're  <br>00:30:52.600 like trying to break it down into  <br>00:30:53.919 meaningful chunks in an hour period of  <br>00:30:55.799 time to say well consider this first  <br>00:30:58.200 considered a second considered a third  <br>00:31:00.799 and the resistance to say go and get  <br>00:31:02.840 formal education before you try it  <br>00:31:04.519 because a lot of entrepreneurs don't  <br>00:31:05.960 want to do that they just want to get  <br>00:31:08.159 going um but then when I when I got more  <br>00:31:11.480 involved and I was kind of formerly  <br>00:31:13.559 chairman of a couple of these and it's  <br>00:31:15.120 easier to be an investment than a an  <br>00:31:16.760 investor than a chairman um I remember  <br>00:31:19.799 another instance a brilliant piece of  <br>00:31:21.200 tech too early to Market with a  <br>00:31:23.720 horrendous investor involved and the the  <br>00:31:28.120 damage I remember just trying to protect  <br>00:31:30.480 the startup team from that investor and  <br>00:31:33.120 he was taking finders fees for finding  <br>00:31:35.000 the money he was taking board seats all  <br>00:31:37.320 this kind of stuff he shall remain  <br>00:31:38.440 nameless but I remember this person  <br>00:31:41.360 would just in every board meeting just  <br>00:31:42.600 go on the attack because the CEO was  <br>00:31:44.600 young the COO were young they were the  <br>00:31:46.760 startup guys they were the the clever  <br>00:31:49.039 ones and this guy just no we need a  <br>00:31:52.039 50-year-old running that business you're  <br>00:31:53.840 terrible you're terrible and just attack  <br>00:31:55.440 attack attack and I would just spend the  <br>00:31:58.279 board meetings defending that person and  <br>00:32:00.919 and uh trying to find some kind of  <br>00:32:03.120 resonance be between people so again  <br>00:32:05.880 another weak point for a startup that  <br>00:32:07.279 you can't predict until you have the  <br>00:32:08.559 money and you're in flow and you don't  <br>00:32:10.880 expect it to be an internal problem you  <br>00:32:12.760 expect it to be the world connecting to  <br>00:32:14.600 the world is going to be the problem for  <br>00:32:15.919 the startups but it's a people game  <br>00:32:19.720 ultimately beay you to one of the  <br>00:32:21.440 property portals here in the UAE um I  <br>00:32:24.159 know the founders of that company and  <br>00:32:25.600 the parent company behind that wonderful  <br>00:32:27.559 human beings they have worked their ass  <br>00:32:31.159 off and I remember how long it took them  <br>00:32:33.639 to raise capital in the beginning now  <br>00:32:35.799 they're in a unicorn so they' done very  <br>00:32:37.399 well for themselves but I know the pain  <br>00:32:40.279 and I said to them you know what was it  <br>00:32:42.080 like at first and they went we were  <br>00:32:44.480 going to these these fundraising  <br>00:32:46.480 networking events and we went to a 100  <br>00:32:50.200 and we didn't know how to pitch MH we  <br>00:32:53.799 didn't know how to present we didn't  <br>00:32:55.639 really know what we were talking about  <br>00:32:57.720 and and it was after 100 events around  <br>00:33:01.559 that number that someone contacted them  <br>00:33:04.679 that had been at one of those events a  <br>00:33:06.080 few months earlier and that's where they  <br>00:33:08.480 got their first fund raise from they  <br>00:33:10.200 bootstrapped until then and I'm like did  <br>00:33:13.720 you just not know what you were doing  <br>00:33:15.240 they're like we didn't have a clue  <br>00:33:16.399 Spence we like genuinely didn't have a  <br>00:33:18.159 clue one of them one was at MIT the one  <br>00:33:21.120 was at Ox one was at cambrid super well  <br>00:33:22.760 educated people so you know all  <br>00:33:25.120 self-funded one was a finance guy one  <br>00:33:27.320 was a tech guy the other one was you  <br>00:33:28.840 know a marketing guy so and they're  <br>00:33:31.559 three brothers and so the trust was  <br>00:33:33.519 there and they're complimenting each  <br>00:33:34.799 other in terms of the skill sets was  <br>00:33:36.559 there um but none of them know what they  <br>00:33:38.919 were doing they look back on that now  <br>00:33:41.679 and they they're like it was just  <br>00:33:43.360 bloody-minded persistence that  <br>00:33:45.279 eventually got us there and I'm like had  <br>00:33:47.360 you known how to sell your concept sell  <br>00:33:49.960 your idea had you known how to genuinely  <br>00:33:52.559 build relationships and network with  <br>00:33:54.399 people what would be different they're  <br>00:33:56.679 like it would have been like is  <br>00:33:58.279 different yeah how often do you see  <br>00:34:01.000 entrepreneurs come to you that actually  <br>00:34:04.399 do have a good idea do have a good  <br>00:34:07.159 business they've started but just don't  <br>00:34:08.918 know how to verbalize it create a deck  <br>00:34:12.800 present it deliver it be passionate sell  <br>00:34:15.639 it essentially so that they can raise  <br>00:34:17.399 capital is that very frequent for you  <br>00:34:19.359 very frequent  <br>00:34:21.399 um the the very nature of what we've  <br>00:34:23.839 built in continuous Ventures now is  <br>00:34:25.760 we've got what's called A disruption un  <br>00:34:27.719 elligence team and that's all of these  <br>00:34:29.918 senior people that I used to make  <br>00:34:31.320 available every other Thursday in my my  <br>00:34:33.320 old instance of of companies we now have  <br>00:34:36.280 those people working full-time to  <br>00:34:38.159 support our Investment Portfolio and our  <br>00:34:40.119 startups and one of the big parts of  <br>00:34:42.879 their job is to reinforce any of the  <br>00:34:44.719 weak points that they see with anybody  <br>00:34:47.239 so you'll get superb technologists who  <br>00:34:50.520 like I say couldn't talk to a pretty  <br>00:34:52.000 girl or marketing person who can't  <br>00:34:54.119 explain a balance sheet or you know  <br>00:34:56.399 somebody who who won't understand why a  <br>00:34:58.920 particular color might be offensive in a  <br>00:35:00.440 certain territory if they're trying to  <br>00:35:01.680 sell it or things like that and you just  <br>00:35:03.839 never know where the weak points are so  <br>00:35:05.280 our team wrap themselves around those  <br>00:35:07.960 entrepreneurs to kind of make them as as  <br>00:35:11.440 copper fastened as possible on the  <br>00:35:13.040 journey so we see that every single day  <br>00:35:15.800 but it's not about oh that's not going  <br>00:35:18.240 to work because you're not the right guy  <br>00:35:19.760 to see this through I mean we've  <br>00:35:21.800 recalibrated firms in the past where the  <br>00:35:25.280 CEO is clearly not going to be you know  <br>00:35:27.240 you you get start of two two people one  <br>00:35:29.160 of them is the CEO right and you're like  <br>00:35:30.680 soly they're like LinkedIn I'm a CEO and  <br>00:35:32.440 director and it goes straight to their  <br>00:35:34.079 head and you're just like okay well what  <br>00:35:36.200 what oh you know we we um we do social  <br>00:35:38.920 media posts for a living you know that's  <br>00:35:40.760 that's our business but you look at them  <br>00:35:42.480 see look Le let's be frank you're not a  <br>00:35:45.079 CEO material but you're a brilliant  <br>00:35:46.880 Chief Innovation officer or you're great  <br>00:35:48.560 you're an ideas man or I mean we took  <br>00:35:50.760 one firm uh a couple years ago and we we  <br>00:35:53.240 recalibrated an an eight-year startup  <br>00:35:56.599 that had a patent and had a CEO who was  <br>00:35:59.240 tired and and a little begrudging that  <br>00:36:01.640 it hadn't gone better for him and we  <br>00:36:03.839 recalibrated moved him  <br>00:36:05.920 from Ireland where he was trying to  <br>00:36:08.359 Target um he was trying to Target the UK  <br>00:36:11.560 so we moved him into the region he was  <br>00:36:13.160 trying to Target registered a fresh  <br>00:36:15.040 company moved the patent and then re  <br>00:36:18.119 repositioned him as a Dyson type  <br>00:36:20.240 character he was like this is a new  <br>00:36:21.800 green startup with a full-time inventor  <br>00:36:24.960 then the interest came and that was  <br>00:36:28.160 pretty much the price of registering a  <br>00:36:29.680 firm and a little bit of message but how  <br>00:36:32.480 it was perceived by the market was where  <br>00:36:34.720 the secret sauce starts coming in  <br>00:36:36.160 suddenly you've got you know the same  <br>00:36:38.240 story told differently but now there's  <br>00:36:40.560 an appetite for it and it it kind of  <br>00:36:42.800 comes down you know the they say with  <br>00:36:44.560 the startups you know whether whether  <br>00:36:46.319 it's um luck or perseverance or after 10  <br>00:36:50.200 years in overnight success or any of  <br>00:36:52.040 this but you often hear this thing of  <br>00:36:54.079 fake it till you make it I don't believe  <br>00:36:56.280 in that for a second  <br>00:36:58.200 because faking it till you make it seems  <br>00:37:00.720 like Chancery seems like you're you're  <br>00:37:02.720 pretending you're worthwhile and then  <br>00:37:04.240 suddenly it might happen for you I from  <br>00:37:06.880 you believe in Project it then grow into  <br>00:37:09.359 that projection then project again grow  <br>00:37:11.160 into that projection again because it's  <br>00:37:12.839 driving yourself it's putting a future  <br>00:37:15.240 path there it's assuming success and  <br>00:37:18.000 it's not apologetic there's no imposter  <br>00:37:19.960 syndrome there's not anything that like  <br>00:37:22.079 oh thank God we got that deal or thank  <br>00:37:23.839 God they believed in us enough to sign a  <br>00:37:26.000 contract you're just saying I'm headed  <br>00:37:27.839 there who's with me it's a much more  <br>00:37:30.000 powerful message and then that means  <br>00:37:32.480 that you in in a technology firm or in a  <br>00:37:35.480 logistics firm or a data firm you're  <br>00:37:37.599 still putting people first the  <br>00:37:39.079 connection with the customer and your  <br>00:37:41.040 connection with the staff and and  <br>00:37:42.400 marrying those two things and uh you I  <br>00:37:45.920 think that's where the secret sauce in  <br>00:37:47.400 any of these startups  <br>00:37:49.520 lies interesting  <br>00:37:53.520 okay first of I'm going to ask this  <br>00:37:55.560 question because I know there's going to  <br>00:37:56.640 be a really great answer to this but  <br>00:37:58.960 before I ask the question let's give  <br>00:38:00.200 some context here you're you're a big  <br>00:38:02.000 fan of iido yes how long have you been  <br>00:38:04.400 doing Aikido for I started Aikido  <br>00:38:06.960 shortly after starting Continuum so  <br>00:38:08.800 would have been about 2003 okay I had  <br>00:38:11.040 done different martial arts but I had  <br>00:38:12.400 also been injured so I I took a break  <br>00:38:14.960 and then I took it up full-time in 2003  <br>00:38:18.200 what is  <br>00:38:20.000 iido uh what is aido so it's a Japanese  <br>00:38:22.760 martial arts form but it's it's um while  <br>00:38:26.599 it's full Conta  <br>00:38:27.960 it's designed to be a peaceful martial  <br>00:38:30.800 art so understanding the physics of the  <br>00:38:33.520 body the philosophy of movement the  <br>00:38:35.800 philosophy of solving Conflict by  <br>00:38:37.720 blending with conflict centrifugal kind  <br>00:38:40.480 of movements and so on it's it's really  <br>00:38:43.040 designed to be a living breathing  <br>00:38:45.000 martial art as opposed to clashing with  <br>00:38:46.800 something so what I'd have is you know  <br>00:38:50.200 um historically I did Ninjutsu I did  <br>00:38:52.920 Karate I did aido with Ninjutsu if  <br>00:38:55.839 someone tried to hit you over the head  <br>00:38:56.880 with an iron bar  <br>00:38:58.280 you they teach how to dislocate the arm  <br>00:39:00.280 right pretty violent pretty aggressive  <br>00:39:02.520 in Kempo they'd say here this is how you  <br>00:39:04.760 snap a block and you might hurt your arm  <br>00:39:06.960 but at least it's not your head in iido  <br>00:39:09.440 they say firstly as a guyy swinging down  <br>00:39:11.400 a bar at you don't be  <br>00:39:14.319 there and secondly see he's got he's  <br>00:39:16.680 gone to all this effort and all this  <br>00:39:18.319 energy to attack you why not manipulate  <br>00:39:21.160 that and redistribute it into the  <br>00:39:22.640 universe and get on with your life you  <br>00:39:24.520 know and when I say don't be there the B  <br>00:39:26.680 the best marshal is to not physically be  <br>00:39:28.800 there to recognize the signs that's  <br>00:39:31.040 Brewing over there so girlfriend let's  <br>00:39:33.440 go we walk out the door but if an attack  <br>00:39:36.480 comes to understand the physics of that  <br>00:39:38.920 motion and the little telltale signs you  <br>00:39:41.440 see in people to understand the  <br>00:39:43.640 aggression to understand the movement  <br>00:39:45.079 and then blend with it you know the best  <br>00:39:47.319 way to kill an enemy as sunu we were  <br>00:39:49.520 joking about sunsu earlier is to make  <br>00:39:51.480 them your friend it's the biggest way to  <br>00:39:52.920 evaporate an enemy so if you blend with  <br>00:39:55.079 an attack the attack disappears and  <br>00:39:57.560 that's kind of the philosophy behind the  <br>00:40:00.200 the physicality of iido and I think the  <br>00:40:03.280 this it was one of those things where as  <br>00:40:06.280 I got to know it and I got to practice  <br>00:40:08.200 it it just suited my mindset and it felt  <br>00:40:11.119 like it was kind of a a missing spine in  <br>00:40:13.760 the Journey of my life it kind of  <br>00:40:15.359 connected some significant points in my  <br>00:40:17.560 life and it just made sense it was about  <br>00:40:20.240 blending with things instead of classing  <br>00:40:21.920 with things it changed your tone of  <br>00:40:23.760 voice it changed how you if you took it  <br>00:40:25.760 in you know if it really meant something  <br>00:40:27.400 to you the kind of underlying concept of  <br>00:40:30.800 Bushido is life in every breath and how  <br>00:40:34.520 that translated for me into into life  <br>00:40:36.960 and then into business was be deliberate  <br>00:40:40.280 we're having a conversation I'm looking  <br>00:40:41.800 not looking at my phone we're having cup  <br>00:40:43.920 of tea we're enjoying the tea if we're  <br>00:40:45.560 doing Japanese archery look at the focus  <br>00:40:48.000 that they have in that it was just about  <br>00:40:49.880 being deliberate in the moment and being  <br>00:40:52.160 free to to really really appreciate that  <br>00:40:54.319 moment and it's something I've  <br>00:40:55.359 definitely applied to life it's  <br>00:40:56.520 something I've definitely applied to  <br>00:40:57.720 work and even the guys in continuous  <br>00:40:59.839 ventes would slag me that's you know I'm  <br>00:41:01.640 overusing the word deliberate but you  <br>00:41:04.040 know even the work is like is what we're  <br>00:41:05.760 doing on purpose can it be challenged  <br>00:41:08.160 can it be defended and these are  <br>00:41:09.800 questions the startups need to hear as  <br>00:41:11.240 well as well as being a human going  <br>00:41:13.640 through this process every single part  <br>00:41:16.240 of our business process has to be  <br>00:41:17.960 measured kpi defended qualified so then  <br>00:41:21.000 it moves through to different phases but  <br>00:41:23.160 certainly for my own life it made it  <br>00:41:26.920 made a lot of sense and probably solved  <br>00:41:29.560 things in me you know um that I was  <br>00:41:32.040 struggling with fear and and you know a  <br>00:41:34.640 history of being bullied and all these  <br>00:41:36.319 things that you can choose to set down  <br>00:41:38.880 over time if you if you address it  <br>00:41:41.880 correctly you know you you talk about  <br>00:41:44.280 being bullied but you're sitting here  <br>00:41:45.800 opposite me and we're worried about the  <br>00:41:47.839 legs being too tall on the chair because  <br>00:41:49.560 you're you're you're you're you're a  <br>00:41:51.000 giant of a man you're you know did that  <br>00:41:54.480 that kind of and and and I'm sure when  <br>00:41:56.160 you were younger you you were probably  <br>00:41:58.200 tall and skinny as opposed to being tall  <br>00:42:00.800 and Broad yeah I was I was a clumsy  <br>00:42:02.920 puppy big feet B hands so so how old  <br>00:42:07.319 were you when you started kind of like  <br>00:42:08.720 to fill out and start to become this the  <br>00:42:10.880 strapping kind of guy you are now well  <br>00:42:13.160 thank you for noticing  <br>00:42:14.800 uh I was is that a chat upline or  <br>00:42:17.400 something yeah did you get with that  <br>00:42:19.720 recorded um I was probably I was being  <br>00:42:23.160 extremely badly badly bullied um I had  <br>00:42:26.359 an older brother who was who was uh  <br>00:42:28.359 rather rather intense and wired wrong um  <br>00:42:31.760 so I was being bullied at at home when  <br>00:42:33.760 my parents were there my parents were  <br>00:42:35.520 amazing um both work fulltime to put us  <br>00:42:37.880 into private school so they were often  <br>00:42:39.640 not there H and uh my brother was was a  <br>00:42:42.880 tough not and in the spirit of healing  <br>00:42:44.680 through understanding I think he was  <br>00:42:45.960 bullied by his friends or certainly the  <br>00:42:47.680 weak one in his group so he used to take  <br>00:42:49.680 it out of me um but it just meant then  <br>00:42:52.480 that I was going to school feeling you  <br>00:42:54.839 know vulnerable and I used to have to go  <br>00:42:57.200 go through City Center in Dublin in a  <br>00:42:59.079 private school uniform through the the  <br>00:43:01.960 the kind of working class areas from the  <br>00:43:03.520 from the railway stations and so on with  <br>00:43:05.760 like a tin Whistler recorder sticking  <br>00:43:07.319 out of side and so it was fair game  <br>00:43:09.319 right to the neighborhood and then I get  <br>00:43:11.359 into class and you know you'd kind of  <br>00:43:13.240 put your cat and you go back to your  <br>00:43:14.559 desk and your bag is in the bin or  <br>00:43:16.400 there's chocolate over your it was just  <br>00:43:18.160 this  <br>00:43:19.319 ongoing you know mood I remember saying  <br>00:43:22.400 to my parents I really wanted to move  <br>00:43:23.680 school and when they drilled into it I  <br>00:43:25.599 couldn't admit I was being bullied I  <br>00:43:26.960 just just was trying to say because I  <br>00:43:29.559 just want to move schools I want to move  <br>00:43:30.800 schools I'm delighted I didn't and my  <br>00:43:32.200 parents were amazing about it I just  <br>00:43:34.559 never told them and then years later I  <br>00:43:37.920 was working on a book in Africa in 2008  <br>00:43:41.319 I think and I gave them the first draft  <br>00:43:43.440 and it was the first time I told him  <br>00:43:44.359 about what I'd been through and so on  <br>00:43:46.960 and uh I remember my dad God West was  <br>00:43:49.960 was really shocked had no idea you know  <br>00:43:53.200 and uh but so it culminated I got  <br>00:43:55.760 attacked one day my brother started  <br>00:43:57.440 smoking and he arranged for a guy to  <br>00:43:58.920 Ambush me with a knife pinned me against  <br>00:44:00.680 the wall I was like 13 and I froze  <br>00:44:03.480 completely froze and uh it's funny I can  <br>00:44:06.800 still remember now but I remember it was  <br>00:44:09.079 the freezing worried me more than  <br>00:44:10.559 anything else uh if the guy punched me  <br>00:44:13.200 or something that would have been  <br>00:44:14.240 probably easier uh I was playing rugby  <br>00:44:16.839 for school and so on so I was I I was  <br>00:44:19.359 tall so I couldn't not do rugby but I  <br>00:44:21.760 was uh when when something comes out of  <br>00:44:23.559 the universe and attacks you you can't  <br>00:44:25.079 rationalize that and it sat would me  <br>00:44:26.640 very bad  <br>00:44:28.400 um and they long story short about six  <br>00:44:29.800 months later of of worrying about that I  <br>00:44:32.200 I I stopped at a martial arts center on  <br>00:44:33.839 a Saturday and it was just these mixed  <br>00:44:36.640 various martial arts who' obviously  <br>00:44:38.000 taken a lease together and I I went in  <br>00:44:39.720 and it was Ninjutsu which is a very  <br>00:44:41.640 impressive gymnastic martial arts they  <br>00:44:44.040 were black they look cool it was like  <br>00:44:45.520 something out of the movies but I was  <br>00:44:47.280 still this nervous kid you know clumsy  <br>00:44:50.559 and and and and timid but I spoke to the  <br>00:44:54.680 the trainer afterwards and I I just went  <br>00:44:56.319 up and said look I don't want to do this  <br>00:44:57.359 or anything but can I just tell you I  <br>00:44:59.440 told him about what happened and I said  <br>00:45:01.079 can I how do you not freeze was the  <br>00:45:03.880 question basically I was kind of  <br>00:45:05.319 struggling to to get out and he just  <br>00:45:07.520 said look this people talk about fight  <br>00:45:09.599 and flight but it's actually fight  <br>00:45:11.000 flight and freeze and he said the the  <br>00:45:13.200 challenge is you'll always have the  <br>00:45:14.440 reaction you'll always be a freezer but  <br>00:45:16.480 you can learn to be switched on by it  <br>00:45:18.280 rather than switched off so the moment  <br>00:45:19.720 it happens you go you you move rather  <br>00:45:22.200 than freeze doesn't mean you haven't  <br>00:45:23.680 Frozen but you recognize the symptoms  <br>00:45:25.200 and off you go and I I I then went down  <br>00:45:29.119 the route of you know Ninjutsu and and  <br>00:45:31.720 Kempo and literally tournaments fighting  <br>00:45:33.760 and all this kind of stuff so built a  <br>00:45:36.200 pair of shoulders built a pair of arms  <br>00:45:38.160 had to run with my brother one time it  <br>00:45:39.680 was the last time he ever had to run  <br>00:45:41.000 with  <br>00:45:41.960 me and uh kind of built it out from  <br>00:45:44.319 there but I got that out of my system  <br>00:45:46.359 but very interestingly I became the kind  <br>00:45:48.040 of the anti-bully then if I saw kids  <br>00:45:49.839 getting bullied I'd step forward and you  <br>00:45:54.160 know it and it really helped me with  <br>00:45:55.880 with with work over over the years  <br>00:45:58.440 because I then start to antagonize  <br>00:46:00.720 because if things got violent I was kind  <br>00:46:03.040 of comfortable with that you know you're  <br>00:46:04.160 16 you're cocky then you have a chest  <br>00:46:05.760 and you feel like you're bulletproof but  <br>00:46:08.240 um you'd antagonize and then you'd look  <br>00:46:10.480 for the little nonverbal signs or the  <br>00:46:12.640 reactions and things like that you know  <br>00:46:14.200 you you'd see a guy going hell would you  <br>00:46:16.640 but he'd look around three people around  <br>00:46:18.400 him looking to be egged on or something  <br>00:46:20.559 and I found that piece absolutely  <br>00:46:22.280 fascinating the non-verbal piece and  <br>00:46:25.400 that's been a huge influence in in my  <br>00:46:27.559 life I even like when I watch the news I  <br>00:46:29.400 turn this the sound off and I just watch  <br>00:46:32.040 the politicians because they usually you  <br>00:46:34.400 know in a in a pressurized live  <br>00:46:36.440 environment trying to you know peacock  <br>00:46:38.440 or whatever they're doing and I just  <br>00:46:40.319 kept on watching for non-verbal cues  <br>00:46:42.720 which helped with martial arts because I  <br>00:46:45.319 you know I burnt out of the feir wasn't  <br>00:46:47.440 afraid of anything anymore so I can  <br>00:46:48.960 stand on the stage of 10,000 people now  <br>00:46:50.720 and you know not say boo it it doesn't  <br>00:46:53.480 bother me at all I played music any of  <br>00:46:55.680 these things I just in my write this now  <br>00:46:58.720 and again it was in the moment that kind  <br>00:47:00.960 of mindfulness not bringing anything  <br>00:47:03.359 else into it except for what I needed  <br>00:47:05.720 there and then you know I used to think  <br>00:47:07.520 of it like you know Newton's cradles  <br>00:47:09.359 those balls that go I used to in my mind  <br>00:47:12.480 I used to imagine I could just decide  <br>00:47:14.240 and they they'd just stop and start  <br>00:47:16.040 swinging together instead of clacking  <br>00:47:17.559 against each other and and that was I I  <br>00:47:19.599 I learn learned a phrase much later on  <br>00:47:21.800 called equipoise and it was just about  <br>00:47:24.359 that kind of centeredness and Stillness  <br>00:47:26.319 and so on it sounds a bit cliche but  <br>00:47:28.880 when you just decide okay this now and  <br>00:47:31.800 nothing else it comes to you that that  <br>00:47:35.040 that confidence and that that calmness  <br>00:47:37.079 and uh aido and Bushido that kind of  <br>00:47:39.839 philosophy just just sat with that well  <br>00:47:42.000 you know so that's kept me to this  <br>00:47:46.760 day for me it's trying  <br>00:47:49.400 to to  <br>00:47:51.599 take somebody who's been through an  <br>00:47:54.160 experience is taking on a martial art  <br>00:47:56.599 that's toughened him up he's then moved  <br>00:47:59.000 to another  <br>00:48:00.720 form and and then that form which seems  <br>00:48:03.880 like a a more as you as you describe a  <br>00:48:07.040 calmer um more thoughtful more flow  <br>00:48:09.640 inducing form  <br>00:48:12.119 and I can see how taken on the martial  <br>00:48:14.920 art at the beginning there potentially  <br>00:48:17.000 solved a problem and it was like I the  <br>00:48:20.559 freezing thing that I want to go there  <br>00:48:22.359 if that man can help me not freeze then  <br>00:48:24.520 that's that's the problem I'm trying to  <br>00:48:25.839 solve when when you look at businesses  <br>00:48:28.240 that you've built and you sold and ones  <br>00:48:29.520 that you've been involved with as well  <br>00:48:31.319 when you take on akido and its  <br>00:48:33.559 principles you talk about as you just  <br>00:48:35.760 said earlier deliberate okay so that's  <br>00:48:37.520 clearly something that's ingrained in  <br>00:48:39.280 you within within that that that that uh  <br>00:48:42.000 process that you  <br>00:48:44.520 apply do you find yourself watching  <br>00:48:48.119 People's lack of because you're so  <br>00:48:51.760 strong in your knowledge around does it  <br>00:48:54.160 do you understand what I mean that I do  <br>00:48:56.079 I do because to me it's kind of like  <br>00:48:57.799 that it's it's who you are so that that  <br>00:49:01.559 would make it almost like you could  <br>00:49:03.000 notice it so apparently to you when  <br>00:49:05.160 people and does it make you go okay he  <br>00:49:07.160 doesn't know this kind of stuff or does  <br>00:49:08.319 it make you go for goodness sake you  <br>00:49:10.880 donut yeah there's a bit of there's a  <br>00:49:13.079 bit of is that there's a bit of that I  <br>00:49:15.200 mean uh we had planned I hope he's not  <br>00:49:17.160 been with me yeah no no no no you're  <br>00:49:20.200 you're you're safe enough we're in a  <br>00:49:21.559 safe place safe place we had planned a  <br>00:49:24.559 Trilogy of books when I was working with  <br>00:49:26.240 an old friend friend of mine who's who's  <br>00:49:27.359 very sick now we can't we can't proceed  <br>00:49:28.920 with it but but we had decided on on on  <br>00:49:31.799 writing three books and the first one  <br>00:49:33.960 was called the tribe of one and it was  <br>00:49:35.359 about looking at because we're not  <br>00:49:37.079 qualified it was only philos philosophy  <br>00:49:39.280 it wasn't we're not qualified to go any  <br>00:49:41.160 deeper on it but we were just we did  <br>00:49:42.920 some work in Africa together we did some  <br>00:49:44.240 work in London together and we're just  <br>00:49:45.599 looking at people and watching people  <br>00:49:47.319 and you know you you'd watch you know  <br>00:49:50.240 Canary Warf at quarter 8 in the morning  <br>00:49:53.400 and you just see people running up a  <br>00:49:55.440 moving escalator and you know on their  <br>00:49:58.200 phone earphones and you just kind of  <br>00:50:00.520 wondering about how people see their own  <br>00:50:02.920 life and how they navigate through a day  <br>00:50:04.720 right and and what they don't do and  <br>00:50:06.599 what they don't stop to take in and I  <br>00:50:08.640 don't mean you know stare at the trees  <br>00:50:10.400 and and Forest bath or any of this stuff  <br>00:50:12.359 which is all amazing stuff but actually  <br>00:50:14.559 just are they given themselves a moment  <br>00:50:17.280 I mean one of the things I've enjoyed  <br>00:50:19.839 particularly after an exit is you have  <br>00:50:21.760 time in your day to think about your day  <br>00:50:24.160 not to think about what you have to get  <br>00:50:25.440 done you know I'm not you're a great  <br>00:50:27.960 early riser I mean you're you written  <br>00:50:30.359 the book on it by the time I see your  <br>00:50:32.440 Instagram post five hours has passed I'm  <br>00:50:34.559 like oh he's he's back from the desert  <br>00:50:36.040 already but you know I I'm I'm  <br>00:50:38.799 not but there's moments in my day  <br>00:50:40.960 there's waves in my day like I would  <br>00:50:42.240 only do email twice a week um I would  <br>00:50:45.480 only you know there's certain things I  <br>00:50:46.880 don't allow say that again because I  <br>00:50:48.599 don't think people would have picked  <br>00:50:49.680 that up you do emails twice a week yeah  <br>00:50:51.799 so I would have typically about two two  <br>00:50:54.640 hour Windows a week to do email  <br>00:50:57.680 I and that is the only time you would  <br>00:50:59.280 respond and Zend  <br>00:51:01.119 y consciously consciously deliberately  <br>00:51:04.079 like you if you email me you'll get an  <br>00:51:05.880 out of office saying you  <br>00:51:08.720 know in small Windows of time I'll be  <br>00:51:10.920 able to answer you but if here's an  <br>00:51:12.280 escalation process if it's something  <br>00:51:13.760 bigger I have an amazing assistant  <br>00:51:15.760 Sunshine hello but um it's it's just  <br>00:51:20.160 that's if I'm sitting at a desk I'm not  <br>00:51:21.599 doing my job really not and so you don't  <br>00:51:26.079 get moment  <br>00:51:27.520 you don't build energy you don't build  <br>00:51:29.280 teams you don't build resonance between  <br>00:51:31.040 teams by sending emails and so on in  <br>00:51:33.839 fact emails are usually after the fact  <br>00:51:35.480 when you're trying to catch things or  <br>00:51:37.160 blame things you know um when I was  <br>00:51:39.640 interviewing for the the dni team and  <br>00:51:42.040 and my partner column in continuous I  <br>00:51:45.079 was looking for extreme talent because  <br>00:51:47.200 we knew we we wanted to build a  <br>00:51:48.520 worldclass team and we knew they were  <br>00:51:50.200 all very very experienced people to  <br>00:51:52.720 people that I hoped I'd I'd struggle to  <br>00:51:54.799 interview because they were so good  <br>00:51:57.119 and and that's what I wanted I wanted to  <br>00:51:59.160 be the dumbest guy in that room as I  <br>00:52:00.680 said but I wasn't just looking at them  <br>00:52:03.000 from their extreme skill set are their  <br>00:52:05.280 extreme experience or perspective on the  <br>00:52:07.400 world I was looking at them seeing how  <br>00:52:09.160 would they resonate with another extreme  <br>00:52:11.720 person in another part of what we call  <br>00:52:14.040 the different lenses how we look at all  <br>00:52:16.319 of our deal flow all of these lenses  <br>00:52:18.720 design creativity data science quants  <br>00:52:20.839 everything they all look at anything we  <br>00:52:22.200 bring to the table and and bring if we  <br>00:52:25.200 if we commit to investing we bring bring  <br>00:52:26.680 that entrepreneur on the journey so it's  <br>00:52:29.000 how these people resonate with  <br>00:52:30.920 others and yeah you can sort of go right  <br>00:52:34.640 you look around and think oh I've got an  <br>00:52:35.920 advantage of you I've got an advantage  <br>00:52:37.000 of you but that's only if you're letting  <br>00:52:38.920 your ego trigger like you see those  <br>00:52:41.640 those little videos on on YouTube where  <br>00:52:43.960 you where the shark swins and all the  <br>00:52:45.400 fish avoid it all the time that's the  <br>00:52:47.520 that effect you'll end up being alone  <br>00:52:49.160 right you'll be of the Walk but you  <br>00:52:50.839 end up being alone because you're making  <br>00:52:52.760 it about you when you remove that and  <br>00:52:55.359 you make it about other people  <br>00:52:57.520 then things start to change and to me  <br>00:53:00.359 the most successful entrepreneurs that I  <br>00:53:02.000 see both the ones that are billionaires  <br>00:53:04.319 and the ones that are just starting off  <br>00:53:07.079 they're cam they're able to be  <br>00:53:09.200 comfortable around anybody they  <br>00:53:11.040 literally have that ability to what I  <br>00:53:13.119 call a network chameleon they they can  <br>00:53:14.680 kind of adapt and helps when you're  <br>00:53:16.440 talking about pitching and so on if I'm  <br>00:53:19.040 telling you about me I'm kind of failing  <br>00:53:21.240 the message here MH and it's that all  <br>00:53:23.200 that just people hate being sold to but  <br>00:53:25.280 they love buying you love to go in and  <br>00:53:27.319 say right there's a brand new car it's  <br>00:53:28.520 mine but you don't want the Slick guy  <br>00:53:30.000 going oh you'd look right in this sir  <br>00:53:31.839 you know saying you're allergic to that  <br>00:53:33.119 you go go away from me and but the more  <br>00:53:36.480 you blend with people the more you can  <br>00:53:37.680 adapt people and this is your language  <br>00:53:39.240 your framework um you I know you've  <br>00:53:41.760 you've talked to Chris Voss before he's  <br>00:53:43.480 a master in talking about mirroring and  <br>00:53:45.760 and making the conversation turning  <br>00:53:47.319 their own sentence on them again and  <br>00:53:49.720 again all of these tips and tricks help  <br>00:53:52.079 how you relate to people and then I'd  <br>00:53:54.559 always say there's two types of people  <br>00:53:55.920 in the world there drains and there  <br>00:53:57.400 radiators people who are exuding energy  <br>00:54:00.079 and other people who are just the room  <br>00:54:01.680 is empty with them in it and I don't do  <br>00:54:03.920 very well around  <br>00:54:06.200 drains that's fantastic okay um you  <br>00:54:09.599 recently moved to Dubai yes you've been  <br>00:54:11.640 here I think a few months now 108 days  <br>00:54:14.640 and you you came across a island and and  <br>00:54:17.280 and and you told me when we had the  <br>00:54:18.760 dinner that evening that you had sold  <br>00:54:21.720 everything moved here and bought nothing  <br>00:54:24.640 yep which seemed a little bit weird now  <br>00:54:27.760 I would I would I would suggest bought  <br>00:54:29.920 nothing whilst you're deciding what to  <br>00:54:31.720 buy maybe there there's a there's a  <br>00:54:33.520 reason for not but the Liberation that  <br>00:54:36.720 seemed to be in your eyes when you were  <br>00:54:38.599 explaining this to me at the time so can  <br>00:54:40.520 you just share that with me again and  <br>00:54:42.160 why did you do that and how does that  <br>00:54:43.599 feel well it it feels fantastic I mean  <br>00:54:46.960 you know firstly it was a nice exercise  <br>00:54:50.040 in in detaching from things so you you  <br>00:54:52.760 you you know has his cars and so on uh  <br>00:54:56.160 it it's nice to just shake all that off  <br>00:54:58.839 not even just from an operational point  <br>00:55:00.319 of view you know um but just from a a  <br>00:55:04.160 detached of of of feelings  <br>00:55:07.839 the sharing things with people is very  <br>00:55:10.200 very important and going through things  <br>00:55:12.440 with people are very important but like  <br>00:55:14.359 the last time I went back to duin I  <br>00:55:16.760 visited my my house which is now sold as  <br>00:55:20.160 well and uh it didn't feel like a home  <br>00:55:23.200 anymore and it was a very clear thing  <br>00:55:25.319 and it just reminded me that that was  <br>00:55:26.839 just stuff I actually pride myself on  <br>00:55:29.160 the stuff that I don't need I don't even  <br>00:55:30.720 have a car here or anything and uh it's  <br>00:55:33.599 just about my family now that will  <br>00:55:35.960 change over time because you know Dubai  <br>00:55:38.559 is lovely and there's lovely places to  <br>00:55:40.079 live and and and uh my kids want things  <br>00:55:42.799 and so on but as it stands currently  <br>00:55:45.240 granted I own Investments and companies  <br>00:55:47.280 and so on but that's all you know in a  <br>00:55:49.400 portfolio somewhere other than that I'm  <br>00:55:51.599 completely free and it's great and it  <br>00:55:54.039 just it just resets you and it reminds  <br>00:55:55.720 you that  <br>00:55:57.319 the people that are traveling with you  <br>00:55:58.680 and the moments you're going through are  <br>00:56:00.319 so much more important than stuff and  <br>00:56:02.440 stuff depreciates but people and  <br>00:56:04.680 relationships hopefully appreciate and  <br>00:56:07.359 just drives that point home to you the  <br>00:56:09.119 guy that's the founder of telegram Pavo  <br>00:56:11.680 I for what his surname he F he famously  <br>00:56:14.000 said in an interview he said I own  <br>00:56:15.319 nothing he said why would you want to  <br>00:56:17.240 own stuff like that it gets in the way  <br>00:56:19.000 of your freedom to be yeah I mean you  <br>00:56:21.799 you you made me struggle Z tell me to  <br>00:56:23.520 wear not a black T-shirt I literally  <br>00:56:25.400 just wear a black T-shirt every day I'm  <br>00:56:28.079 like this morning like what will I  <br>00:56:30.880 wear that was my biggest challenge you  <br>00:56:33.160 know  <br>00:56:34.000 yeah you've won some awards yeah when  <br>00:56:37.599 you win awards for the work that you do  <br>00:56:39.240 and I'll just I'll just make sure that  <br>00:56:40.559 we share these here with with amazing  <br>00:56:42.640 talented people not just yeah with  <br>00:56:44.599 amazing talented people when we talk  <br>00:56:46.000

win you win these award  <br>00:57:05.240 and how does it feel to win  <br>00:57:09.000 Awards uh I think it's because you went  <br>00:57:11.599 to Career recently yes I did yeah South  <br>00:57:13.839 Korea yeah three weeks ago that was we  <br>00:57:17.319 could do a whole podcast on that  <br>00:57:19.039 experience yeah and that was L you that  <br>00:57:21.319 was that was we we were in the National  <br>00:57:23.799 Assembly and was presented an award  <br>00:57:26.760 um for our kind of ethical Investments  <br>00:57:29.240 our ESG Investments for continuous  <br>00:57:30.960 investment continuous Ventures and uh so  <br>00:57:34.200 a lot of environmental stuff a lot of  <br>00:57:35.520 Medtech stuff Urban Tech things like  <br>00:57:37.160 that as well and we're moving very fast  <br>00:57:39.240 but that was very touching the welcome  <br>00:57:41.039 we got was very touching uh myself and  <br>00:57:43.039 the team were were all uh greatly  <br>00:57:45.599 received and um one of our client  <br>00:57:47.559 Investments was also won an award and  <br>00:57:49.839 Paul he was amazing um yeah it was funny  <br>00:57:54.240 I it was funny for me because I was so  <br>00:57:56.200 so far from Ireland and Ireland's a  <br>00:57:58.720 small place but it seems to get  <br>00:58:00.119 connected everywhere and we met with the  <br>00:58:01.720 ambassador to Ireland there and you know  <br>00:58:04.400 I wore a green tie on purpose and things  <br>00:58:06.440 like that you know my dad would have  <br>00:58:07.960 been proud and it was it was a nice it  <br>00:58:10.839 was a really nice uh occasion um when  <br>00:58:14.799 you when you win Awards I remember my  <br>00:58:17.319 first award was in 2003 I won best new  <br>00:58:19.839 internet ENT entrepreneur in Ireland H  <br>00:58:22.480 it was called the net Visionary award  <br>00:58:25.160 and uh on the night my parents were with  <br>00:58:28.039 me and I remember they said and the  <br>00:58:30.000 winter is I was sitting there my my  <br>00:58:31.880 probably rented tuxedo at the time and I  <br>00:58:34.559 remember my my my um fingers crossed  <br>00:58:37.240 like this and my head down and it was  <br>00:58:38.760 they were going through you know the  <br>00:58:39.880 finalists and a little profile of them  <br>00:58:42.400 and the winner is and I remember getting  <br>00:58:44.000 hit by this kind of wave of loneliness  <br>00:58:46.520 like nobody was going through this with  <br>00:58:48.000 me this wasn't significant for anyone  <br>00:58:49.640 else except for me and I remember  <br>00:58:52.680 carrying that feeling up on the side one  <br>00:58:54.319 and I I remember carrying that feeling  <br>00:58:55.480 up on the stage just going who that that  <br>00:58:57.440 actually feels really  <br>00:58:58.680 empty but those spider awards for  <br>00:59:01.599 example they I give credit to them  <br>00:59:04.160 completely to the staff that I worked  <br>00:59:05.880 with the teams that I worked with  <br>00:59:07.160 because I remember one of our clients we  <br>00:59:09.160 won a huge um spider award for them for  <br>00:59:12.599 best e-commerce  <br>00:59:14.680 in uh in England or the United Kingdom I  <br>00:59:17.319 think and it was a big deal and their  <br>00:59:19.280 marketing director was with us and she  <br>00:59:21.039 had a review the next day so I said here  <br>00:59:22.880 just walk in and plunk that on the desk  <br>00:59:25.160 so for them it was great stamps in their  <br>00:59:26.920 CV uh I think when you're when you're  <br>00:59:29.400 building  <br>00:59:31.000 companies you you only kind of you never  <br>00:59:33.680 really stop to to smell the roses you're  <br>00:59:35.760 always looking about you forget about  <br>00:59:37.440 what you've done well and you just focus  <br>00:59:38.799 on what of the next challenges and  <br>00:59:40.119 there's always more challenges right and  <br>00:59:41.680 there's always more things to do but  <br>00:59:43.680 those things they they force you to look  <br>00:59:46.480 around look look your teammates in the  <br>00:59:48.319 eye and toasted glass champ Pages we  <br>00:59:49.960 bloody dter and you know we have a ways  <br>00:59:52.319 to go yet but it's it's there's nice  <br>00:59:54.359 recognition um and some of the I I kept  <br>00:59:56.720 some of them just nostalgically um here  <br>00:59:59.520 as I say of nothing but I could a couple  <br>01:00:01.760 of those are in the office here in Dubai  <br>01:00:03.319 now as well is there something when you  <br>01:00:05.720 go back and and it doesn't matter which  <br>01:00:07.599 part of your life because it could be  <br>01:00:09.119 childhood as well but is there something  <br>01:00:11.920 that you weren't recognized for that  <br>01:00:14.960 still to this day sits in your mind and  <br>01:00:17.400 you wish you  <br>01:00:19.319 were uh I definitely being very honest  <br>01:00:24.200 and personal I definitely struggled for  <br>01:00:26.119 having an older brother really care for  <br>01:00:28.000 me and I definitely noticed that it  <br>01:00:30.079 meant that I responded to older people  <br>01:00:32.039 better which I think became a strength  <br>01:00:34.280 over time but but back then you just  <br>01:00:36.720 wanted your older brother to you know  <br>01:00:38.160 rub your hair and say he loved you and  <br>01:00:39.440 so on and we never had that relationship  <br>01:00:41.400 unfortunately um and even I remember  <br>01:00:44.079 seeing in school reports it would say I  <br>01:00:47.400 didn't really care about my peer  <br>01:00:50.000 feedback I was looking for the teachers  <br>01:00:52.000 feedback or you know U supervisors or  <br>01:00:54.359 things like that and uh you know in  <br>01:00:56.880 whatever way we get a we become a  <br>01:00:59.000 patchwork quilt as as I me our kind of  <br>01:01:01.920 construct over time that was certainly  <br>01:01:04.119 something I was I was more comfortable  <br>01:01:05.720 and more interested in older people  <br>01:01:08.359 generally um and I I think it it kind of  <br>01:01:11.079 worked like at 21 I was presenting in  <br>01:01:12.760 the boardrooms of IBM in Dublin and  <br>01:01:15.240 purely because I could create PowerPoint  <br>01:01:16.720 it wasn't because of my great great  <br>01:01:18.240 strategic thoughts I could just make it  <br>01:01:19.680 look Do  <br>01:01:20.680 It um and but I learned a lot about  <br>01:01:23.240 politics I learned a lot about you know  <br>01:01:25.359 middle Mar management you know silos of  <br>01:01:28.880 power and protection and all that kind  <br>01:01:30.160 of stuff and and I really really fought  <br>01:01:31.760 to make sure there was no politics or  <br>01:01:33.280 in any company I was involved  <br>01:01:35.200 with or anything that I built and even  <br>01:01:37.640 now if you looked at our our dni team  <br>01:01:40.440 we've we've got three teams in continus  <br>01:01:42.039 with have a partners team the the  <br>01:01:43.319 disruption intelligence team and then  <br>01:01:44.799 what we call client Partners who are the  <br>01:01:46.880 main principles of anything we invest in  <br>01:01:49.520 but when you look at the dni team which  <br>01:01:51.000 is our kind of Secret Sauce that's a  <br>01:01:53.079 circular team where they're all facing  <br>01:01:54.279 each other and the process goes through  <br>01:01:56.000 the middle of them their our lenses on  <br>01:01:57.720 the world and their job is to be a  <br>01:02:00.200 rising tide to anything they touch and  <br>01:02:02.799 we get to include them we get to bring  <br>01:02:05.839 them along on our journey we we we can  <br>01:02:07.839 focus on making them wealthy over time  <br>01:02:09.680 because we can make them shareholders of  <br>01:02:11.319 the things we invest in if they're  <br>01:02:13.599 subject matter experts in those areas we  <br>01:02:15.440 can we've our internal share a scheme so  <br>01:02:18.039 they their job is to be good for society  <br>01:02:21.200 is to bring the next generation of  <br>01:02:23.279 business of of an ethical investment  <br>01:02:25.920 it's not all ethical Essence we're not  <br>01:02:27.839 Saints either it's not our mandate it  <br>01:02:29.799 just happens to really suit how we see  <br>01:02:32.279 the  <br>01:02:33.000 world but they're a very motivated  <br>01:02:35.119 talented team that um it's a privilege  <br>01:02:38.400 when you get to handpick everyone you  <br>01:02:39.640 work with so you you can't take that  <br>01:02:41.880 privilege for granted you have to really  <br>01:02:43.680 really focus on that and make it about  <br>01:02:45.599 them not make it about you so even in my  <br>01:02:48.480 last uh in my last instance as as  <br>01:02:52.240 CEO um I did this um murf business  <br>01:02:56.359 school leadership training thing and to  <br>01:02:58.160 do this psychometric testing very very  <br>01:03:00.400 intense prism psychometric testing and I  <br>01:03:03.599 just gave I gave it to all the senior  <br>01:03:05.640 team and I said There You Go warts and  <br>01:03:07.440 all very vulnerable thing to do but  <br>01:03:09.359 again you know I said the better you  <br>01:03:12.160 understand this the better you can use  <br>01:03:13.160 me as a business tool so that's if you  <br>01:03:16.160 see my eyes rolling in the back of my  <br>01:03:17.640 head it's because of that weed Point not  <br>01:03:19.079 because it's me you know but to them  <br>01:03:21.640 they got the point is just like okay  <br>01:03:22.880 this is a very Frank relationship we're  <br>01:03:24.359 having here and it's the one thing I  <br>01:03:25.839 insist on with the guys we work with is  <br>01:03:28.200 be very direct be very Frank don't coat  <br>01:03:30.799 sugarcoat things because if you get this  <br>01:03:33.000 decision wrong for us we're in a lovely  <br>01:03:35.720 environment it's it's a a privileged air  <br>01:03:38.160 and and we get to work with amazing  <br>01:03:39.599 talent and so on but for the  <br>01:03:41.760 entrepreneurs coming through the the  <br>01:03:43.440 place quite often private equity and  <br>01:03:45.520 Venture Capital they go you oh you want  <br>01:03:47.160 our a couple of million Kiss the Ring  <br>01:03:48.640 here and so on but if you think of the  <br>01:03:52.319 emotional Journey a lot of entrepreneurs  <br>01:03:54.039 go through this could be their one Moon  <br>01:03:55.960 they could have given up the day job  <br>01:03:57.359 spent their savings and they arrive  <br>01:03:59.279 exhausted at our door so we say they're  <br>01:04:02.400 our customer and and treat them with  <br>01:04:04.559 emotional intelligence it is it's a it's  <br>01:04:06.640 a human game but you you have to treat  <br>01:04:10.400 them with emotional intelligence even if  <br>01:04:12.039 you know you're dealing with somebody  <br>01:04:13.359 who's brilliant and heavily on the  <br>01:04:15.319 Spectrum and you look at them and  <br>01:04:16.960 they're lightning in a jar and they just  <br>01:04:19.119 can't express themselves to you you  <br>01:04:20.760 still have to make it about you to  <br>01:04:22.520 connect with them and I think that's a  <br>01:04:24.599 very worthy challenge particularly when  <br>01:04:26.680 you have all these different lenses that  <br>01:04:28.440 mean we need to connect to that person  <br>01:04:30.079 in different ways to make them  <br>01:04:32.079 potentially successful investing is a  <br>01:04:34.200 very very Risky Business particularly  <br>01:04:35.760 with startups so what we're doing is  <br>01:04:37.559 trying to drisk that by creating fully  <br>01:04:40.119 evolved CEOs through that journey and if  <br>01:04:42.839 not we reserve the right typically in  <br>01:04:45.359 our structures to bring them on the  <br>01:04:47.279 journey but if we say look we need to  <br>01:04:48.559 put a CEO above you and you focus on  <br>01:04:51.440 your strength your power and this person  <br>01:04:53.119 will be a commercial person they'll  <br>01:04:54.520 worry about the day today you just focus  <br>01:04:57.799 on your Brilliance and let's bring that  <br>01:04:59.240 out of you you're still making it about  <br>01:05:01.079 them it's still a a learning experience  <br>01:05:03.680 for them and uh you know as I would say  <br>01:05:06.680 we're building a a wall Garden of trees  <br>01:05:09.839 okay and some of those trees will bear  <br>01:05:11.079 fruit some won't they'll die in the vine  <br>01:05:13.200 others will grow roots for five years  <br>01:05:14.760 and then suddenly spring up you just  <br>01:05:16.200 never know what the the mix of trees is  <br>01:05:19.359 going to be and they all need nurturing  <br>01:05:20.720 they all need care in different ways um  <br>01:05:23.039 and it once you put those entrepreneurs  <br>01:05:25.039 at the center that process I think  <br>01:05:27.200 you're you're kind of drisking the  <br>01:05:31.400 journey I get this  <br>01:05:34.680 sense that there's something you're  <br>01:05:36.640 trying to  <br>01:05:38.760 prove to some I don't know what and but  <br>01:05:44.200 your brother keeps coming up in my mind  <br>01:05:46.520 and I don't know why yeah well I mean  <br>01:05:48.799 you we've talked about him today I think  <br>01:05:52.400 um I think uh it's it's probably fresh  <br>01:05:56.240 cuz he passed away last year um it was  <br>01:05:58.640 he was quite unwell but he had an  <br>01:06:00.680 accident before he broke 18 bones fell  <br>01:06:02.599 out of a tree and so on so I was  <br>01:06:03.960 involved in helping him in in his life  <br>01:06:05.760 and sponsoring some part of his life  <br>01:06:07.760 even though we didn't really have a  <br>01:06:08.960 connection but it was just a in my head  <br>01:06:12.440 it's not this big emotional Gap now it's  <br>01:06:15.319 just a shame it's just a bloody shame  <br>01:06:16.960 let have gone for pin or more but the  <br>01:06:18.920 fact of the matter was he'd ring me  <br>01:06:20.039 whenever he needed money or we'd have  <br>01:06:22.640 the same conversation every time you  <br>01:06:24.640 know seemed like a nice guy his friends  <br>01:06:27.400 in where he lived in Florida loved him I  <br>01:06:30.680 even met one girl who who claimed that  <br>01:06:32.400 she saved his life when she was 12 he  <br>01:06:33.960 stopped her from drowning so I'm like he  <br>01:06:36.079 seemed to have a great life there he  <br>01:06:37.640 just didn't have it with us he left when  <br>01:06:39.240 he was 19 never came back to Ireland  <br>01:06:41.440 never left America again never did email  <br>01:06:44.359 never had a smartphone he was just  <br>01:06:45.760 really removed did gardening for a  <br>01:06:48.119 living and uh I just hop that he was  <br>01:06:50.400 very very happy in that he just didn't  <br>01:06:52.440 seem to need the connections with us you  <br>01:06:54.160 know and it's just a  <br>01:06:56.359 it's it's uh there's that kind of thing  <br>01:06:59.319 of healing through understanding you  <br>01:07:00.559 sort of go okay I know what it was more  <br>01:07:02.880 importantly I understand what it wasn't  <br>01:07:04.240 and possibly some of the reasons for  <br>01:07:05.599 that it's just a Pity I think we would  <br>01:07:07.599 have had some fun together and uh I  <br>01:07:09.520 think he would have enjoyed the journey  <br>01:07:11.400 uh a little bit more you know but I  <br>01:07:13.200 think the same about my dad my dad  <br>01:07:14.520 passed away three years ago and  <br>01:07:17.960 sometimes now like I kind of you know  <br>01:07:20.039 and like yeah Dad I'm on stage in the  <br>01:07:21.720 assembly in ker getting an award for  <br>01:07:23.319 being a global person I'm a big deal in  <br>01:07:25.520 South career now and my dad would would  <br>01:07:27.520 have reveled in that you know he really  <br>01:07:29.079 did and so would my mom so uh yeah it's  <br>01:07:32.160 just about you know you look back but  <br>01:07:34.160 you don't stare is is kind of how I look  <br>01:07:36.359 at it and you you um you bring the  <br>01:07:39.319 people that you care about along in this  <br>01:07:41.000 journey and you're hopefully open and  <br>01:07:43.279 sensitive to them the language you use  <br>01:07:45.279 should be uh blending with people not  <br>01:07:48.240 conflicting with them and uh you know  <br>01:07:50.359 every day is a a learning experience  <br>01:07:52.400 with different people and and the  <br>01:07:54.799 privilege of this job is I meet so many  <br>01:07:56.880 diverse kind of people I mean  <br>01:07:59.000 even on our dni team I think there's  <br>01:08:01.240 about 24 languages on the team and I  <br>01:08:03.680 think that's a great symbol of of of  <br>01:08:05.760 success and and and I don't mean  <br>01:08:07.559 diversity for diversity's sake this  <br>01:08:09.319 isn't like quota building in in a  <br>01:08:11.599 America or something it's just like it  <br>01:08:13.680 takes a certain kind of person to leave  <br>01:08:16.000 where they lived and and they're  <br>01:08:17.560 comfortable or it's safe and their  <br>01:08:19.040 family may be there to go somewhere else  <br>01:08:21.279 to work their ass off and you know you  <br>01:08:24.279 see that in the Middle East and  <br>01:08:25.960 particularly in Dubai in in in to such  <br>01:08:28.679 an extreme that I get so excited by the  <br>01:08:31.198 people I've met and the people have  <br>01:08:32.399 hired and even I've often found recently  <br>01:08:35.439 you know there there's been some jobs we  <br>01:08:37.158 filled and I'm like oh I wish we had  <br>01:08:39.679 three slots because I I find it very  <br>01:08:41.960 hard to to pick from those three people  <br>01:08:43.520 I hate to walk away from talent but we  <br>01:08:45.920 also have we're building out an agency  <br>01:08:47.439 one of our investments and we'll have  <br>01:08:48.960 200 people there by Christmas of next  <br>01:08:50.560 year I'm like oh let's genuinely keep in  <br>01:08:53.399 touch because I'll have a thing for you  <br>01:08:55.479 just not yet or just not for this team  <br>01:08:57.238 you know um and that's great that's you  <br>01:08:59.880 know so am I trying to prove  <br>01:09:02.799 anything no I think I think one of the  <br>01:09:05.359 reasons I moved here was for a big  <br>01:09:06.880 worthy challenge I wasn't about to go  <br>01:09:08.600 into business again life was pretty  <br>01:09:10.319 comfortable and I I didn't you know I  <br>01:09:13.479 wanted a big Market with a meaningful  <br>01:09:15.560 purpose and a real a big big audacious  <br>01:09:19.080 Challenge and my God we have we got  <br>01:09:22.560 us last question before I finish sir  <br>01:09:31.600 who do you care that you want to make  <br>01:09:34.759 proud of you who do I care oh my kids  <br>01:09:39.679 definitely um you want to be uh  <br>01:09:43.120 shoulders for them you know you want  <br>01:09:44.479 have you know you want to  <br>01:09:47.279 uh you want to have gone through your  <br>01:09:49.399 struggles in a way that when they look  <br>01:09:51.560 at what you went through um they can see  <br>01:09:54.920 that the journey and you know I I often  <br>01:09:58.600 say you know my wife to my wife and I  <br>01:10:01.239 say look we've done well but the kids  <br>01:10:05.159 are broke and we want them to learn to  <br>01:10:07.159 smell blood on their own because that  <br>01:10:09.440 kind of strength and resilience is a  <br>01:10:11.080 gift you give yourself you earn it over  <br>01:10:13.000 time and I'd really want that for them  <br>01:10:16.400 um I it there's very little else  <br>01:10:18.840 important to me you know some very close  <br>01:10:21.040 friends a an interesting and momentum of  <br>01:10:24.159 life and and you know My Little Secret  <br>01:10:27.520 Garden of Love and and and kids and so  <br>01:10:29.480 on and and that's kind of it you know  <br>01:10:31.320 it's it's you know you talk about  <br>01:10:33.520 detaching from stuff earlier yeah I've  <br>01:10:36.600 been I've been at occasions where you're  <br>01:10:38.679 trying to be all things to all people  <br>01:10:40.040 particularly when you're bootstrapping a  <br>01:10:41.840 an agency in an at in Ireland you know  <br>01:10:44.199 you kind of you're you're trying to be  <br>01:10:45.960 everybody's best friend and you you  <br>01:10:47.679 become very protective of your energy  <br>01:10:49.440 because you don't have the funds to to  <br>01:10:51.960 go and build a big amazing teams like we  <br>01:10:54.000 do now and  <br>01:10:55.760 you share your energy with people  <br>01:10:58.120 because you have to bring them along  <br>01:10:59.880 with you on the  <br>01:11:01.120 journey like you're giving Junior people  <br>01:11:03.480 big titles because you can't afford the  <br>01:11:04.800 big person you're trying to bring them  <br>01:11:06.080 along and I find excuse me that my  <br>01:11:10.080 energy um there's kind of two things  <br>01:11:12.679 that that frustrate me instantly I have  <br>01:11:14.520 a slow fuse when it comes to temper but  <br>01:11:16.880 two things frustrate one is crazy  <br>01:11:18.440 drivers so you know uh  <br>01:11:22.560 Dubai pick the wrong place for that oh  <br>01:11:24.960 yeah I I sit in the back and I work and  <br>01:11:27.000 I just say let's go that way which suits  <br>01:11:29.040 me too it's it's you know but um and  <br>01:11:31.880 then simple things having to repeat  <br>01:11:34.080 myself uh like simple things that have  <br>01:11:36.560 one function they can't do it like if a  <br>01:11:38.120 toaster doesn't work you know clock the  <br>01:11:40.159 thing bread doesn't go down clock it  <br>01:11:41.600 again right goes o|## SUMMARY  <br>Colin Meagle discusses startup potential, digital transformation, and personal philosophies
