Transcipt: "# http://tactiq.io/ free youtube transcript# you need this FREE CyberSecurity tool# https://www.youtube.com/watch/3CaG2GI1kn000:00:00.120 This cybersecurity tool isamazing. You need to deploy it.00:00:03.360 Not only is it free and open source,which I don't know how that's possible,00:00:06.570 but you're gonna learn so much abouthacking and security while also protecting00:00:10.500 your stuff. It's a no-brainer.00:00:11.760 I deployed the server in about fiveminutes and then deployed agents to all of00:00:15.066 my computers and servers,Mac, windows, Lennox.00:00:17.670 Now these agents are like the tattletalesin school. They tell me everything.00:00:21.270 Things like security configurationare all my devices misconfigured?00:00:24.240 I don't know, but I do Now it'll checkfor known vulnerabilities, malware,00:00:27.660 and then this is kind of nuts.00:00:28.950 It can track a directory and see if anychanges occurred, files added removed,00:00:33.090 documents edited, andthis is even crazier.00:00:35.100 It can track the changes to theWindows registry. Are you kidding me?00:00:38.130 It's amazing.00:00:38.820 So all these devices send all theinformation to my server and I can see00:00:42.030 everything from onelocation. I get alerts,00:00:44.430 which can come at me viaemail or Slack or whatever.00:00:46.800 I can do things in response tothose alerts. Active response.00:00:49.775 So not only can I detect a brute forceattack, I can do something about it.00:00:53.490 Block that IP, address. Thisserver or this tool is called waza.00:00:56.910 It's a type of cybersecuritytool called asim,00:00:59.190 security Information and Event Management.But I so badly wanna call it a siem.00:01:03.360 I'm gonna call it a siem. I don't care.00:01:04.800 This type of tool is what the blue teamor defensive side of cybersecurity will00:01:08.340 use to defend against the bad guys tostop the hackers. So on this video,00:01:11.910 I'm gonna show you how to deploy thiscuz you need to. It's amazing. Again,00:01:15.390 not only will you beprotecting your stuff,00:01:17.340 but you're gonna learn so much and it'salso kind of addicting. And seriously,00:01:21.210 this is something you could probably puton your resume. This is a project like,00:01:24.060 hey, I run my own seam,sim seam seam seams.00:01:28.740 Pretty cool, doesn't it? ,I That was lame. I'm sorry.00:01:31.830 So you're convinced, let's talk aboutwhat you need. Really only two things.00:01:34.740 A Linux server or computer and somethingto monitor. So other computers,00:01:39.570 most flavors of Lennox are supported.I'll be installing it on Ubuntu.00:01:42.840 And more specifically, I'll be on a cloudmachine in ano. That's what I prefer.00:01:46.860 So I can monitor everything withease and also it's ridiculously easy.00:01:50.520 I'll walk you through it here ina bit. But it can also be on-prem,00:01:53.010 on a server you already have. Orit can be on a Docker container.00:01:55.770 Lemme get some room here, alreadygot a room, scoot down. There we go.00:01:58.680 And they even have an ova foreasy deployment on virtual box.00:02:01.740 Now as far as systemrequirements for the Wza server,00:02:04.290 lemme show you what theyrecommend. At minimum,00:02:06.120 they want two gigs of RAM and two CPUcores. That'll work for most people.00:02:10.080 If you got a lot of devices, if you'regonna be collecting lots of logs,00:02:12.395 you wanna go larger. Four gigs ofRam and eight CPU cores. Now again,00:02:16.320 I'm gonna walk you through the cloudoption and then also sprinkle in a little00:02:19.110 bit of dog or two just for fun. Oh,almost forgot the most important thing.00:02:22.260 Coffee. Everything in it requirescoffee. It's just the rules.00:02:27.900 Network.00:02:28.110 Chuck.coffee first. All we'll setup. Waza or wsu, I'm not sure.00:02:31.230 I'm just gonna call it waza in the cloud.00:02:33.065 So let's head on over to http://od.com/networkchuck or check the link below.00:02:37.350 Now not only is LY nodethe sponsor of this video,00:02:39.540 but they are my favorite cloud provider.Like I'm not lying, check this up.00:02:42.450 I have way too many virtual machines inthe cloud because I just go in here and00:02:46.050 spin up something.Anytime I have a project,00:02:47.940 anytime I wanna mess withsomething, I just go to LE Node,00:02:50.460 spin up a quick virtual machine inseconds. Now if you're new to LE Node,00:02:53.760 this is gonna be free foryou. For the first 60 days,00:02:56.010 they're gonna give you $100 creditto go crazy and play around with it.00:02:59.140 So if you haven't already,00:02:59.920 go ahead and get signed up right nowand then get signed in and meet me back00:03:02.950 here.00:03:03.280 Now the other reason I love Le Node isthey make deploying virtual machines like00:03:06.130 waza. Super stinking easy. Check thisout. I'm gonna go to create Lin node.00:03:09.730 I'll click on Marketplace and thenI'll search for waza. There it is.00:03:13.390 Let's go and click on that and justhave it selected and we'll scroll down a00:03:16.215 bit.00:03:16.420 Now time for just a little bit of configFirst put an email address then for the00:03:19.810 SSL certificate. Then a limitedpseudo user account, Bernard hack.00:03:23.410 Well this can beanything. Just make it up.00:03:24.940 Put a password in and we'll scrolldown just a little bit until we see.00:03:28.600 Select an image. We'reusing Ubuntu Perfect region.00:03:31.450 Select somewhere close toyou. Leno is a cloud provider.00:03:33.430 So they have data centers everywhere.00:03:35.080 Pick somewhere close to you so it'llbe nice and fast. I'm in Dallas.00:03:37.960 And finally our LE node plan. Fromhere, let's click on share. At cpu,00:03:41.080 they're cheaper. And here we have ourplans or the size of our virtual machine.00:03:44.440 Now normally I would pick this oneright here. It's five bucks a month,00:03:47.320 super cheap. But for waza, you wantsomething a bit beefier, a bit bigger,00:03:51.010 something more like theLE node, four gigabyte.00:03:52.870 Now if you don't select the four gigabyteoption for this WASA installation,00:03:56.380 it just won't work. I tried http://it.so/ just make sure you select this.00:03:59.530 Now if you do wanna go for a smalleroption, like the LE node, two gigabyte,00:04:02.470 I actually got that working withDocker and it worked pretty well.00:04:05.170 I'll walk you through that here in asecond. Well, let's go ahead and do this.00:04:07.390 It's really not much more. It'sso easy. So select four gigabyte.00:04:10.330 Scroll down just a bit, labelthis sucker, whatever you want.00:04:14.140 Enter a root password.00:04:15.280 And finally we'll scroll down and clickon create LE node at the bottom right.00:04:18.790 Ready, set, go. Nowit's gonna do its thing.00:04:21.250 It's gonna bake you a VM inthe cloud. Quick coffee break,00:04:26.410 it'll be a few minutes. And once yousee that your LE node is running,00:04:29.830 we can try and connect to it. Overhere we have our SSH access command.00:04:32.980 We're gonna go ahead and copy thisright here and then launch your terminal00:04:35.770 Windows, Mac and Linux. It'll allwork. And paste that in there. Enter,00:04:39.340 accept all fingerprints. Putyour password in and we're in.00:04:42.550 But it may not be quite ready. Waza isstill going through its installation.00:04:46.060 We can monitor it kind of rightnow by typing in H top H T O P.00:04:50.530 And we'll see right at the top there,the top process. D P K G or D package.00:04:55.000 That's how apps on Linux are installedand that's what's happening right now.00:04:58.240 So we can kinda sit there andwatch that until that stops.00:05:00.645 And we can try to connect herein a moment and like see here,00:05:02.470 we have some wza stuff there. TheWZA index year is being installed.00:05:05.770 There's a bunch of pieces toit. It's amazing. But again,00:05:07.780 quick coffee break andwatch the magic happen.00:05:11.020 Now at this point it's been aboutsix minutes. Let's see if it's done.00:05:13.930 And we'll start with grabbingour password. By the way,00:05:16.090 I hit control C to get out of that,00:05:17.560 if we type in LS dash aland our terminal here,00:05:20.590 we should see a dot deploymentdash secrets dot txc file.00:05:24.670 There it has our secrets or ourpasswords. Let's go ahead and cap that.00:05:27.430 Cats dot deployment secrets,blah blah. Got it. Bam.00:05:30.280 There's our passwords right there.00:05:31.360 The first one we want is theadmin password at the top.00:05:33.580 Got our admin username and our adminpassword. Cool, keep that there.00:05:36.880 Let's go back to ourLE node dashboard here.00:05:38.650 And we're gonna grab our LE node reverseDNS name or R D N S. So here Leno node.00:05:42.880 Click on the network tab.00:05:44.170 Scroll down just a little bit untilwe see the IP addresses section.00:05:47.830 And then we have the reverse DNS righthere. There it is. Just go and grab that,00:05:51.850 copy it.00:05:52.600 Open a new tab and go to https colonwhack whack paste that in  .00:05:57.650 Here we go. It's there. Now let's getlogged in. Use your name admin password.00:06:01.700 Let's grab that from the terminalthere. It's copy and paste.00:06:05.870 It's gonna check and make sure thingsare good. Almost there or good. Awesome.00:06:09.560 This seems pretty cool. Last timeI'll do that joke. Probably not.00:06:13.310 Seems like a ock. Sorry .It's terrible. Now before we move on,00:06:17.180 I'm gonna show the dockerinstall. It's super easy.00:06:19.910 If you don't care about that,that's fine. Just skip ahead.00:06:22.015 I've got timestamps below. Nowhere's the docker install. Perfect.00:06:24.800 Four on-prem or a smaller machine on LEnode, which is what I'll be doing here.00:06:28.790 Leno. I'm gonna click on create le node.00:06:30.620 I'll just deploy a standardUbuntu 2204 lts machine,00:06:35.300 shared cpu. I know that the LEnode, two gigabyte plan will work.00:06:38.990 I tried it on the one gig, the containersjust wouldn't run. Don't try it.00:06:42.260 But the two gig plan, it worked http://great.so/ click that, label it something fun,00:06:45.560 put a password in and then click oncreate le node. How fast was that?00:06:49.340 Now if you're doing this on-prem,00:06:50.450 just have a server that's running Dockerand of course if you want to run the00:06:53.600 ova, I'll put a link below and wassdocumentation. After a moment or two,00:06:57.140 you should see that your machine isrunning. Let's go and connect to it.00:07:00.110 We'll grab our SSH access command overhere. Just copy that. Launch my terminal,00:07:03.830 paste it, head enter, accept allfingerprints, password. And we're in.00:07:07.730 Couple things we'll do real quick.First we'll update our repositories.00:07:10.250 Pseudo a P t update. Now many of you'regonna go, why is he doing pseudo?00:07:13.730 You're route. I always do pseudocause I don't know what you're using.00:07:17.330 You may not be root right now. I justwanna make it simple. Anyways, I digress.00:07:21.650 Pseudo PT update to update ourrepositories. Once that finishes up,00:07:24.830 we'll do a pseudo PT andinstall http://docker.io/ and docker00:07:29.630 dash compose. We'll doa dash y at the end.00:07:32.420 This is going to install dockerand Docker compose. So let's go.00:07:35.420 Should be fairly quick. More of a coffeesip here. Awesome, it is finished.00:07:39.650 The next step, I've got a link below.00:07:41.120 Go ahead and pull up the Wazadocumentation for a docker deployment.00:07:44.480 Well one two punch this real quick.00:07:45.800 First we'll clone the get repositoryone command. Let's copy that.00:07:49.100 Go back to your terminal, paste thatcommand assuming you have get installed.00:07:52.130 Most oss do clone. Awesome type in Ls.00:07:54.710 We'll see a new directorycalled waza Docker.00:07:56.960 Let's go ahead and CD into that cd,waza, Docker type in LS once more.00:08:01.280 And we have one moredirectory we wanna jump into.00:08:03.650 It's the single node directory becausewe're deploying one single node or00:08:07.250 computer cd single node. Perfect.00:08:10.520 Now the next thing we'll have to do isgenerate some self sign certificates.00:08:13.880 They make that super easy for us.00:08:15.145 They even have a Docker composefile to run and do that for us.00:08:18.080 And all we have to do iscopy and paste this command.00:08:19.820 So copy this command right here,paste that in there, hit enter.00:08:23.810 It's gonna pull those images down.Run, compose. And then that was it.00:08:27.410 That's done. Now for our next step,00:08:28.880 all we have to do is do thedocker dash compose command00:08:33.740 with the up option. And then we'll do adash D to launch it in the background.00:08:37.730 This will do everything for us. Thisis our last step in deploying this.00:08:40.700 It's super easy. I love docker. Ready,set, go. This will take a moment.00:08:45.320 It's deploying a multi-tierapplication, pulling all the images,00:08:48.740 a lot of stuff going on. Little coffeebreak. We'll give it some time here.00:08:51.740 Okay, deployment is done, done, done.00:08:54.110 Let's confirm real quickby typing in docker stats.00:08:57.780 Get a realtime view of those suckersrunning. Let's go get logged in.00:09:00.930 Let's check it out. We'll getback to our Leno dashboard here.00:09:03.360 Go to the network tab. Scrolldown just a little bit,00:09:05.640 find our reverse DNS name righthere in the IP addresses section.00:09:09.690 Go ahead and copy that and we'llopen up a new tab. Type in https,00:09:13.200 colon whack whack, paste that inthere. Let's go. Fingers crossed. Okay,00:09:16.800 this is a self-signed cert. We'll getthis little error message. No big deal.00:09:19.710 Should proceed. Was that sorry. Um,this video has so many lame jokes.00:09:23.460 Let's get logged in. Default. Login willbe admin password will be according to.00:09:27.660 Was it documentation? Whatwas it? Was it ? Sorry.00:09:32.400 Sorry, not sorry. Oh, it's uh, secretpassword. Capital S. Capital P.00:09:36.360 Easy enough. Just gotta check and makesure things are good. Almost. Okay,00:09:40.200 things are good. Now thatwe have, was it installed?00:09:42.720 Let's get some agents added.Computers that we can monitor.00:09:45.150 So right here we'll click on addagent right here in the dashboard.00:09:48.330 And then right here we'll havethe option to deploy a new agent.00:09:51.330 Go ahead and click on that. Thisis super straightforward and easy.00:09:53.760 We'll start with theLinux host first. Again,00:09:55.410 I'm gonna do Ubuntu and we'll doa Windows after this. By the way,00:09:57.990 Ubuntu 15 or more architecture is X 86.00:10:01.170 But notice we have optionsfor everything. It's awesome.00:10:03.690 Then we'll put our was aserver address in here.00:10:05.520 This will simply be your LE node,00:10:06.930 reverse DNS name if you did it withme or it could be an IP address.00:10:09.480 Just something that the agent can haveaccess to. So I'll copy that server.00:10:12.660 Address the F Q D N fully qualifieddomain name just like this.00:10:16.770 I will name that agent. It's optionalbut I like to Callie underscore Linux.00:10:21.300 We'll select a group. I'llput it in the default group.00:10:23.460 And then on step six they give you onecommand to install the agent. Super cool.00:10:27.180 Super easy. Let's copy that. Copy command.00:10:29.190 And then here in Cali I'll launch myterminal. Paste that command head,00:10:32.340 enter pseudo password and it's done.Cool. One more thing we have to do,00:10:37.260 getting back to the was a dashboard.We need to enable this as a service.00:10:40.385 We'll just copy this. Commandall system, CTL commands,00:10:42.870 paste those commands in there,head enter and done. Awesome.00:10:46.410 So now getting back to the WASA dashboard.00:10:48.270 We can go to the top left here onthis drop down and click on agents.00:10:51.390 There it is right there. My first littleguy, Callie Lennox, his IP address os.00:10:56.310 And it's gonna show us so much more.Oh, I can't wait to show you this,00:10:59.135 but first, before we do that,let's add Windows real quick.00:11:01.260 But notice how fast and easy thisis and Windows. It's just as easy.00:11:04.020 Let's go ahead and douh, deploy new agent.00:11:06.000 Once more this time we'llclick on Windows. Goodness,00:11:08.790 they still have WindowsXP in here. .00:11:11.280 I guess you need a scenefor this man. But anyways,00:11:13.500 I'm on Windows seven or more orgreater. No Windows arm support, sad,00:11:16.950 fully qualified domain name would be oursame. I uh, domain name or IP address.00:11:20.700 Again, just something your agent can haveaccess to. I'll name it default group.00:11:24.330 And finally at step six, just like Linux,00:11:26.430 we're gonna have our littleone-liner command using PowerShell.00:11:29.280 Keeping in mind you will need to runthis as administrator cause you will need00:11:32.580 admin privileges. So I'lljust copy that command,00:11:34.680 jump into my Windows computer here.00:11:36.870 So here in Windows I'lllaunch my Windows terminal.00:11:38.850 Keeping in mind I'll haveto launch it as admin.00:11:40.740 So right click this and click on run asadministrator. Pace my command in there,00:11:44.430 hit enter. Gonna do its thing.And then one more command.00:11:47.010 We'll have to start theservice here on Windows.00:11:48.990 Just like Linux net start was a SVCwas a is starting and we're off to the00:11:53.410 races. Let's go check Waza, the Wazadashboard. We'll go to our agents.00:11:56.710 Oh there it is. It's still coming up.00:11:58.330 Let's click on refresh over here onthe right. Refresh, refresh, refresh.00:12:01.420 Come on. Connect. I'm impatient.And after a billion refreshes. No,00:12:04.240 I'm just kidding. It was likethree. Um, it's up. Awesome.00:12:07.120 And here's our two machines at Lennoxand Windows. And you know what,00:12:10.540 I wanna add one morejust for fun. Ready Go.00:12:14.050 It was seriously actuallyalmost that fast.00:12:16.090 So here we have our agents and now let'sclick on one of these and see what's00:12:19.150 going on. This is gonna be http://fun.so/ I'm gonna click on the new one.00:12:21.280 I just added the Circs network. Chuck,that's from my CIRCS search video.00:12:25.780 It's a public box and it'sgonna be kind of fun to look at.00:12:28.065 It's click on that guy. And here's ouragent dashboard for this one computer,00:12:31.360 this one server. There's a lot going on.00:12:33.100 But just keep in mindat the top here in Waza,00:12:34.720 we kind of have breadcrumbsand I love this.00:12:36.520 We've got agents and we're drilled downinto the specific agent we're looking00:12:39.645 at. And then here at thedashboard, so much going on.00:12:42.430 Now I'm not gonna show youeverything. There's way too much,00:12:44.530 way too much fun to be had.00:12:45.705 But I will point out a fewthings that are like kind of wow.00:12:48.250 First the Mitre framework.The Mitre attack framework.00:12:51.340 We won't go too deep into this,00:12:52.510 but just know it's a database of hackingtechniques that hackers will use to00:12:55.720 attack machines. This will look atthat framework and tell you, Hey,00:12:59.710 your machine might be vulnerable to this,00:13:01.840 these tactics or your machine isactively being attacked in these ways.00:13:06.190 And notice, um, some thingsare happening to mine.00:13:08.470 We'll take a look at those here ina bit. And then quick drive by here.00:13:11.350 Compliance. Many companies have to obeycertain compliance standards like pci,00:13:15.145 gdpr, nist, hipaa. This willcheck all your computers,00:13:18.580 all your servers and tell you what'sgoing on. That's kind of crazy. Now,00:13:22.270 you may not care about policies. Youshould if you wanna get into security,00:13:25.000 but it may not be important foryou right now. Scroll down a bit.00:13:27.100 What about configuration? Is your serveror your computer configured securely?00:13:30.490 Do you know that for a fact?Well this will tell you .00:13:33.070 It has a module called SCAor secure configuration.00:13:36.370 I think it's audit or assessment,secure configuration assessment.00:13:39.610 And it will pull out a C I S assessment.00:13:42.040 This is for buntu Linux andtell you how good you are. Um,00:13:44.770 39% on my score failed 715 of these.00:13:48.040 Now let me give you like kind ofa baseline for what that means.00:13:50.020 Let's jump into this report.Notice here in the breadcrumbs,00:13:52.000 I did jump into the security configurationassessment section and it'll tell me00:13:55.480 all the things I failed at. Let meactually sort by. Uh, good stuff.00:13:58.750 It's gonna be a small list. Andmost of this is like default.00:14:00.970 So like App Armor is installed cool,00:14:03.010 but it'll go deeper and tell you thingslike hey you should disable USB storage.00:14:05.860 If that drill down to SSH cuz you cansearch for specific things like that.00:14:08.740 Keyword . It'll tell me thingslike, hey don't install Telenet.00:14:11.860 U F W is not enabled.Disable ssh sh root login.00:14:14.920 So not only is it showingyou like hey you're insecure,00:14:17.080 but it's also teaching you. Causeif I click on any one of these,00:14:19.420 it'll tell me like, Heyhere's the rationale, here'swhy we're telling you this.00:14:22.360 Here's how you fix it,here's how you check it.00:14:24.520 And then it shows you all the miretechniques that can be used against having00:14:27.765 that misconfiguration. That's sofreaking powerful. Are you kidding me?00:14:31.270 It's okay, I'm getting a littleexcited coffee, you'll calm me down.00:14:35.440 That's just one module speed mode. Let'sget back to our agent dashboard here.00:14:38.890 Here on the menu we have security eventsshowing you things like authentication00:14:41.800 failures, which could be brute forceattacks. It'll show you top five alerts.00:14:45.280 It'll give you a list ofsecurity alerts. Super powerful.00:14:47.890 And then here's something you're notgonna see right away. If I click on more,00:14:50.770 we have vulnerabilities.00:14:52.580 It'll check your system forvulnerabilities but it'snot enabled by default.00:14:55.400 I'll show you how to dothis here in a moment.00:14:57.230 But I have another system I alreadyhad up and running and if I look at00:14:59.870 vulnerabilities for that one,00:15:01.490 it's gonna check all myapplications and tell me like, Hey,00:15:04.310 are there known CBEs out thereor common vulnerabilities?00:15:07.640 And I've got a bunch  likea lot. But just look at this,00:15:11.300 deploy this for your house or yourservers or whatever you have and play00:15:14.390 security admin. Go in here and go,oh wow, I've got 170 critical CDEs.00:15:18.680 I should go figure out how to fixthose. The learning opportunity.00:15:21.740 Are you kidding me? And then hereon my server I already had going.00:15:24.260 I do wanna show you one thing here on oneof my Windows hosts or Windows agents.00:15:28.400 This is kind of fun. I have my daughter'scomputer here, this is amazing.00:15:31.010 Check this out. I'll click on Chloe.00:15:32.720 And the one thing you're gonna loveabout Windows Host is the integrity00:15:36.170 monitoring module. Oh my gosh,thing's amazing. Check it out.00:15:39.830 The sucker's gonna monitor all theimportant files and registry keys that are00:15:44.360 normally modified whensomething's being hacked.00:15:46.400 It's gonna look at things and tellyou when things are being adjusted.00:15:48.830 So like check this out. If I go to events,00:15:50.570 it'll tell me each time aregister key is changed.00:15:52.550 Like this one was deleted firewallpolicy. I don't know why that happened.00:15:55.640 Now some of these are automatic,like the Windows OS is doing it,00:15:58.370 but others can be bad. It's gotta crazy.00:16:01.580 And it's not just registry keys.If I go to inventory over here,00:16:03.950 I can see that it hasinventory of the files,00:16:05.390 it's monitoring and all the registry keys,00:16:07.190 it's monitoring and what they'recurrently set to. Is it not insane?00:16:09.890 And here in a moment I'llshow you how you can s uh,00:16:11.575 monitor specific keys and get alerts onthose keys and files too. It's so fun.00:16:15.950 Now at this point your seamseems to be doing great. I lied,00:16:19.220 I was gonna do it one more http://time.it/ seems to be doing pretty good.00:16:21.260 Pretty much all youhave to do is set it up,00:16:23.060 connect an agent to it and it collectsinformation and you can go crazy and00:16:26.750 learn cybersecurity andstart to protect your stuff.00:16:29.660 But you can also tinker with this quitea bit. You can enable more modules,00:16:32.690 set up more alerts, monitor morethings. So if you're interested in that,00:16:35.815 we're gonna walk througha few more options here.00:16:37.910 Now the first thing we'll do is lookat file monitoring through Windows.00:16:41.120 It's so powerful and so cool. Soback here at the WASA incense,00:16:44.810 I deployed with youright now in this video.00:16:46.700 Couple things real quick justbefore we jump into that.00:16:48.530 If I click on the home icon,00:16:49.610 it's gonna take me to the WASA dashboardand it's gonna show me like all the00:16:52.040 modules I could jump into. So for example,if I wanna jump into security events,00:16:55.340 it's gonna show me security events.00:16:56.480 But right now it's beingfiltered to look at one agent.00:16:59.030 I can unpin that to where it's showingme everything from every agent.00:17:02.270 That's pretty cool. And you can do thatwith most modules. Let's go back home.00:17:05.060 Now let's click on Waza oncemore. Will Waza drop down here?00:17:08.030 Let's click on agents. Now again,I'm not going over everything.00:17:10.940 Every little thing you can do and youdon't have to know all these things,00:17:13.520 but you can play aroundwith it. You can go crazy.00:17:16.310 I'm just giving you enough to getstarted and have a little bit of fun and00:17:18.710 things I got really excited http://about.so/ let's click on agents here.00:17:21.170 We'll click on my Windows machine.00:17:22.640 A couple things I'm gonnashow you real quick.00:17:23.960 If I click on Integrity Monitoring,00:17:25.339 this is the module thatwe'll use to monitor files.00:17:28.160 Notice I don't have any events right now.00:17:29.540 I've got it filtered right now by thelast 24 hours and I've just connected this00:17:32.900 thing, nothing's happened.But if I go to the inventory,00:17:35.240 I can see that it already has scannedand inventoried all the default files.00:17:39.260 It'll look for in thedirectories. And my registry keys.00:17:41.600 I believe it's set to scaneverything every 12 hours.00:17:45.020 And if it notices a change, it'll letyou know. It'll alert you. Pretty cool.00:17:47.870 But with files we can also do realtime notification and rule set.00:17:51.450 Check this out.00:17:52.290 I'm gonna jump into my Windows host andchange some configuration for the agent00:17:55.830 file. Now you can find that here.I'm gonna go to my Windows Explorer,00:17:58.530 go to my C Drive, goto program files X 86.00:18:01.440 Now if this is all like weird foryou, like oh man Windows file system,00:18:03.990 I don't know what's going on.00:18:05.190 I do detail a lot of what this meansand how it's organized in my Windows00:18:08.910 Fundamentals course on my academy.Check it out, link below. Anyways,00:18:12.120 let's continue. It's an X 86 andin a folder called OS sec Agent,00:18:16.920 jump in there. Continue.You gotta have admin access.00:18:19.680 If I scroll down just a bit,I'll see a file named os http://sec.com/.00:18:23.430 That's your configurationfile for your agent.00:18:25.320 Let's go to open that with notepad.Open with notepad. Oh, by the way,00:18:28.920 you can do the same thing on Linux.I'll put documentation below.00:18:31.980 It's pretty much the same process, justediting the same type of agent file.00:18:35.430 But let's walk through thisreal quick here in this file,00:18:36.930 I'm just gonna search for sis checkto get to the SIS check section.00:18:41.760 That's hard to say.. And here right uh,00:18:44.100 you can see that I have the fileintegrity monitoring section.00:18:47.040 And you can see right here all thedirectories that is by default set to00:18:50.760 monitor.00:18:51.390 So what we'll do here is we'll justchoose a place amongst all these directory00:18:54.515 options and we'll add alittle configuration here.00:18:57.570 We'll type in directories and we'lladd an option that'll give us real time00:19:00.630 alerts. It's really simple what'scalled real time, just like that.00:19:04.025 Have it equal yes in quotes.00:19:05.310 We'll add one more optionreport underscore changes.00:19:08.400 Have that equal yes in quotes andwe'll add one more check underscore00:19:13.140 all and have that equal yes as well.00:19:15.780 So just to make sure we'reall on the same page here,00:19:17.370 we're specifying a directory and we'regiving it these options real time. Yes,00:19:21.150 report changes, yes. And checkall. Yes, we'll close that out.00:19:24.510 And then add the directory. We'regonna monitor with all these options.00:19:27.330 Let's see to our desktop.00:19:28.140 So we'll do CE colon slashusers slash your username.00:19:32.520 Mine is network check slash desktop.00:19:35.220 And then we'll close that out with aleft arrow forward slash directories just00:19:39.900 like this. So now we'llsave this file, file save.00:19:42.060 And then we'll restart the service bylaunching our terminal as administrator.00:19:44.940 Right click run as administratorand we'll say restart service.00:19:49.140 Dash name waza. http://cool.so/ that should be good.00:19:52.140 So I'm gonna open up myWaza dashboard real quick.00:19:53.850 Make sure I'm on the events tab.Notice and look at the last 24 hours,00:19:57.060 nothing's happened. Let'schange something on our desktop.00:19:59.460 This is so cool and powerful. I hopethis illustrates how cool this is.00:20:02.250 She's gonna go to my desktop and I'mgonna add a new file, new text document.00:20:06.210 Can you see this? Just takeabout five seconds. One, two,00:20:10.830 let's take a look. Let'srefresh this. .00:20:15.030 There it is. No, it's weird.I said added, deleted, added.00:20:17.850 Oh I think because they changedthe name in real time. But look,00:20:20.070 it monitored that I add a new, uh, anew file. Um, check this out. So that's,00:20:23.190 that's one alert. If I change anythingabout it, let's open it up. Say, Hey,00:20:27.090 I'm changing stuff. We'll save it,we'll see if the new alert comes in.00:20:30.030 I'll refresh my optionshere or refresh my page.00:20:32.520 There it is sis check eventmodified. And it's like, Hey,00:20:35.670 the check sum changed on this.00:20:37.350 It'll even tell me down herewhat I changed the text Iadded. How crazy is that?00:20:41.880 Now we can do the same kind ofthing with the Windows registry.00:20:44.070 Now it won't be real time,they don't have that option,00:20:46.590 but it will scan every 12 hours.You can change that interval.00:20:49.300 Let me share real quick. We can http://specify.so/ right now Pilic was an inventory,00:20:53.170 right? We can see that it does havean inventory. Look at our new file.00:20:56.710 It does have an inventory of registeredkeys that automatically monitors,00:20:59.920 but we can add specific onesthat we want to have seen.00:21:02.050 So let's add a custom one real quick.00:21:03.460 I'll open up a red edit herein Windows to edit my registry.00:21:07.090 Let's add one inside. Uh, I don't know,hq, local machine. We'll go to software,00:21:11.440 maybe classes. And let's add oneright here, right click say New key,00:21:16.420 we'll say Bernard Hack. Well bam,00:21:20.080 we'll change the value to something fun.00:21:22.780 So what I'll do here is I'll right clickthis key and say copy key name and then00:21:26.590 we'll go back to ouragent configuration file.00:21:28.960 And you'll notice just under that samekind of section where we're adding00:21:31.660 directories, we also haveregistry keys we can add.00:21:34.240 So I'll go kind oftowards the bottom here,00:21:35.860 just underneath the last registry entryand right before the entry to ignore,00:21:41.590 I'll line myself up with everythingelse, type in Windows registry,00:21:46.390 paste my key name,00:21:47.680 and then close it out with a left arrowforward slash Windows registry and a00:21:51.730 right arrow. Cool, thatshould be all we need.00:21:54.100 And it'll change thefrequency cuz like I said,00:21:55.900 it's gonna take 12 hours to findthis. We don't want it to do that.00:21:59.110 So up here we have frequency that CIScheck is executed by default every 1200:22:03.280 hours. 43, 200.00:22:05.200 Let's change that from thatto 60. So every, every minute.00:22:10.060 Actually let's do 30 seconds. Let'sbe quick. So I'll save this file.00:22:14.290 I'll restart my service. My was aservice to once some more restart.00:22:17.410 Service name was a Got it go. Cool.00:22:19.570 So getting back to our WASA dashboardhere in our integrity monitoring section00:22:22.870 for our Windows machine.00:22:24.130 I'm gonna go over here to inventory andjust see if it finds that new registry00:22:26.800 key. I'll go to registry, I'll searchfor, what do we name it Bernard?00:22:31.660 Nothing yet. Way for it to findit. There it is right there.00:22:34.510 So it found the key. It's lookingat it, it's monitoring it. Cool.00:22:37.660 Now let's go to events. Now you seethat we've got some registry changes,00:22:40.600 mainly time and we're getting thatbecause we were setting it to every 3000:22:43.420 seconds. Notice nothing about aregistry key here. Let's go change it.00:22:46.210 Let's go modify it. Hammer Bernard, hack.00:22:47.805 Well I'll change the valueto something else. Fun00:22:52.930 or you got hacked. Cool, let's changeit there. It'll take about 30 seconds.00:22:57.280 Take a little coffee break andlet's monitor our was the dashboard.00:23:00.610 I'll refresh it a few times. And ohthere it is. Register key modified.00:23:04.540 How killer is that? Now you may bewondering, okay, big deal Chuck,00:23:07.870 I'll barely even know there.But when does registry is,00:23:09.615 why do I care if it'schanged? And first of all,00:23:11.260 the registry like has these settingsfor the configuration of your operating00:23:14.620 system. So if things are changedhere, it's changing everywhere else.00:23:17.860 Some common things you might seechanged, especially with malware.00:23:20.530 Is this key here? Does it seem MicrosoftWindows? Where's it at? Where's it at?00:23:25.450 Windows Current version. There'sa lot of keys in here man.00:23:28.480 And we have run and runonce these keys are changed,00:23:31.630 when you add like a new startupapplication for your system.00:23:33.910 So what malware will do is I'll go inhere and add a new key new string value.00:23:37.810 Call this, I'll call this bad stuff andI'll just say internet explorer .00:23:42.705 Let's, let's copy that location.Okay? And looking back at Waza,00:23:46.580 it does monitor that by default. Andhere in the events, if I refresh it,00:23:50.180 there it is. Registerkey added and modified.00:23:53.090 There's the name of it right there. Badstuff. That's pretty powerful, right?00:23:56.600 The next thing I wanna show you actions.They're so powerful. Check this out.00:24:00.530 Let's go to our agents here and I'lljump into my Linux machine here.00:24:04.070 Circs Network, Chuck. Now let's go tosecurity events and I'll jump to events.00:24:07.730 Now there'll be a lot of eventshere because this machine's public.00:24:10.010 Now I'm getting things like attemptto log in using a non-existent user.00:24:13.430 Getting Bruteforce from Russia usingthe user name Pie . That's funny.00:24:18.230 Anyways, we can do something with that.And actually I wanna try it myself.00:24:21.800 I'm gonna try in brute force,00:24:23.030 I'm gonna launch my Callie Linux machinehere and I'll use hydro to brute force00:24:26.270 the login and I'll use theusername, uh, Bernard Hack.00:24:29.185 Well and we'll see ifit sees us. Ready, set,00:24:32.150 go after a pseudo password. Herewe go. Okay, it's attacking.00:24:36.530 We should see a log. Let's go look atthe logs here. Security events. Events.00:24:40.760 This happened just now. Let'ssee if it was us. Use your name.00:24:44.330 Bernard Hack Wall. So there,there we are. How cool was that?00:24:46.910 Let's stop that nonsense. Let's realquick. See if I try to log into it. Okay,00:24:51.565 so I, I'm getting a passwordprompt so I'm not being blocked.00:24:53.960 So clearly I can sit here and just tryand try and try again to my heart's00:24:57.410 content.00:24:57.950 But what if I had our seam activelyrespond to that and add it to the block00:25:02.450 list, drop it, add it to the firewall.We can do that. Check it out.00:25:05.750 It's called active response, whichcan be used for so many things.00:25:08.480 But I wanna demo this realquick. Now, to change this,00:25:10.490 we're gonna go to theconfiguration of our was a server.00:25:13.040 So we're gonna go here to the was a menu,00:25:14.480 go to management and thenclick on configuration.00:25:17.150 From here we're gonna go to the topright and click on edit configuration.00:25:20.420 And we're gonna scroll down a bit untilwe see a section called active response.00:25:24.170 Actually, you know, why am I tripping?I'm just gonna search for it.00:25:25.910 Active response. Cool, thereit is. Active response.00:25:28.670 So scroll down a bit untilI see this right here.00:25:31.520 It's kinda giving you a formatfor what it should look like.00:25:33.980 And I'm gonna copy this config fromthe documentation. Thank you Waza.00:25:37.940 Check it out here. Command is firewall,drop location, the server. It's uh,00:25:42.355 the rule is executing on and then it'sgonna look at a rule or it's looking for00:25:45.355 a rule. This rule is whattriggers this firewall drop.00:25:48.140 Now when we tried to brute force whatrule was triggered? Let's go find out.00:25:51.620 I'm gonna jump to uh, ouragents. Go back to my circ Circs,00:25:54.980 go to security Events. Events andlet's see, it was just earlier, right?00:25:58.675 Like at 33. Yeah. So here's the alert.You can see yes, it was Bernard Hack.00:26:02.780 Well and there's the alert IDright there. The rule ID 57 10.00:26:07.130 That's what we want it to alert off of.00:26:08.780 So let's go back to our configurationthing here and we'll change that rule from00:26:12.590 57 63 to 57 10 and this willtime it out or add the firewall00:26:17.360 rule. And the time outhere is 180 seconds.00:26:19.610 It'll block the attacker for 180seconds. Pretty cool. So let's save that.00:26:23.540 Click on save, restart our manager. Justgive that a little, little bit of time.00:26:27.380 Here're starting, please wait,coffee break. Okay, it's restarted.00:26:31.790 Now what we wanna do nowis go back to our agent,00:26:33.710 go back to Search network Chuck andwe'll go to security events and go to00:26:37.760 events. So last thing we saw agentstarted and stopped. Refresh that. Okay,00:26:41.570 we're here now let's go and tryto brute force it one more time.00:26:44.100 Actually real quickly, see if we canlog in. So this time I'm gonna use Root.00:26:46.980 I know a real user on that system.Let's see if it lets me. Okay, so we're,00:26:50.460 it's allowing us right now. Nowwe don't have to brute force.00:26:53.070 We can just try to login with Bernard Hack.00:26:54.630 Well what that should do is trigger.Now it's right now it's 1203.00:26:57.870 It should trigger that new activerule. Let's go see. Bam. There it is.00:27:02.190 So 1203 attempt. Attempt to log inwith non-existent user. Bernard Hack.00:27:06.120 Well immediately the firewall at dropactive response blocks me. So now,00:27:10.890 right now for 180 secondsanyway, if I even try to log in,00:27:14.105 even with a real user, Iget nothing. I'm blocked.00:27:18.570 I can't even ping it., it's kinda crazy.00:27:21.210 Let's do a continuous ping and see whenit lets me out outta jail here. Oh,00:27:25.500 we're back. We're back. Okay, so howcool is that? And just so you know,00:27:28.710 you can do those active responses basedon a variety of rules. It's so custom.00:27:33.095 That's why this is so powerful.00:27:34.350 You can even do it off of like a certaincommand was run or a certain log came00:27:38.670 about in, in the system you can run aa, an active response. It's so crazy.00:27:43.740 Now two more things I wanna show youreal quick. First is vulnerabilities. Um,00:27:47.280 right now if I go to my search network,Chuck and I go to Vulnerabilities.00:27:51.300 Nothing there. Why? Becauseit's not enabled by default.00:27:54.270 The system does not search for that. Soit's really, really easy to set this up.00:27:57.750 We'll go to waza management configuration.00:27:59.940 Just like before we'llgo to edit configuration.00:28:02.070 And here we're gonna search forvulnerability detector. Right there.00:28:06.605 It tells us enabled. No,let's change that to yes,00:28:10.680 we definitely want that. Then we clickon save and restart Manager, confirm now.00:28:15.000 So once this restarts, noticethe options it has here.00:28:17.880 It'll run a full scan every six hours.00:28:19.680 It'll also run on Start when the servicestarts up. So once this finishes,00:28:24.090 we'll restart our service and Windowsand Linux and see what happens. Okay,00:28:27.815 cool. It's done there.I'm gonna go to Windows,00:28:30.030 restart my service here andwe're restart my service here.00:28:32.550 I restarting was at Agents.Cool. So now at this point,00:28:35.880 and if we check our agents, I'lljust go to my Windows machine here,00:28:38.340 go to vulnerabilities. Cool. Soscan's complete, didn't find anything.00:28:42.210 Now the reason for that is that my Windowsmachine has like no apps installed on00:28:45.660 it,00:28:45.750 but just know to enable the vulnerabilityscanning you have to enable it on the00:28:49.470 system, on the Waza server. But theagents have that configured by default.00:28:53.250 Now if I go back to my other server thathas all kinds of fun stuff configured,00:28:57.300 I gotta get logged back in here.Chloe, she has a bad version of vlc,00:29:00.990 media player, high severity cde.Wow, look at that, dude, this is fun.00:29:05.520 Gives you all the details ofit. Oh my gosh, it's so cool.00:29:08.280 But I wouldn't have known that if Ididn't have this on her system and it just00:29:11.340 tells me automatically.00:29:12.780 Now speaking of telling you automaticallyyou'll need some sort of alert, right?00:29:16.740 Waza has that. They've gotemail alerts and Slack alerts.00:29:19.380 I'm gonna show you Slack realquick. How to set that up.00:29:21.570 The first one I'll do is open on Slackand create a new channel just for waza00:29:25.170 Waza alerts.00:29:27.870 Now I'll go out to Slackand create a new app.00:29:30.990 Now this will not be a tutorialon how Slack apps work.00:29:33.870 I'll just walk you through the basicsyou need to know about right now.00:29:35.970 And this goes without sayingyou do need a Slack account.00:29:39.270 So I'll click on create new appfrom name it was uh, alerts,00:29:44.080 select my workspace, create the app.00:29:46.210 And then all I wanna add really isan incoming webhook. Activate it.00:29:49.300 And then at the bottom I'll clickon add new webhook to workspace.00:29:52.720 I'll click on new channel WazaAlerts Allow. And that's it.00:29:56.920 And all I need from this is thiswebhook url. I'll copy that,00:30:00.250 get back to my Wza dashboard.00:30:02.440 And I'm gonna go back tothat configuration pagewhere we were at before where00:30:04.660 we spent a lot of time. Clickon Wza, go to management,00:30:07.395 and then go to configuration. Same thingas before. Click on edit configuration.00:30:10.900 And here I'm gonna search forintegrations or just integration.00:30:15.340 And it looks like I don't have asection for that. I'll just add it here.00:30:18.130 So I'll just go to the top and just underglobal and I'll paste this config from00:30:22.330 the documentation.00:30:23.440 The only thing I'll change hereis pasting my webhook right there,00:30:26.230 which I need to copyagain, paste it there.00:30:28.360 And actually there is one more thing Iwanna change just in case you don't wanna00:30:30.975 be killed with alerts because this default setting will have a bunch of00:30:35.470 alerts sent to me basedon like all the events.00:30:37.840 And of course you can change the severitylevel of events that are sent to you00:30:41.260 or even just specify a specific ruleID you're looking for. So for example,00:30:46.000 right underneath here I can addrule id. And what do you say we do?00:30:50.110 57 10. That same rule as earlier that weare doing the action roll off of. Cool.00:30:54.850 So we have our web hook in place,00:30:56.260 the url we have our rule to alert offof Save it, save and restart manager.00:31:00.610 Once that is restarted, we'll doour little test here in a moment.00:31:03.070 And real quick, look, there'snothing in the uh, waza alerts yet.00:31:06.250 It's kind of quiet here.Cool, it's restarted.00:31:08.320 Now let's try and log in withBernard Hack. Well again,00:31:13.900 that should block us. Andthen over here, BAM was alert.00:31:18.105 Actually hit my watch too. Was I alert?Look at that invalid user. Bernard Hack.00:31:22.690 Well, from this IP address, which I'mgonna have Nick or Austin block right now,00:31:27.610 that's awesome, right? So, okay, this isprobably a long video, I realize that.00:31:32.020 But waza is a powerful tool that willnot only help you protect your family,00:31:36.220 your own lab, your business, butit'll teach you a ton about security,00:31:39.940 about hacking about Blue team and thefact that it's free and open source that I00:31:43.450 just did all of this, it costs menothing except for the hosting,00:31:46.900 which you could do it on-prem,it's gonna be free for you.00:31:48.880 It's just kind of crazy.00:31:49.750 So I hope you have as much fun with thistool as I have and we'll continue to00:31:53.020 have fun with. Let me know yourthoughts below. What do you think?00:31:55.720 Let me know how your was ainstallation, implementation went.00:31:58.540 I wanna know all about it.Anyways, that's all I have.00:32:00.520 Thank you for joining me in this video.00:32:02.260 Thank you for having alittle bit of coffee with me.00:32:04.000 I'll see you in the next video."
