**If a failure is painful, it gets fixed.**  
**If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored**==

  

==**When the consequences are severe, people learn quickly**==

  

==**The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behaviour**==

  

==**We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that makes them hard to abandon**==

  

==**Increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behaviour**==

  

==**There can’t be a gap between the action and the consequences**==

  

==**The strength of the punishment must match the relative strength of the behaviour it is trying to correct**==

  

==**Behaviour only shifts if the punishment is painful enough and reliably enforces**==

  

### The Habit Contract

  

==**Just as the government use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can create a habit contract to hold yourself accountable**==

  

==**A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through**==

  

==**Then you find one or two people to act as your accountability partner and sign off on the contract with you**==

  

==**To make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them painful in the moment**==

  

==**Creating a habit contract is a straightforward way to do exactly that**==
