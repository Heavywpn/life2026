For the third year in a row, Trip Machine and Urban Rider have joined forces to create a collaborative capsule collection. This year’s collection is all about integrating Trip Machine’s signature leatherwork with another material that is synonymous with durability and character: heavy-duty waxed canvas.

If owning a motorcycle in London has taught us one thing, it's that you carry a lock with you at all times and you make sure your pride and joy is secure before you walk away. Disc locks are the most elegant solution but the better ones out there are still bulky and heavy affairs. It is a very bad idea to keep the disc lock in your jacket (you don't want to be hitting the tarmac with a lump of metal in your pocket) but we can't always be bothered to carry a bag with us everywhere we go. Based on how quickly last year’s Lock Boxes sold out, you seem to agree with the sentiment!

This is why we have designed this convenient Roll-top Lock Carrier that can be mounted to the subframes of most modern classic bikes out there and is the perfect size to house the vast majority of disc locks on the market today. The main body is made of sturdy canvas which is waxed on both sides for extra water resistance, with a sumptuously soft blue lycra lining that is water-resistant of its own accord. The Lock Carrier mounts to your bike with the included sturdy leather straps. A third strap also attaches to your bike and holds the top of the carrier in place. This design stops the box from wobbling every time you take a turn and keeps things in place although not all bikes will require you to attach this.

Of course you aren’t limited to carrying locks in this nifty little bag. It would also be a brilliant place to keep your waterproofs. Or your sandwiches.

You are responsible for securely mounting the carrier to your bike. Make sure there is no chance of it getting pulled in your wheel.
