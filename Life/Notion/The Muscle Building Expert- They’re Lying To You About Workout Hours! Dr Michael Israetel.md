efficiency is key.- Many common fitness myths hinder progress, including the need for extensive gym hours.- Recovery and nutrition are just as important as the workout itself for muscle growth.- Psychological factors significantly impact motivation and adherence to fitness routines.- Gym anxiety is a real concern that affects many newcomers to fitness.- Effective plans for muscle gain can be tailored to individual goals and lifestyle constraints.- Two to three sets of targeted exercises can lead to substantial muscle growth.- The right warm-up can enhance performance and prevent injuries during workouts.- Meal timing and nutrient quality can influence overall health and muscle growth.- Sustainable habits are crucial for long-term weight maintenance after reaching fitness goals.- Caloric intake and expenditure are fundamental in managing body weight effectively.- Muscle growth is primarily stimulated by tension, not solely dependent on the workout environment.- Resistance training can be highly effective even with minimal equipment at home.- Many people underestimate the role of good technique in maximizing workout effectiveness.- Body image perceptions can influence workout motivation and self-esteem in fitness enthusiasts.- Eating disorders are complex and not solely caused by calorie awareness or food labeling.### INSIGHTS:- Achieving fitness goals requires a balance of consistent exercise and proper nutrition strategies.- Many individuals mistakenly think extensive workout hours are necessary for noticeable results.- Muscle memory allows individuals to regain strength faster after periods of inactivity.- Effective muscle training relies on both physical and psychological readiness before workouts.- Regularly revisiting and adjusting fitness goals can enhance motivation and prevent burnout.- Sustainable dietary habits are crucial for maintaining weight loss and overall health.- The quality and timing of meals can significantly affect physical performance and recovery.- Strength training can be accomplished effectively with minimal equipment at home.- Psychological barriers often impede progress in fitness; addressing these can improve outcomes.- Understanding the science behind muscle growth can motivate individuals to stick with their routines.### QUOTES:- \"Doing this at home will give you phenomenal overall results with not so much time investment.\"- \"The consistency that matters doesn't matter if it's 2 hours a week or 18 hours a week.\"- \"Every real working set should be challenging.\"- \"You can get amazing benefits with minimal time investment.\"- \"Nutrition for being more lean, more muscular, and healthier... has all these kinds of ideas.\"- \"Muscle growth occurs when your body is resting, not during the gym session.\"- \"If you don’t lift for 2 weeks, you start to lose muscle.\"- \"The average person will burn something like 100 to 150 calories per mile run.\"- \"Diet has a bigger effect than exercise; it’s easier to control dietary intake.\"- \"Sustainable habits lead to long-term success in maintaining weight loss.\"- \"Fitness won't elevate your status as a better person in some way.\"- \"Training at home is a bit of a different world but can yield amazing results.\"- \"You can get into really good shape with not so much time investment.\"- \"You don’t grow muscle at the gym; you give yourself a signal to grow muscle.\"- \"Calories in, calories out is incontrovertible for the vast majority of people.\"- \"Muscle dysmorphia often leads individuals to underestimate their actual muscle mass.\"- \"You can eat regular foods and still achieve great fitness results.\"- \"The muscle memory effect allows you to regain size faster after a break.\"- \"Eating disorders are influenced more by genetic and social factors than by calorie awareness.\"- \"You should be training for hypertrophy with a focus on good technique.\"- \"Diet fatigue can lead to the perception of needing to be perfect in weight loss.\"### HABITS:- Consistently assess and adjust fitness goals to stay motivated and aligned with personal desires.- Incorporate strength training sessions two to three times a week for optimal muscle growth.- Utilize a balanced diet that includes protein, vegetables, and healthy fats for muscle recovery.- Prioritize sleep and rest to enhance overall fitness and recovery processes.- Warm up properly before workouts to improve performance and prevent injuries.- Track nutritional intake to maintain awareness of caloric and macronutrient consumption.- Use minimal equipment at home to create effective workout routines.- Avoid comparing yourself to others in fitness settings to maintain a positive mindset.- Take regular breaks from intense dieting to maintain motivation and prevent burnout.- Focus on the quality of movements during weight training for better muscle activation.### FACTS:- Muscle growth primarily occurs when the body is in a state of rest and recovery.- The average person burns approximately 100 to 150 calories while running a mile.- Effective muscle training can be achieved with only a couple of hours per week.- Inactivity leads to muscle loss, starting around two weeks after the last workout.- Muscle memory significantly aids in regaining strength after periods of inactivity.- The majority of people find calorie counting unsustainable for long-term weight management.- Proper nutrition is critical in supporting muscle growth and overall fitness goals.- Resistance training can be effectively done at home with minimal equipment.- Emotional and psychological factors play a significant role in fitness adherence.- Muscle dysmorphia is prevalent among men, leading to distorted self-perceptions of fitness.### REFERENCES:- Dr. Michael Israetel's YouTube channel, which has over 7 million subscribers.- Discussion on various fitness myths and strategies for effective muscle building.- Mention of scientific studies related to muscle memory and retraining effects.- Insights on the role of nutrition and exercise in achieving fitness goals.- Reference to training techniques and methodologies for muscle hypertrophy.### ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAYEffective muscle building requires consistency, proper nutrition, and understanding the science behind fitness routines.### RECOMMENDATIONS:- Focus on consistent training rather than excessive workout hours for effective results.- Tailor workout plans to individual goals for optimal muscle growth and efficiency.- Incorporate a variety of exercises targeting specific muscle groups for balanced development.- Emphasize the importance of recovery and nutrition in achieving fitness goals.- Use minimal equipment effectively at home to maintain a consistent workout routine.- Regularly reassess fitness goals to maintain motivation and progress.- Aim for two to three strength training sessions per week for optimal results.- Avoid rigid dietary restrictions;

my00:00:23.039 mission is to get everyone in as good of00:00:26.039 shape as possible with minimum time00:00:28.439 investment so where do we start so it's00:00:30.800 the consistency that matters

Dr00:02:28.440 Michael what is the mission that you00:02:31.280 find yourself on in this phase of your00:02:34.319 life for those who would00:02:36.760 like to get everyone who would like in00:02:40.680 as good of shape as possible with as00:02:44.720 minimum of a Time investment injury00:02:48.239 probability and inconvenience in in00:02:52.239 general as possible and the highest00:02:54.000 likelihood of best results while trying00:02:56.480 to completely excise doing anything that00:02:59.440 is pointless and also I say this00:03:03.200 politely telling people things that00:03:06.280 aren't true we're trying to get as many00:03:08.680 people fit leaner more muscular more00:03:11.280 flexible healthier Etc as humanly00:03:14.560 possible to the extent that they are00:03:16.640 interested in that sort of thing because00:03:17.840 not everyone's into fitness and I00:03:19.159 understand that I mean I think I look00:03:20.799 kind of you know freaky and it scares00:03:22.519 certain people so I have a lot of time00:03:24.080 for that but if you want to get fit uh00:03:26.319 we're trying our best what are the the00:03:29.080 big myths that end up standing in the00:03:30.840 way of most people when they when they00:03:32.760 hear this conversation now what are the00:03:36.120 most frequent rebuttal that you'll get00:03:38.439 when you say that someone can get in00:03:39.879 shape and be be lean with limited time00:03:44.040 two super common ones00:03:46.360 are I don't have the time to work out00:03:50.319 and into that time to work out is00:03:52.599 included I don't have regular gym access00:03:55.040 or I technically do but I'd have to00:03:57.200 drive to the gym I just don't have the00:03:58.840 time of the bandwidth where I don't have00:04:00.280 the scheduling positioning in in my life00:04:02.400 to do this sort of thing and baked into00:04:05.519 that is the assumption that getting much00:04:08.000 healthier and much leaner and much more00:04:09.720 muscular takes like an inordinate amount00:04:11.720 of time one of the most common questions00:04:13.519 I get out in the real world when people00:04:15.599 happen to look in my general direction00:04:17.079 because usually people just kind of go00:04:18.358 like what the hell is wrong that guy's00:04:19.639 head but uh one of the most common00:04:22.120 questions I get is how many uh hours a00:04:25.120 day do you work out or how many days a00:04:26.800 week do you work out and every single00:04:28.560 person is expecting an answer that is00:04:31.160 kind of like asking the tallest00:04:33.080 basketball player you've ever met how00:04:34.520 tall they are you want an answer that's00:04:36.080 like 2 and a half meters you want00:04:38.080 something meaty and if they tell you00:04:39.600 like well I'm a meter 90 you're kind of00:04:41.479 like is that that cool and every time I00:04:44.120 tell them how much I work out which is00:04:45.680 really like it at my real like trying to00:04:49.160 be as good as bodybuilding as possible00:04:51.039 is really eight hours a week and this is00:04:53.919 to do this insane thing for people just00:04:57.400 trying to be fit and healthy Etc where00:04:59.880 talking about a sum total of 1 hour per00:05:02.800 week split into two or three 20ish00:05:06.280 minute sessions something we'll be00:05:07.520 trying later on is such a huge stimulus00:05:12.280 and can radically transform your body00:05:14.360 especially if you have attention to00:05:15.960 nutrition and that's the second thing00:05:17.800 that's a big Dogma big myth is people00:05:20.800 have ideas about what comes into00:05:24.720 nutrition and nutrition for being more00:05:27.639 lean more muscular and healthier they00:05:30.000 have all these kind of a constellation00:05:31.759 of ideas um uh Economist and philosopher00:05:34.840 Thomas soell calls them Notions so if00:05:36.759 you have a hierarchy of understanding00:05:38.919 you have Theory at the top which is like00:05:41.160 gravitation Evolution things super super00:05:43.199 confirmed just beneath that you have00:05:44.880 model like uh the standard model in00:05:46.840 physics is not quite good enough quite00:05:48.560 good enough support be a theory but it's00:05:50.120 very well understood space with a few00:05:51.680 Mysteries under that you have a00:05:53.880 hypothesis which is you know you have a00:05:56.160 real good idea formally phrased and00:05:58.479 underneath that you have a notion and an00:06:00.240 oce's just things people say and people00:06:02.400 are like uhhuh and no one even asks or00:06:04.800 answers about is this really true and so00:06:06.960 when you talk to people about nutrition00:06:08.240 or they talk to you about why they're00:06:10.160 not in such great shape another thing I00:06:12.000 get is when you're pretty jacked and00:06:13.560 lean and you sit next to someone on a00:06:15.000 plane they treat you almost like a00:06:16.759 religious figure like a priest or an00:06:18.120 imom and they're like apologize they're00:06:20.400 like Co you look like you're in good00:06:21.759 shape I just haven't been to the gym and00:06:23.000 I'm like I love you as a human being no00:06:25.039 matter all the time really all the time00:06:27.039 they apologize for the state they're in00:06:28.479 more or less yeah or they see me eat a00:06:29.960 protein bar and they're getting like the00:06:31.160 food on the plane and they're like this00:06:32.639 is bad for me huh and I'm like no it's00:06:34.080 actually quite fine and I always a00:06:35.319 little bit confused so all these ideas00:06:38.280 people have about nutrition organic00:06:41.280 artificial sweeteners are bad00:06:43.720 glutenfree GMOs um you have to have very00:06:47.520 meticulously well-prepared meals there00:06:49.840 is a ton of food that's huge laundr list00:06:52.240 of food that's unhealthy and bad for you00:06:53.800 makes you fat there are other foods that00:06:55.560 are a little bit more nuanced and00:06:56.840 difficult to find that are super Health00:06:58.120 Foods and'll radically transform you I00:06:59.879 can go on for hours about these myths00:07:01.759 but people come in with these myths as00:07:03.840 Notions as things they believe that00:07:05.479 they're like this is how it is right and00:07:07.400 when you tell them like actually that's00:07:09.000 not true a lot of them are00:07:11.240 like no way because maybe that's the00:07:13.639 first time they've heard about it so you00:07:14.960 tell people working out doesn't have to00:07:17.440 last forever if you do it intelligently00:07:19.840 which is what we specialize at RP about00:07:21.400 teaching people how to do and00:07:22.440 demonstrating digital00:07:24.000 products you can get into really really00:07:26.199 good shape with not so much time00:07:27.960 investment and it's not so difficult00:07:29.800 it's difficult in the moment as far as00:07:31.080 you got to try hard but you know an hour00:07:33.400 of trying hard a week is not the end of00:07:34.879 the world and then a nutritional front00:07:36.759 they come in and they think it takes all00:07:39.039 these crazy special things like people00:07:41.560 will watch me eat regular food and00:07:43.160 they'll be like you eat that I'm like00:07:45.400 yes like but I thought that you know but00:07:48.039 you need the super special food I like00:07:49.639 that's never been true but um people00:07:53.199 come in with their stack of ideas and00:07:57.319 these there's just dozens and dozens and00:07:59.520 myths on both ends we'll go through all00:08:01.400 of those myths but but my last question00:08:04.080 before we get into it is why does it00:08:06.520 matter to be in good shape and this is I00:08:09.639 I'm asking you here to really draw on00:08:11.280 some of the case studies that you've00:08:13.039 probably been exposed to where people00:08:15.000 have turned their lives around what is00:08:16.879 the net benefit of someone who's00:08:18.159 listening right now who's maybe heard00:08:19.479 about Fitness stuff before and has heard00:08:21.560 from personal trainers and bodybuilders00:08:23.400 and whoever else but for whatever reason00:08:25.199 they just haven't been able to get up00:08:26.680 off the sofa and get into action it's00:08:28.400 difficult you know what is why should00:08:30.520 they why should they C I love that00:08:32.519 question the first thing I'll say is um00:08:37.240 is maybe not a surprise to many of the00:08:39.240 people that know me politically I'm like00:08:41.799 super pro freedom freedom of all kinds00:08:44.279 inclusion and that means to me also that00:08:47.279 if someone doesn't want to pursue00:08:48.880 Fitness as a human being you have the00:08:51.160 same love and respect at least for me00:08:53.120 that anyone who's fit would have and so00:08:55.800 as far as like it'll just make you a00:08:57.640 better person and you you got to get fit00:08:59.640 people will see uh people that are obese00:09:02.120 and they're like look lazy and uh how do00:09:04.120 they live with themselves I don't ever00:09:06.160 think things like that not because I'm a00:09:08.079 good person I'm not a good person at all00:09:09.959 but what Fitness won't give you is it00:09:12.760 won't elevate your status as a better00:09:15.160 person in some way however the other00:09:19.839 benefits of Fitness we could have a00:09:22.720 10-hour podcast where I just go through00:09:24.640 them one one at a time and we would00:09:26.120 never get through all of them I'll give00:09:27.320 you a couple of samplings of kind of the00:09:28.680 big hitters00:09:30.600 one is Health straight up so if you00:09:34.320 reduce your body fat substantially and00:09:36.160 you increase your muscularity00:09:37.360 substantially and you adopt a lifestyle00:09:39.600 of moderate to moderately High physical00:09:43.000 activity quite00:09:45.120 regularly this is about as close in real00:09:47.240 life as we have so far to a Panacea a00:09:49.120 cure all it isn't cure all but the00:09:51.760 degree of00:09:54.000 preventative uh you won't get really00:09:56.240 sick very soon effect that has is just00:10:00.440 radical I uh just coming off of them but00:10:04.360 if it's okay to say it was recently on00:10:06.279 like a boatload of steroids like the00:10:08.920 worst ones got blood work right in the00:10:11.760 middle of that because I was very lean00:10:14.200 and very physically active and muscular00:10:16.120 my blood Works Stellar just being leaner00:10:18.880 and more muscular and more active just00:10:21.240 cleans your blood work up like00:10:23.560 crazyy and makes your longterm it00:10:27.040 increases your longevity considerably00:10:29.320 but it does something I think is pretty00:10:30.920 close to equally important it00:10:33.200 increases the kind of time you're having00:10:35.480 in your life while you're alive uh it00:10:38.680 makes it way better it reduces the00:10:40.680 morbidity and so because you can be00:10:42.600 around a long time living in an assisted00:10:44.720 care facility and like on machines to00:10:46.800 keep you that's you're alive sure but00:10:49.120 there something missing there but if you00:10:51.079 have more muscle less fat and more00:10:53.079 physical activity you ever see like an00:10:55.079 80-year-old that's like cardio walking00:10:56.680 down the street and you're like my man00:10:58.880 it'll you that so that's a big deal so00:11:01.440 Health it'll give you usually people00:11:04.279 experience a perception of Wellness00:11:06.160 that's psychological they just feel00:11:08.760 better they feel cleaner they feel more00:11:11.880 energy the cognitive benefits of health00:11:14.399 and fitness are now being addressed00:11:16.000 seriously in the literature and they00:11:17.240 have been for a little while but it's00:11:18.360 kind of00:11:19.519 swelling uh is unequivocally true now to00:11:22.360 say that regularly engaging in Fitness00:11:24.959 makes you literally smarter just00:11:27.480 straight up and it conserves your00:11:31.000 brain's cognitive health for decades00:11:34.600 into the future as you do it00:11:36.279 consistently it's just win all the way00:11:38.480 across what is your background in terms00:11:42.519 of your academic qualifications and00:11:45.279 experiences that you've had that feed00:11:47.360 into everything that you know this is00:11:49.360 sounds so pretentious I can't believe00:11:50.880 I'm using this nomenclature but I did my00:11:53.120 undergraduate work at the University of00:11:56.040 Michigan where I met uh my fellow00:11:58.800 co-founder of RP Nick Shaw and um that00:12:03.040 was in kinesiology uh specifically a00:12:05.639 subset of something called movement00:12:07.079 science I then went on to do a master's00:12:10.279 in technically strength and conditioning00:12:12.120 but exercise science at appalachin State00:12:14.560 University then I went for one year to00:12:17.079 go work in New York City with Nick as a00:12:19.160 personal trainer at the end of that00:12:21.519 process I realized that for my own00:12:23.600 personal like Vibe I just didn't know00:12:25.680 enough and I wanted to know more and so00:12:28.880 I got accepted to a PhD program at East00:12:30.800 Tennessee State University under the00:12:32.160 great Mike Stone who is probably one of00:12:34.880 the most well-published sports00:12:35.959 scientists of all time maybe definitely00:12:38.399 the conversation for the greatest00:12:39.519 American Sports scientist of all time00:12:42.079 and I went to that PhD program and that00:12:44.760 was in sport physiology and the best way00:12:46.600 we had of summarizing what it is we were00:12:48.399 learning is the thing we're learning00:12:50.240 best here is how to take good athletes00:12:52.040 and make them better and so I did three00:12:54.240 years of that it sounds like a it's like00:12:55.639 a prison time I did three years in00:12:57.600 ETSU and uh that was the conclusion I00:13:01.279 was a terminal degree I got a PhD in00:13:02.839 sport physiology and then I spent oh gez00:13:05.720 10 years in various uh professorships uh00:13:08.720 teaching and doing some research and all00:13:10.959 this other stuff I'm no longer a college00:13:13.040 professor mostly because like there's00:13:15.760 only so many things you can do at the00:13:17.240 same time well and it was kind of like00:13:19.440 this is this YouTube thing is getting00:13:20.880 kind of insane so time to Pivot to that00:13:23.320 but uh I'm still actively involved in00:13:25.360 research our company funds research I00:13:26.959 still look at manuscripts I still00:13:28.199 co-author so I'm still involved in that00:13:29.800 capacity as well so I want to start with00:13:31.519 a start if someone's listening to this00:13:33.720 right now and they have walked into your00:13:36.440 this is your uh this is your practice00:13:38.839 this is your hypertrophy practice let's00:13:40.440 say this table and they sit there and00:13:42.720 they say I would like to gain more lean00:13:45.800 muscle mass and I'd like to lose some00:13:48.519 weight um I live A busy life where do we00:13:52.120 start what step one and you know like00:13:54.839 I'm actually going to Hazard a guess at00:13:56.040 step one to see if I'm correct but for00:13:58.480 me step one is quite psychological00:14:00.920 because it's all well and good me having00:14:02.199 the tactics and strategies and the00:14:03.800 information but if I don't have the00:14:05.639 motivation none of it's going to matter00:14:08.079 anyway so is step one psychological in00:14:11.560 some way absolutely my God you should00:14:14.079 just be taking my job with this point no00:14:15.519 but okay I thought so I thought that was00:14:17.160 so what what would you do for me to get00:14:19.079 me in the right psychological00:14:21.480 mindset I would even take a step back00:14:23.600 before that okay the first thing we do00:14:26.920 is called the needs analysis and formal00:14:29.399 Sport Science a needs analysis is what00:14:33.519 do you00:14:34.600 want specifically do you want bigger00:14:37.720 arms how much muscle are you trying to00:14:40.079 gain it's a very different conversation00:14:41.560 of someone weighs 150 pounds and they're00:14:44.040 like I want to be 155 but leaner versus00:14:47.040 I weigh 150 pounds and I want to be 20000:14:49.920 ripped different timelines different00:14:52.000 approaches different trade-offs okay00:14:53.440 give me the00:14:54.399 typical answer to that question most00:14:57.360 people just open-ended to be completely00:14:58.839 honest honest you're like I just want to00:15:00.279 get much leaner and some of them will00:15:02.320 say I also want to put on a lot of00:15:03.720 muscle the muscle thing is a lot of00:15:06.040 times with females they just want the00:15:07.519 leaner part but they understand in many00:15:10.000 cases that if they just jettison their00:15:12.600 muscle entirely they end up looking more00:15:14.399 sick than healthy uh but a lot of the00:15:16.800 males leaner is important but also00:15:18.920 getting super jacked is important but00:15:20.920 how jacked and how lean that's the00:15:23.120 conversation is if they come in with00:15:24.880 totally open-ended concerns it's kind of00:15:26.399 like walking into a car dealership and00:15:27.600 being like I want a car like you going00:15:28.720 to have to be a little I we'll sell you00:15:30.120 whatever you're going to have to tell me00:15:31.680 a little bit more about what your use00:15:32.959 cases are about what your budget is so00:15:35.240 that's another big thing in a need00:15:36.399 analysis is how much time can you give00:15:40.000 to this because if someone says I want00:15:43.040 to eventually be a professional00:15:45.120 bodybuilder and I've got nothing but00:15:47.480 time in my week to do the thing think00:15:49.880 getting a very different plan than00:15:51.199 someone that's like I just want to be00:15:53.839 able to see my man down there again and00:15:57.959 like just not die soon and I have two00:16:02.120 hours a week to give you very different00:16:04.880 plan so I've got let's say I've got a00:16:07.319 couple of hours a week so you know two00:16:09.319 three hours a week that I could probably00:16:11.519 spare maybe four and I just want to get00:16:14.040 a bit leaner and I want to gain some00:16:15.360 muscle yeah I also ask what have you00:16:19.240 been doing so far tell me about your00:16:21.680 approach to Fitness and the answer could00:16:23.160 be I don't have one I've never tried to00:16:25.680 do anything once we get a lot of that00:16:27.920 information I don't want to say the plan00:16:29.839 writes itself but sort of almost now we00:16:33.120 really really really have all the00:16:35.560 details to fill in the blanks and then00:16:38.279 from there once you've done that sort of00:16:39.360 needs analysis and you've understood the00:16:40.759 investment that they're willing to make00:16:42.199 you understand what their goals are you00:16:44.240 understand their current approach to00:16:45.440 Fitness what becomes step two so if00:16:48.680 again I'm trying to embody the viewer00:16:50.000 here who's trying to change their life00:16:51.600 yeah yeah get going for step two often00:16:53.600 times uh just to keep it SCH we can I we00:16:56.079 definitely do nutrition uh if you'd like00:16:57.800 so please C me in for that but I'll just00:16:59.360 use um training as a quick example here00:17:02.480 uh a big one is do you go to a gym can00:17:07.400 you make it to a gym or are you going to00:17:09.160 be training at home because training at00:17:11.880 home is a bit of a different world you00:17:13.559 can get amazing results at home but we00:17:15.599 need to make sure you have the right00:17:16.760 equipment and it's super minimal two 2000:17:19.839 lb dumbbells I like that you're looking00:17:21.760 over at the dumbbells like are those 2000:17:23.919 kg dumbbells they're 20 pound dumbbells00:17:26.280 is that what I need at home for many00:17:28.240 people 20 like adult males white spry00:17:31.039 like yourself 20 pound dumbbells at home00:17:33.440 will give you phenomenal overall result00:17:37.039 yeah what is that nine kgs or something00:17:40.120 oh here we go your assistance are quite00:17:42.919 strong by the way thank do you fight00:17:44.760 crime in your spare00:17:47.480 time okay so these are 20 pound00:17:50.840 dumbbells You're just showing off now00:17:52.840 but but these are what I need at home to00:17:54.799 to do a workout uh yeah somewhere00:17:56.799 between 10 and 20 pounds 10 for small00:17:58.840 smaller lighter females 20 for larger00:18:01.799 more strong males somewhere between that00:18:04.480 two of those dumbbells at home and a00:18:06.799 little bit of floor space can be the00:18:08.480 beginning of an absolutely revolutionary00:18:10.400 workout program really yeah oh yeah how00:18:13.960 so give me the starting position and the00:18:16.960 end position that I could get to just00:18:19.559 with these dumbbells at home if you00:18:22.600 properly control your diet and you00:18:24.880 haven't really lifted weights before and00:18:27.039 you're let's say 30 40 50 years old in a00:18:30.440 6month time span we can reliably get you00:18:34.000 to gain 5 to 10 lounds of muscle which00:18:37.400 if you go to the store what is that like00:18:39.600 five let's say the two to five kilos of00:18:42.559 muscle you ever buy two to five kilos of00:18:44.880 meat at the store that's a lot of meat00:18:47.240 that's going on your body and we can00:18:49.720 reliably get you to lose oh gee five to00:18:54.799 7 and 1 12 kilos of fat in a six-month00:18:57.400 time frame just by being intelligent00:18:59.720 about your diet and doing two workouts00:19:03.120 per week at home with your dumbbells and00:19:05.840 the workouts each take roughly 2000:19:08.760 minutes so that's 40 minutes a week oh00:19:12.440 yeah now that's if you're unaccustomed00:19:14.039 and unadjusted if you have already and00:19:16.159 that's why those intake questions are00:19:17.400 important because if you're like look I00:19:18.720 go to the gym six times a week I spend00:19:20.120 two hours at the gym like them dumbbells00:19:22.320 can keep you in pretty good shape but00:19:24.480 they're not going to elevate your shape00:19:25.679 very likely at very least it'll be00:19:27.640 highly inefficient and incredibly00:19:29.200 discomforting for what you'd have to do00:19:30.679 with such00:19:31.760 dumbbells so what is step three then so00:19:34.080 if we've got the equipment part figured00:19:35.640 out and I guess the complicated element00:19:37.520 of that is some people have anxiety as00:19:40.240 it relates to going to the gym I've got00:19:41.480 a lot of friends that because they're so00:19:44.039 inexperienced with weightlifting or the00:19:45.799 machines they feel embarrassed to go to00:19:48.240 the gym so that well at least that's00:19:50.720 what they tell me now I don't know00:19:51.880 whether they're Beering themselves but00:19:53.679 they tell me that they have gym anxiety00:19:56.000 you know you walk and I no actually I00:19:57.320 can relate you walk into a gym00:19:58.679 especially if I go to like a uh like a00:20:00.320 bodybuilding gym and I do look around I00:20:02.480 go okay everyone here knows what they're00:20:03.640 doing more than I do o that's already00:20:05.720 wrong but we'll get to that a bit and00:20:07.240 are they looking at me are they do they00:20:08.919 know that I I don't know how this00:20:10.280 machine works and if I don't know how a00:20:11.919 machine works and there's nothing you00:20:13.720 know No Label to tell me sometimes I00:20:15.360 just avoid the machine if I'm in in like00:20:16.919 a bodybuilding gym because I [ __ ]00:20:18.600 hell I don't know how to do my wrist00:20:20.880 muscles yeah I just look like a doofus00:20:23.480 and everyone's making fun of me in their00:20:24.720 head what I think sometimes if I go to00:20:26.080 like a really Elite Gym so yeah so first00:20:28.880 of all I think people's gym anxiety is00:20:30.799 absolutely real thing I can speak to00:20:32.240 that at at length The Next Step would be00:20:35.799 to say Hey listen based on all the00:20:38.559 information we've collected on your00:20:39.880 limitations desires abilities we've00:20:43.120 cultivated a plan for you be diet plan00:20:45.559 and just just stick into the muscle00:20:47.080 growth00:20:48.200 stuff here's your plan for your00:20:52.760 training and we actually have an app for00:20:55.640 this sort of thing where we would say00:20:57.840 okay here's how you you type in all your00:20:59.320 stuff in the app the app will create a00:21:01.120 plan for you and it'll tell you here's00:21:03.919 what to do for warming up here's you00:21:05.960 know you pick a weight it tells you how00:21:07.159 to pick your weights and then it00:21:08.440 programs the rest of your two months of00:21:10.880 training for you you fill in the how do00:21:12.799 we how do I feel how am I recovering00:21:14.279 it'll take care of everything else and00:21:16.720 if you ever get confused you click on00:21:18.600 the exercise and it opens up a video00:21:20.840 with an audio demonstration of how to do00:21:23.880 it and of someone a professional00:21:25.960 bodybuilder doing the thing you go oh00:21:28.120 that's that's what bicep curls was okay00:21:29.880 got it so now you have all the answers00:21:31.880 and you don't have to have our app we00:21:34.039 think it's nice you don't have to have00:21:35.320 it just whatever kind of plan you have00:21:38.200 that's your little map of the Caribbean00:21:40.080 Sea with the AIS and the pirate ships00:21:42.240 and you know exactly where to go and00:21:44.240 it's you your app or your map of how to00:21:47.320 train your program and everyone else00:21:50.440 like in The Avengers movie it's just00:21:53.279 just floats away there's no one else00:21:54.960 there's not even any other machines it's00:21:56.559 you and the bicep curl machine00:21:59.159 and the hypertrophy app says first set00:22:01.440 is 12 reps at 50 pounds I take the00:22:03.360 select Dr stack I go to 50 and I'm nice00:22:05.559 and warmed up and I do 12 reps and00:22:07.799 that's as far as you have to think about00:22:09.120 it comparisons whatever everyone else00:22:10.679 thinks without a plan oh boy are you00:22:13.120 second guessing yourself with a plan you00:22:15.320 don't have to second guess anything most00:22:16.520 those people don't have a plan they're00:22:17.440 just in there on Vibes I feel like my00:22:19.000 delts are going to grow today if I do00:22:20.320 this like thanks thanks for that00:22:22.039 intellectual opinion you said there's00:22:24.000 two types of effective training one of00:22:27.039 them's H H can't say this but one of00:22:29.240 them is hypertrophy very good and the00:22:31.600 other one is00:22:33.760 periodization uh so periodization is the00:22:37.480 scientifically based organization of any00:22:39.880 kind of training that you want okay00:22:41.919 hypertrophy training is a type of00:22:43.679 training it's just muscle growth00:22:44.880 training it's like a fancy [ __ ]00:22:46.880 science word for just getting more00:22:49.440 jacked putting on muscle that's the00:22:51.919 technical definition of hypertrophy and00:22:54.360 when you train for hypertrophy you can00:22:56.080 do it kind of like by feel and more or00:22:57.880 less at random and you'll get pretty00:22:59.120 good results in most cases but to get00:23:00.960 your best results you want that training00:23:02.320 to be periodized periodization is the00:23:05.760 scientific approach to how to organize00:23:07.559 your training to get sort of roughly00:23:09.640 three things some of these are a bit00:23:11.240 more for athletes and not regular people00:23:13.919 get the best results that you can Peak00:23:16.679 at an appropriate time abs for summer00:23:19.520 and minimize injury risk and taking all00:23:22.400 the science that we know that plan that00:23:24.559 you've made because you did in an00:23:26.559 evidence-based fashion that is now what00:23:28.760 is considered a periodized plan so00:23:31.039 that's how those two concepts relate to00:23:32.960 each other what do I need to know about00:23:35.000 hypertrophy in order to be able to00:23:36.960 achieve it is there anything really00:23:38.440 foundational because I think everyone00:23:40.840 wants a bit of muscle growth and I spend00:23:42.880 I think I spend too long in the gym I00:23:44.159 think I could be much more efficient um00:23:46.360 when I'm training what would you00:23:48.480 recommend that I start thinking about as00:23:50.720 F foundational principles when it comes00:23:52.799 to hypertrophy muscle growth one is00:23:56.320 specificity it's the most important00:23:58.440 principle in all of sport painting and00:24:00.440 exercise science is uh what am I here00:24:03.919 for what do I want because you can do a00:24:06.919 bunch of exercises in the gym and you're00:24:09.159 like that was great and someone's like00:24:10.720 are you getting the results you like00:24:11.679 you're like well I what I want is a00:24:13.120 bigger bicep like how many bicep00:24:14.720 exercises do you do like I think upright00:24:16.720 rows maybe so I want a bigger bicep00:24:18.840 bicep if we just focus on me give00:24:20.440 getting Steven B a bigger left bicep so00:24:24.760 specificity is telling yourself okay I00:24:26.279 want bigger biceps and whatever XYZ00:24:28.399 other00:24:29.200 muscles then we move in to the principle00:24:32.399 of overload which means you have to00:24:35.120 challenge00:24:36.440 yourself if most of your00:24:39.559 sets someone else watching them can't00:24:42.080 tell if you're warming up or doing00:24:43.600 what's called a working set like a real00:24:45.159 set you have a problem so towards the00:24:48.039 end of all of your sets either the00:24:50.360 weights are slowing down or even if it's00:24:53.720 the same speed to you they feel00:24:55.480 perceptively harder you know you do this00:24:57.960 this this and in a couple reps you're00:25:00.720 like that's what you want every real00:25:03.600 working set should be challenging you00:25:05.720 should be work approaching every real00:25:07.320 set with just a teeny teeny dose of00:25:09.600 trepidation like oh boy here we go I'm00:25:13.000 GNA have to00:25:14.279 try once you have that and a set is a a00:25:18.080 group of repetitions correct so if I do00:25:20.720 10 repetitions that's one set one set00:25:22.799 yeah and so your sets have to be00:25:25.399 sufficiently heavy uh anything between00:25:28.320 between roughly five reps per set and 3000:25:31.200 reps per set where the last few reps are00:25:33.440 getting close to you not being able to00:25:34.919 use good technique and lift the weights00:25:37.279 check plus so there's not a set a00:25:39.640 perfect amount of repetitions to do00:25:41.840 there is it's a trade secret and I'd00:25:43.279 have to say it off camera to you like ND00:25:45.600 assign okay we're off camera all right00:25:47.080 great so it's00:25:48.480 17 um there is so there's just tons of00:25:51.880 tons of contextual Nuance kind of stuff00:25:54.720 some people some of their muscles will00:25:56.600 seem respond better to sets a five to 1000:25:59.279 other folks even the same person could00:26:01.159 have muscles in their body that really00:26:02.360 respond better to sets of 20 to 30 and00:26:04.840 everything in between but generally you00:26:06.039 get in in the exercise science data00:26:09.039 you'll have a group of people training00:26:10.919 for sets of roughly five reps and00:26:13.360 another group training for sets of00:26:14.760 roughly 30 reps and their change in00:26:17.039 muscle growth over 8 12 16 weeks is00:26:19.480 statistically undifferenced00:26:28.600 that's so crazy using the same weight00:26:30.760 I'm guessing different weight a weight00:26:32.840 that is challenging for five reps is00:26:34.279 much heavier than a weight that is00:26:35.320 challenging for 30 okay so I do Wonder00:26:37.200 this all the time when I go to the gym I00:26:38.279 wonder if I should be doing I don't know00:26:40.320 30 reps of 10 kg on my bicep or I should00:26:42.960 be doing 10 reps of 20 kg they're both00:26:46.360 right answers no wrong answers there and00:26:48.120 they both have the same chance of00:26:50.559 growing my muscles as long as the strain00:26:53.120 that I experience subjectively is00:26:55.799 difficult at the end of those set00:26:57.080 correct okay interesting which is really00:26:59.120 good news because that's like another00:27:00.360 thing you don't have to worry about00:27:01.760 which means at home I can get any range00:27:03.159 of Weights versus having to get really00:27:05.559 really big ones to gr as long as they're00:27:07.039 not so tiny that you're on rep number 4500:27:09.120 and you're like I could just do this for00:27:10.240 forever or they're not so enormous that00:27:12.240 you're like I can't really even do two00:27:13.679 reps of this anything between roughly00:27:15.399 five and roughly 30 reps challenging is00:27:18.159 really really good how many sets and how00:27:21.240 often do I have to visit the gym to get00:27:24.279 this bicep to grow that answer depends00:27:26.640 on how much you've been doing before00:27:28.640 okay but if you're new to the gym two00:27:31.559 sessions a week with two to three sets00:27:35.440 per session for your biceps is something00:27:38.640 that's going to cause months and months00:27:40.200 and months of consistent progress can00:27:42.559 you do more yes do you have to do as a00:27:45.760 beginner no eventually as a more00:27:48.000 advanced person do you need to do more00:27:50.039 sets and perhaps more sessions to get00:27:51.679 consistently better results yes but for00:27:53.919 beginners who haven't been in the gym00:27:55.200 very much or at all the minimal00:27:57.320 effective dose is profoundly small which00:28:00.640 is why I can say things like if you work00:28:02.039 out for 20 minutes twice a week you're00:28:03.360 going to get great gains what if I go to00:28:05.480 the gym and I do six sets on my biceps00:28:09.120 and I just go to the gym once a week00:28:10.960 does the distance between the workouts00:28:13.519 in a muscle group have an impact yes00:28:16.919 once a week training gives you good00:28:18.880 results but twice a week training for00:28:21.240 the same muscle gives you notably better00:28:24.799 results training three times a week00:28:27.559 versus twice tce training four times a00:28:29.840 week versus three times training five00:28:31.799 times a week versus four times is uh an00:28:35.279 an exponentially de-escalating amount of00:28:37.919 impressive differences so one time a00:28:40.320 week Works it'll get you results two00:28:43.320 times a week gets you like one and a00:28:45.120 half times the results like way better00:28:47.919 better three times a week is like00:28:50.399 another little bit more results still00:28:52.320 notable four times a week is like you00:28:54.519 got to be training for a while to notice00:28:56.120 the difference between three and four00:28:58.080 four and five is contextual and nuanced00:29:00.000 and I can't actually tell you that00:29:01.320 categorically 5 days a week is better00:29:03.080 than four there are some things I would00:29:04.720 have to know about your plan and00:29:05.799 everything else to make that conclusion00:29:07.159 so really I want to be aiming at twice a00:29:08.559 week per muscle group twice is our00:29:10.279 minimum two to four times a week is what00:29:11.880 I say is kind of the best overall00:29:13.480 recommendation per muscle group and if00:29:15.799 you train all of your muscles together00:29:17.519 at the same time a whole body workout00:29:19.039 which most people in the realm of just00:29:20.880 I'm busy and I can't train a lot it00:29:22.640 would be all of the major muscles of00:29:24.519 your body in the same session twice or00:29:28.440 three times or four times a week and00:29:30.039 that is an awesome beginner fitness plan00:29:32.840 what's going on in my muscles that's00:29:35.519 encouraging them and making them grow00:29:37.480 and when are they growing is it when I00:29:38.720 go to bed at night is it when I do they00:29:40.559 grow the minute that I curl the the00:29:42.799 dumbbell what's actually going on00:29:44.640 because sometimes understanding what's00:29:45.960 actually going on inside helps me to00:29:47.519 think through and change my behavior00:29:50.000 yeah so uh the primary stimulus for00:29:53.600 muscle growth is there are molecular00:29:56.320 machines in your muscles in your muscle00:29:58.919 cells and they are designed to detect00:30:01.960 the presence of00:30:04.360 tension and when your muscles generate00:30:06.559 tension the molecular detector machines00:30:08.559 go o we got tension here and they start00:30:11.320 uh saying to other parts of the cells00:30:13.039 like hey uh let's get this muscle growth00:30:14.679 thing started started not happening00:30:16.679 started it's a stimulus of muscle growth00:30:19.080 there are a couple of other mechanisms00:30:20.600 which might SL probably have an effect00:30:24.840 and that a couple of them are metabolite00:30:26.960 sequestration which is a very fancy way00:30:28.880 of saying the burn you know at the end00:30:30.559 of a set you're like ah the metabolites00:30:33.799 the um byproducts of training if they00:30:36.480 accumulate to high levels it's been00:30:37.880 shown in tons of animal studies and a00:30:40.000 few human studies that like00:30:41.640 mechanistically they might also tell the00:30:43.399 molecular Machinery that grows muscle00:30:45.000 for you again later to uh hey get the00:30:48.240 muscle growth process another one is the00:30:49.760 pump so you know you do a couple sets of00:30:51.399 biceps you're oh my God what's going on00:30:53.320 here baby flash it at some girl she runs00:30:55.399 away as usual and the actual cell00:30:58.440 swelling itself might play a causal00:31:01.399 mechanistic role in generating more00:31:03.159 muscle growth but but we know it's00:31:04.960 probably at least at Le least 80% of the00:31:07.720 muscle growth anyone will see is because00:31:09.840 of those receptors for tension muscle00:31:13.320 growth as soon as you leave the gym is a00:31:16.200 negative because the gym is catabolic00:31:18.440 it's a breaks down your muscle actually00:31:21.120 training breaks down more muscle than it00:31:23.559 builds however as you go home and you00:31:26.919 start eating food protein carbs fats and00:31:30.039 you have several meals per day and00:31:32.399 you're resting when the food's coming in00:31:35.120 several hours after training begins if00:31:37.360 you measure muscle growth consistently00:31:39.000 which is really difficult to do they00:31:40.320 don't do it super often you have to keep00:31:41.960 people in a laboratory you have to do00:31:43.240 radioactive tracers and measure all this00:31:45.200 weird00:31:46.200 stuff every couple of hours they measure00:31:48.720 the amount of muscle growth that's going00:31:50.399 on in the biceps goes up and up and up00:31:52.200 and up and it usually Peaks00:31:53.840 about half a day to a day and a half00:31:56.880 after you lift depend depending on how00:31:58.360 hard you went if it's a pretty easy00:31:59.679 workout it Peaks a little sooner and00:32:02.440 Dives and drops off about a day or two00:32:04.480 later if you train really crazy hard00:32:07.159 it'll Peak like a day day and a half00:32:08.679 later and then half a week later it'll00:32:10.399 drop off back to Baseline levels but00:32:12.559 it's this really smooth curve and you're00:32:15.880 growing muscle at every single point00:32:17.559 under that curve So when you say is it00:32:19.600 while I'm sleeping is it while I'm00:32:20.679 eating is it while I'm resting the aners00:32:22.320 all of those except it's not at the gym00:32:25.200 you don't grow muscle at the gym you00:32:26.919 give yourself a signal to grow muscle at00:32:28.480 the gym and then what you do outside of00:32:30.039 the gym matters so some people train00:32:31.320 really hard they don't eat right they00:32:33.159 don't need enough protein their sleep is00:32:35.080 total insert bad word here and their00:32:37.799 stress levels are just totally psychotic00:32:40.320 they train hard and then week after week00:32:42.440 after week they're like not seeing any00:32:44.720 results well the results are actually00:32:46.440 created when you're resting when you're00:32:48.480 sleeping when you're eating nutritious00:32:49.960 food they're stimulated in the workout00:32:52.880 but that's just phase one phase two the00:32:54.840 actual growth occurs outside the gym and00:32:56.720 it occurs not in any any specific time00:32:58.639 Point like a Magic Window of two hours00:33:01.279 after the gym like that's when all the00:33:02.480 growth occurs that's actually when it00:33:03.840 just starts to go up it's four days00:33:06.480 afterwards so if you train twice a week00:33:08.559 you train on Monday you're going a lot00:33:10.039 of muscle on Monday night Tuesday and00:33:12.080 Wednesday back uh towards the end of00:33:14.000 Wednesday you're just not really growing00:33:15.279 much more muscle you go back to the gym00:33:17.320 Thursday you hit it hard again you hit00:33:19.320 that curve up by Sunday you're totally00:33:21.519 relaxed during Sunday you're not growing00:33:24.159 any muscle your body's really recovering00:33:26.039 a lot of that fatigue and then by Monday00:33:28.159 you're fresh as a pickle and you're00:33:29.360 ready to go at it again how long will it00:33:31.600 take me to lose the muscles that I've00:33:33.320 gained if I don't go back to the gym so00:33:35.200 again focusing on this bicep I train it00:33:37.600 I do two times a week I get it nice and00:33:39.559 big how long before it00:33:42.559 vanishes great question two-part00:33:45.919 answer part one00:33:49.159 is within about two weeks of not00:33:52.039 training00:33:53.120 it the first reduction in muscle that is00:33:57.240 detected by Modern Machinery occurs so00:34:00.679 if you don't lift for 2 weeks and we put00:34:03.679 you in an MRI scanner or a dexa scanner00:34:06.279 let's say a week and a half you don't00:34:07.440 lift I can't tell you're not really00:34:10.119 losing any muscle yet you're just going00:34:11.879 insane and so me personally I'm like00:34:13.839 addicted to lifting so if I don't lift00:34:15.159 for a week I'm like oh my God oh my God00:34:16.599 all my muscle's gone there is some kind00:34:18.760 of intuitive truth to that because when00:34:21.040 you don't stress your muscles they when00:34:23.440 you do stress your muscles they get a00:34:25.280 little bit inflamed and they bulge up a00:34:27.399 little bit B so when you're not training00:34:29.440 for half a week to a week your muscles00:34:32.560 look smaller like they've lost weight00:34:34.280 but it's really just all water that they00:34:35.560 lost you do one gym session thinking00:34:38.399 like oh my God my biceps are gone a week00:34:40.000 and a half later you do one session at00:34:42.079 the end of that you flex and you're like00:34:43.320 oh my God I'm the biggest I've ever been00:34:45.159 I was just delusional that whole time CU00:34:47.079 that stuff comes back super quick after00:34:49.560 about two weeks of not lifting you start00:34:51.760 to lose muscle but it happens really00:34:53.839 really slowly and takes weeks and weeks00:34:55.918 and weeks and weeks after for several00:34:58.200 months of not lifting you're going to00:34:59.920 look considerably smaller in your biceps00:35:02.839 but probably not as small as when you00:35:04.960 started lifting because your muscles00:35:06.960 have a certain memory if we can call it00:35:08.920 that is that true that thing oh yeah and00:35:12.200 so a lot of times when you gain an00:35:13.760 initial amount of muscle especially if00:35:15.280 you've been at it for years it just00:35:17.359 never goes back to the same size as when00:35:19.079 you started it's just always going to be00:35:20.920 bigger until you reach your 80s or00:35:22.960 something like that that being said yes00:35:26.599 you will notice reductions size so two00:35:28.440 weeks is the direct answer there and00:35:30.599 it's going to take weeks and weeks and00:35:31.960 months and months to recede however00:35:33.520 here's part two and this is awesome news00:35:36.480 because of that muscle memory00:35:38.720 situation however long it took you to00:35:41.079 gain the muscles00:35:42.839 initially it's going to take you an00:35:45.839 order of magnitude a factor of 10ish or00:35:48.760 so less time to get it back if you've00:35:51.960 been more jacked before if you've had00:35:53.880 bigger muscles they come back to their00:35:56.680 old size00:35:58.160 if it took if you you you lifted for00:36:00.240 eight months you got a bigger bicep and00:36:03.119 you stopped Lifting for three months and00:36:04.520 it looks about the same as when you00:36:06.000 started if you're really careful like00:36:07.200 okay it's a little bit bigger but really00:36:08.440 it's just back to square one most people00:36:10.560 think oh my God another eight months00:36:13.480 just to get back to where I started like00:36:15.079 forget the gym the truth is after00:36:18.000 roughly about a month maybe as little as00:36:20.599 3 weeks you're going to have the same00:36:22.240 size biceps that you did in your Peak00:36:24.400 because the degree to which your tissue00:36:26.920 grows if it's been a certain size before00:36:29.079 especially if it was notably bigger than00:36:31.760 normal and you held that around for a00:36:33.720 few months and a few years it comes back00:36:37.160 in a way that is so fast If you00:36:39.680 experience If you experience it yourself00:36:42.160 it's it's like you don't believe that00:36:44.000 it's happening to you you they been able00:36:46.240 to like scientifically test this oh yeah00:36:48.319 all the time yeah retraining studies00:36:49.839 detraining retraining oh yeah they've00:36:51.680 they've done studies where they00:36:52.800 purposefully like lift for a while and00:36:54.560 they stop Lifting for a long time and00:36:55.920 they see how long it takes to get back00:36:57.319 and00:36:58.160 um there's one study I'm familiar with00:37:00.440 offand that there's a group of people00:37:02.640 that trained consistently for multiple00:37:05.119 weeks and there's another group of00:37:07.400 people that trained consistently for a00:37:09.319 few weeks and then took two weeks00:37:11.200 completely off in the middle and then00:37:12.880 just started retraining again for a few00:37:14.359 weeks later both groups had identically00:37:17.680 sized differences in muscle at the end00:37:19.680 of the study and so we were like okay so00:37:21.680 so that group that trained consistently00:37:23.280 never took two weeks off could we say00:37:25.839 that they purposefully like dunked two00:37:28.359 weeks of their time away for nothing00:37:30.599 uhhuh yeah your body goes right back00:37:33.839 into regaining old lost muscle so00:37:36.880 rapidly that this is such great news00:37:39.960 because look let's say you lifted00:37:41.839 consistently most of the Year holiday00:37:43.880 season comes up Winter00:37:45.520 holidays you're not going to the gym as00:37:47.920 much maybe not at all three weeks later00:37:50.240 of no gym you look at yourself you look00:37:52.040 a little small or kind of deflated and00:37:53.560 you're like oh my God I'm going to have00:37:55.760 to restart all this from scrap00:37:58.079 nope two weeks later you're in the best00:38:00.640 shape of your life again if you left the00:38:02.720 gym for 6 months one or two months later00:38:05.680 you're in the best shape of your life00:38:06.920 again that's how rapidly it comes back00:38:08.720 so it's really good news for anyone who00:38:09.960 hasn't been in the gym and is feeling00:38:11.119 guilty about it go back get consistent00:38:13.280 again you're just going to Skyrocket00:38:15.839 that is very exciting because yeah we00:38:17.880 always have sometimes it's the trough00:38:19.960 the the couple of weeks off that makes00:38:21.480 us demotivated cuz that's crossed my00:38:23.400 mind before Oh my God that took me three00:38:24.839 months to get there and it's going to00:38:26.599 take me another 3 months to get back but00:38:28.920 what about so if I'm training that bicep00:38:31.240 how have I got to think about stretching00:38:33.560 and warming up before I start before I00:38:36.040 get going with my training there are00:38:38.079 many ways to do it but uh there's some00:38:41.040 research on this recently00:38:43.000 actually you don't need much one of the00:38:46.560 simplest ways to warm up that we00:38:48.520 recommended RP and our app has it in the00:38:50.760 in the00:38:52.280 instructions you want let's say you have00:38:54.480 your final weight already picked out00:38:56.640 like last week did 20 lb dumbbells for00:38:59.680 sets of 15 this week it's sets of 1600:39:02.240 with the 20 lb dumbbells what you want00:39:04.359 to do is you want to do very lightweight00:39:08.680 maybe the 5B dumbbells for a set of 1200:39:12.079 just to get everything moving and00:39:13.160 grooving good technique same technique00:39:14.599 you're going to00:39:15.640 use 30 seconds of rest a minute of rest00:39:19.359 you pick up00:39:21.880 the 10 or 15 PB dumbbells you do a set00:39:25.000 of eight reps there a little bit more00:39:26.640 challenging your feel your grooove a00:39:28.040 little bit but your body is already more00:39:29.240 warm your nervous system is more active00:39:30.800 your muscles are more00:39:32.319 pliable you rest a minute after that and00:39:36.119 then you'll pick up the weight you're00:39:37.400 actually using the 20 Pounders and00:39:39.800 you'll do a set of two to four reps with00:39:41.599 them just to get the feel of that heavy00:39:43.520 weight that you're going to be doing to00:39:44.880 climatize not just your muscles and your00:39:46.839 nervous system but your psychology to00:39:48.359 like okay this is this is the business00:39:49.640 weight that I'm going to be using so 1200:39:52.560 84 rest another 30 seconds first working00:39:56.040 set of whatever 6 reps you're up when00:40:00.079 you have multiple exercises for the same00:40:01.800 muscle group you just need to do one set00:40:04.560 of like four to eight reps in that00:40:07.240 middle weight range between zero and00:40:09.200 whatever you're going to do just to get00:40:10.800 the feel of the exercise because you're00:40:12.079 already generally warm in that area one00:40:14.520 little warmup set rest uh you know 3000:40:16.720 seconds to a minute and then hit your00:40:18.000 first set if you're switching which00:40:20.319 muscles you're using like you were00:40:21.520 training chest but then in the same00:40:22.839 session you started training back that00:40:24.880 first back exercise 1284 the weight goes00:40:28.079 up up up the Reps go down down down just00:40:30.200 a little bit of time between and then00:40:31.800 you hit your first work set you're good00:40:32.960 to go you don't have to do cardio before00:40:35.280 you don't have to get on the treadmill00:40:36.319 you can if you like it you don't have to00:40:38.079 do some kind of cardio warm-up you don't00:40:40.000 have to do any kind of stretching or00:40:41.280 anything like that you don't have to do00:40:42.560 any kind of weird bosu ball band around00:40:44.440 your neck crazy potentiation exercises00:40:47.119 just that little ramp up is basically00:40:50.119 98% of all cases exactly and only what00:40:52.760 you need to do what is a warm-up what is00:40:55.119 going on physiologically inside my00:40:56.640 muscle cuz we we all just warm up and I00:40:58.640 don't think anybody actually knows what00:41:00.000 what's going on yeah so your muscle00:41:04.079 tissues um they have uh they have00:41:08.440 physical qualities that can be measured00:41:10.200 almost in like a fluid dynamics terms00:41:12.119 like viscosity and hysteresis and all00:41:14.560 that stuff and so when you're very cold00:41:19.920 a lot of times the uh there's kind of a00:41:23.200 Frailty implied there as you're warming00:41:26.359 up you're sending blood to around the00:41:28.920 muscle the muscle itself is literally00:41:30.920 becoming warmer and a lot of those kind00:41:34.200 of tight structures that are uh they00:41:36.800 proteins that are made of kind of a00:41:38.040 stretchy material they loosen up a00:41:39.680 little bit and that allows you to go00:41:43.880 through that full range of motion and00:41:45.079 training and not actually get hurt and00:41:48.520 that's from the muscle perspective you00:41:50.720 also get some kind of chemical stuff00:41:52.280 that happens and certain structures fill00:41:53.839 up with chemicals certain structures00:41:55.480 chemicals go down and that gets you00:41:56.880 ready to perform super hard work but00:41:59.960 that's part of the story the other part00:42:01.160 is the nervous system because your00:42:03.440 nervous system is also getting warmed up00:42:05.200 and in technical terms it's called00:42:07.280 potentiation when you just show up to00:42:10.359 the gym and you let's say we said look00:42:13.359 okay we re-engineered your tendons when00:42:15.000 you were asleep you're not going to get00:42:16.720 hurt it's impossible for you to get hurt00:42:18.079 like a car would have to hit you for you00:42:19.280 to rip your bicep off you can just go00:42:21.520 and just hit the curls right away you00:42:23.680 wouldn't get hurt but it would feel00:42:25.480 really strange and you wouldn't get four00:42:27.680 or five reps close to where you're00:42:29.440 supposed to be from last week because00:42:31.319 your nervous system was like what hell00:42:33.559 is going on I'm supposed to be doing00:42:35.359 something so you need warm up the00:42:36.319 nervous system a part of that is00:42:38.119 literally like the actual nervous system00:42:39.800 itself down to the C Level is Flushing00:42:42.280 all kinds of metabolites through the00:42:43.680 connections are getting stronger you're00:42:45.920 uh sort of doing a little bit of kind of00:42:47.319 mini rewiring of primary motor cortex to00:42:50.200 say go oh we're doing curls this is how00:42:52.599 you execute this pattern another part is00:42:55.119 technical like oh this is the technique00:42:57.480 I'm going to do because if you just get00:42:58.960 in the muscle and just do stuff like00:43:00.920 imagine if I told you like hey here's a00:43:02.280 ball just like go go shoot some hoops00:43:04.040 just hit that you know three-pointer00:43:05.640 shot you're00:43:06.720 like I need a couple shots to remind my00:43:09.880 body of what it's like to shoot the00:43:11.720 basketball same idea for lifting you to00:43:13.880 remind your body of what a curl motion00:43:15.640 is and if you remind it a couple sets in00:43:17.520 a row by the time you hit that real00:43:19.400 working set that fourth set your body's00:43:21.559 like I know exactly what I'm going to do00:43:24.160 which parts of the muscle I'm going to00:43:26.119 activate to contract which other parts00:43:28.079 of other muscles am going to activate to00:43:29.680 relax and co-contract to make this whole00:43:31.680 thing happen what are the the other sort00:43:33.800 of common mistakes people make when they00:43:35.920 they go to the gym or they start00:43:36.960 training or they start exercising so00:43:38.839 there I've I've kind of ticked off not00:43:41.240 stretching and taking on a heavy load00:43:43.960 too quickly um but also ramping up00:43:46.920 volumes and loads too fast so that sort00:43:49.200 of over strained before my body is ready00:43:50.920 for it are there any really other sort00:43:52.960 of common obvious mistakes people make00:43:55.200 that inhibit their progress00:43:58.240 one of them is a failure to pay00:44:00.839 attention to good technique okay there00:44:04.040 are sort of some Universal principles of00:44:05.880 what is good technique in the gym for00:44:07.359 muscle00:44:08.280 growth one of them is are you moving in00:44:11.720 a way that properly activates stimulates00:44:14.880 that muscle to actually get it to grow00:44:17.800 because if you do a curl that arcs up it00:44:22.040 does a lot of bicep if you do a curl00:44:24.280 that arcs back this way because the00:44:26.440 bicep is being pulled one way and pulled00:44:28.839 the other way at the shoulder and the00:44:30.720 elbow it ends up doing more of um00:44:33.480 stabilizing contraction than actually00:44:35.760 being the prime mover for the movement00:44:37.960 so when you see people curling at the00:44:39.240 gym and they're just kind of doing this00:44:40.400 you're like yes that is training your00:44:43.119 biceps but if you just moved a little00:44:45.839 bit differently it would be so so much00:44:47.400 better here's another example squatting00:44:49.319 right for your legs if you squat really00:44:52.760 far back and not so far down like you're00:44:57.040 your glutes get hit okay your lower back00:44:59.280 and upper and midback is going to get00:45:00.920 hit a lot but because there's not a huge00:45:03.559 change in your knee angle you're not00:45:06.119 getting a ton of quad stimulus if you00:45:08.160 stay more upright and your heels and00:45:10.880 toes are on the ground and you allow00:45:13.240 your knees to go Way Forward beyond your00:45:15.880 toes as you stay upright and sink down00:45:18.520 really low so that your knee goes into00:45:19.960 one of these oh my God it's all quads00:45:23.000 all day long so you want technique that00:45:25.520 is targeting the muscle it's very00:45:27.720 similar rep to rep to rep and it puts00:45:30.400 the muscle consistently through a range00:45:32.720 of motion that is in that deep painful00:45:35.640 uh length and stretch position if you00:45:37.760 just have all those three everything00:45:39.480 else we can say about your Technique is00:45:41.079 just nuances and finer points those are00:45:43.079 really the big ones we talked about00:45:45.000 nutrition earlier as well so if I want00:45:46.920 to make my bicep grow and also drop off00:45:50.720 the weight around the bicep so you can00:45:52.520 see see it even more what should I be00:45:54.440 putting into my00:45:55.599 mouth the number one requisite for00:45:58.160 muscle growth is00:46:00.160 protein foods with lots of protein in00:46:04.079 them ideally should be consumed three to00:46:07.400 five times per day at roughly00:46:09.640 equidistant intervals breakfast lunch00:46:12.319 dinner totally fine even better00:46:14.440 breakfast lunch dinner evening00:46:17.000 snack the average person00:46:20.240 needs a little bit less than let's say a00:46:24.359 gram per pound of body weight per day of00:46:26.480 protein actually considerably less00:46:28.559 that's kind of the top limit and a cool00:46:30.559 aspirational thing to shoot for so if00:46:33.720 you weigh let's say 200 lb you should be00:46:37.200 consuming something like 150 to 20000:46:39.599 grams of protein per day and 150 for00:46:41.640 almost everyone's totally enough but if00:46:43.520 you're real serious and hardcore and00:46:45.119 just want that insurance policy 20000:46:46.680 grams of protein per day so then if00:46:48.680 you're eating four times a day that's oh00:46:51.160 yeah 30 40 let's say 40 to 50 grams of00:46:55.200 protein per meal can I eat too much00:46:57.800 protein and and then it becomes fat or00:47:00.359 something uh that's uh so protein by00:47:03.319 itself no if your protein is so high00:47:06.040 that your carbs and fats are the same00:47:08.160 and you jack up your protein super high00:47:09.720 but your carbs and fats stay where they00:47:11.440 are your calories become excessive that00:47:14.040 will cause fing over time but if you're00:47:16.119 doing a diet where you take a ton of00:47:17.640 protein but you dropped your carbs and00:47:19.119 fats and your calories are at00:47:20.559 maintenance levels you're not going to00:47:21.880 gain any fat it's not bad for your00:47:23.839 kidneys it's not bad for any other part00:47:25.520 of your body excessive protein as a00:47:28.559 health malady has been a myth the entire00:47:31.000 time and that's one of those um Notions00:47:33.280 that people carry with them that too00:47:35.000 much protein is bad right like yes if00:47:36.559 you've had kidney surgery absolutely00:47:38.359 short of that you're probably good to go00:47:40.640 you'll fart a lot and people will hate00:47:42.119 you but you know you mentioned three to00:47:44.800 five meals a00:47:46.040 day a lot of people are now in this Camp00:47:48.760 of of fasting an intermittent fasting00:47:51.720 and not eating often is it possible to00:47:53.839 fast but also to gain muscle mass in the00:47:56.200 way that you've described yeah totally00:47:58.000 it just won't happen at as an impressive00:47:59.920 rate so you have to make a trade-off for00:48:01.599 yourself if you want you know most00:48:03.839 jacked Steven that you can be three to00:48:05.720 five meals a day consistently spread in00:48:07.880 almost to an00:48:09.839 individual competitive bodybuilders eat00:48:13.720 that frequently and eat high protein how00:48:16.160 often did you eat uh I eat five five00:48:18.599 times a day four or five times a day00:48:20.079 usually and do you eat before or after00:48:22.040 you train both okay so before you train00:48:24.720 and after you train do you different00:48:26.160 things a times I'll train early in the00:48:27.920 morning and so I won't train at I won't00:48:29.640 eat at all I'll wake up and I'll have00:48:31.559 like a protein and carb mix shake with00:48:33.400 my training totally optional super extra00:48:36.079 credit may not do anything at all if you00:48:38.200 look at the literature but I find it a00:48:40.000 little bit compelling to do a little bit00:48:41.240 of that and then afterwards I have my00:48:43.200 first post-workout meal second meal00:48:45.119 third meal fourth meal bedtime wake up00:48:47.040 do it again what you take to get you00:48:49.280 going do you do pre-workout no why no uh00:48:51.920 I don't do any stimulants of any kind00:48:54.040 why uh I'm just kind of coked up all the00:48:56.960 time naturally so like if you give me00:48:59.280 stimulants it's just going to go into00:49:01.040 the not so pleasant side of side effects00:49:03.319 like I'm just going to be like this and00:49:04.960 way too amped up super high anxiety and00:49:07.640 my thoughts get to be like I have less00:49:09.440 fluidity of thinking and stuff so I just00:49:11.799 it just a lot of me I guess and so when00:49:14.079 I wake up in the morning I don't need00:49:15.520 anything to get me going I just go and a00:49:17.680 couple warm-up sets later I have all the00:49:19.319 energy I need that's not everyone and so00:49:22.559 some green tea some black coffee or some00:49:24.920 pre-workout 30 minutes before the the00:49:26.880 gym is great advice for a ton of people00:49:28.839 I feel like pre-workout can't be healthy00:49:30.799 if you're doing it five six seven times00:49:32.799 a week because some of that stuff is so00:49:34.799 unbelievably strong like I've had it00:49:36.720 before I've got literally like heart00:49:37.839 palpitations when I've had a pre-workout00:49:39.400 and you know you talk about anxiety that00:49:41.200 anxious feeling it can't be it can't be00:49:43.640 help healthy for people to be doing that00:49:46.200 frequently it seems to be quite fine it00:49:49.079 seems to be quite fine now at the00:49:50.839 extremes and in for some individuals00:49:53.440 it's not ideal but um the upper limit00:49:57.400 dose of caffeine in milligrams per day00:50:01.520 at which we can confidently say most00:50:03.400 people will experience the beginnings of00:50:06.000 Health00:50:07.000 maladies is a th00000:50:09.760 milligrams and a cup of coffee has00:50:12.440 depending on which cup 50 to 100 now00:50:15.440 some pre-workouts have 250 gr milligrams00:50:18.799 of caffeine some have00:50:21.160 500 uh last I checked Ronnie Coleman's00:50:24.280 pre-workout has 550 migs of caffeine per00:50:27.720 scoop or per serving and so that's kind00:50:30.119 of a lot uh I if I took 550 migs of00:50:33.640 caffeine you don't take me to the gym00:50:35.720 just take me right to the hospital put00:50:37.400 me in the psychiatric word 36 hours00:50:39.440 later I'll be okay but for some people00:50:41.799 to get so accustomed to high doses of00:50:43.440 caffeine that is supposed not unhealthy00:50:45.240 for them to consume and also uh they00:50:47.760 feel quite fine so I would say start00:50:49.599 with as little as you need to get you00:50:51.160 going and if you need to tight trate and00:50:52.640 work up from there that's a good thing00:50:54.760 the other thing I would say is I would00:50:57.200 have a compelling case for pre-workout00:50:59.559 or stimulant if I ask you like hey how00:51:02.400 much energy do you typically have at the00:51:03.640 gym you're like well that's super great00:51:05.599 and they're like should I take00:51:06.520 pre-workout I'd be like no there's no00:51:08.240 compelling case for that at all if00:51:09.920 you're like look I wake up in the00:51:10.839 morning some days I just don't get a ton00:51:12.599 of sleep and I need something to get me00:51:14.920 going not every day but sometimes I'll00:51:16.799 be like hey look consider green tea00:51:19.680 black coffee some diet soda or all the00:51:22.920 way up to pre-workout if you need it but00:51:25.440 some people take it kind of a like um a00:51:28.319 like a religious thing as a habit uh as00:51:31.160 a ritual and it's like dude you're00:51:33.240 training your forms and biceps for 2000:51:36.000 minutes total at 900 p.m. you do not00:51:38.599 need three scoops of pre-workout for00:51:40.440 that I don't even know where it's going00:51:42.000 at that point so some people get a00:51:43.280 little crazy with the pre-workouts at00:51:44.839 the end of the world it's at at best00:51:48.839 needless what's your stance on the whole00:51:50.960 idea of calories in calories out a lot00:51:53.359 of people just focus on that as their00:51:55.520 their sort of their script to lose body00:51:59.359 weight lose body fat and gain muscle is00:52:02.640 is that a useful frame to to use and why00:52:05.839 do so many people fail at it if if it is00:52:08.319 a useful frame most people fail at it00:52:11.240 because they don't consider both the00:52:13.440 calories in and calories outside of the00:52:16.559 equation and a lot of people fail00:52:18.920 because they're very bad at estimating00:52:20.680 food amounts and calories they someone00:52:23.359 will say like a tablespoon of peanut00:52:25.000 butter Stephen if you ever actually seen00:52:27.119 a tablespoon measuring cup it does not00:52:30.200 look like Mom's tablespoon where she00:52:32.119 takes the peanut butter and goes that's00:52:34.640 like four tablespoons and so like but00:52:36.720 I'm eating the calories blah blah blah00:52:39.599 every time you take people into what's00:52:41.319 called a metabolic Ward which is a study00:52:44.040 center where you're not allowed to have00:52:45.880 visitors that bring you food the workers00:52:48.240 only give you the food that you need and00:52:49.760 all of your exercise and your output is00:52:51.720 controlled and monitored and so is your00:52:53.359 intake no one has ever violated laws of00:52:55.960 thermodynamic we give you a certain00:52:57.440 number of calories and we expect you to00:52:58.760 lose a certain number of weight there's00:52:59.799 a variance about that but it you're00:53:02.720 going to lose the weight that roughly we00:53:04.520 predict if we account for all variables00:53:05.880 you're going to lose almost exactly the00:53:07.040 weight that we predict so calories in00:53:08.240 calories out is incontrovertible in00:53:10.599 among 90s something per 98% of people00:53:15.000 who do research in the field and are00:53:16.359 scientifically literate and educated00:53:18.160 calories in calories out is not00:53:19.640 controversial it never has been there00:53:21.559 are some people who say well calorie00:53:24.400 counting didn't work for me that's00:53:26.920 probably because you did it wrong or you00:53:29.000 weren't even concerned about how much00:53:30.400 protein you're taking in or how many00:53:31.640 carbs or how many fats there are other00:53:33.040 details that matter like if you say I00:53:36.880 need a V8 engine in a car that's all00:53:38.760 that matters like okay well there's no00:53:40.240 steering wheel there's no pedals cool00:53:42.160 well okay I need those things too so00:53:44.200 calories and calories out is the very00:53:45.839 core because without an engine you're00:53:46.920 not going anywhere but what types of00:53:50.119 foods you're eating matters a little bit00:53:52.200 are you getting enough protein carbs00:53:53.480 fats that matters a bit too so people00:53:55.319 like to just bash calorie balance and00:53:58.040 calories in calories out is well it's00:53:59.559 it's totally myth it doesn't work no no00:54:01.000 it works great it's just not always00:54:03.400 enough to get you in the best shape you00:54:04.760 can but if you do it right as far as net00:54:07.400 balance weight gain or weight loss00:54:09.720 calories in calories out is actually the00:54:11.520 only thing that matters tissue wise is00:54:14.760 that gain mostly muscle or mostly fat is00:54:17.160 the loss mostly muscle or mostly fat00:54:19.079 that has not so much to do with calories00:54:20.760 it has much more to do with proteins00:54:22.799 carbs fats the quality of food you're00:54:24.680 eating nutrient timing and all the rest00:54:26.440 of it so calories and calories out is00:54:27.680 amazing super explanatory critical but00:54:30.359 it's just not the whole picture and00:54:32.319 that's really it I guess because so many00:54:33.680 people say they've heard about calories00:54:35.319 and calories out but they fail at00:54:38.480 maintaining it now that's really about00:54:40.599 motivation and the psychology of doing00:54:42.200 such a thing um some people have said to00:54:44.079 me that our bodies want to defend our00:54:45.559 weight so if we start eating less we'll00:54:47.720 become a little bit more hungry if we go00:54:49.040 for a run after the run or after00:54:51.119 physical exertion our body will try and00:54:52.760 make up for it because it's programmed00:54:54.079 to try and defend its weight because its00:54:55.960 weight cor relates to our ability to00:54:58.520 survive00:55:00.119 um why do people fail at it one of the00:55:02.680 reasons you said is because you know00:55:04.160 that they're not actually measuring the00:55:05.440 calories correctly but the psychological00:55:07.480 reasons that it isn't hasn't worked for00:55:10.000 some people can you think of many00:55:12.359 because when I when people talk about00:55:13.440 calories in calories out if you look at00:55:15.000 the comment sections on those videos00:55:16.240 people say I've tried this and it didn't00:55:17.319 work okay so first of all I typically00:55:20.160 don't look at comment sections of videos00:55:21.760 because comment section is not00:55:23.520 representative of the population it's00:55:25.720 not represent reprentative of the people00:55:27.480 that watch your videos it's not00:55:28.799 representative of the hardcore00:55:30.000 demographic that watches your videos so00:55:32.640 just as a statistical artifact every00:55:35.000 single Claim by people against calorie00:55:37.520 balance in that comment section could be00:55:40.000 true for them but they represent 1% of00:55:42.599 the population so 99% of people at works00:55:44.920 just fine for 1% they get into some kind00:55:47.119 of trouble usually that trouble is they00:55:49.440 didn't count calories properly they00:55:51.480 didn't account for macronutrient profile00:55:53.280 proteins carbs fats they didn't account00:55:54.680 for nutrient timing or the kinds of food00:55:56.480 that they're they're doing and so on and00:55:57.680 so forth and another one is like you00:56:00.559 said00:56:01.799 sustainability how long do I have to00:56:04.200 count calories for in my life for me to00:56:06.920 get the body that I want and keep it is00:56:08.799 sure [ __ ] not going to be forever so00:56:10.520 what I'll do is I'll count calories for00:56:11.880 a few months I'll lose a lot of weight00:56:13.400 then I'll go back to eating on Vibes and00:56:14.960 the weight comes right back absolutely00:56:17.039 so better than just counting calories00:56:19.559 what we want to do is instill people00:56:21.200 with good eating habits if you learn how00:56:23.400 to construct meals made of lean proteins00:56:25.760 veggies fruits whole grains healthy fats00:56:28.200 you know roughly how to see how much00:56:30.000 food you need and how much food looks at00:56:32.039 least like it's what you eat per day if00:56:33.839 you're checking your body weight00:56:35.000 relatively often and when your body00:56:37.039 weight starts to get a little higher you00:56:38.319 kind of clean up your diet a little bit00:56:40.039 uh and when your body weight's nice and00:56:41.240 low you couple cheat meals couple kebabs00:56:43.680 you know burgers and stuff that's all00:56:45.359 good if you do that and you have those00:56:46.640 healthy habits whatever weight you lost00:56:48.400 on calorie restriction you can maintain00:56:50.920 with very very little work not counting00:56:53.839 a damn thing just on good habits but but00:56:56.799 if you counted calories you do some00:56:58.559 weird diet where you only eat like too00:57:00.200 with orange slices and protein shakes or00:57:02.280 something yeah the calorie counting will00:57:04.319 get you wherever you need to go but then00:57:06.160 afterwards like the diet's over and00:57:07.480 you're like now what do I do like uh00:57:10.200 good luck going out in the world and00:57:11.799 feating the same diet that got you fat00:57:13.559 in the first place that's the big kicker00:57:15.880 people might say it takes too much time00:57:17.880 to count calories it leads to a an00:57:20.599 unhealthy relationship with food I think00:57:22.640 there's a big movement at the moment to00:57:23.799 trying to get calories off menus because00:57:25.839 it's said to increase the amount of00:57:27.799 people that have eating disorders and00:57:28.920 things like00:57:30.799 that is that a a conversation worth00:57:34.799 entertaining in this in this regard sure00:57:36.839 sure very few people will develop Eating00:57:40.880 Disorders based on increases in00:57:43.079 information they are presented I would00:57:45.559 actually call that eating order instead00:57:47.039 of eating00:57:48.400 disorder most people who get Eating00:57:50.440 Disorders are highly at risk genetically00:57:53.119 and with a few other social00:57:55.000 circumstances00:57:57.280 Eating Disorders are uh for example the00:58:00.799 most uh deleterious Eating Disorders00:58:04.039 anorexia00:58:05.640 nervosa seen not exclusively but almost00:58:09.559 exclusively in females of reproductive00:58:12.000 age they ain't calories on a menu doing00:58:14.839 that that's something you bring into the00:58:17.359 table usually because you have the00:58:19.440 genetic proclivity for it and00:58:21.880 additionally because you've been in a00:58:24.119 social and cultural circumstance where00:58:27.079 not only were you the wrong person to00:58:28.920 get ridiculed for your weight but also a00:58:31.839 lot of people ridiculed you for your00:58:33.319 weight and then you go all careening off00:58:35.839 on this path where no one can even tell00:58:37.520 you're super skinny anymore because you00:58:38.760 don't believe it so the idea that uh00:58:42.200 you're going to see much higher00:58:43.200 prevalence globally in Eating Disorders00:58:44.839 from putting menu calorie labels on00:58:46.680 things is true by this much at the00:58:49.400 margins and it's just largely not the00:58:51.839 case adjacent to that is this idea of00:58:54.160 muscle dysmorphia which affects00:58:56.599 a lot of people but specifically men00:58:58.839 roughly 87% of men that are between 1500:59:01.960 to 32 years old that experience muscle00:59:05.200 dysmorphia which is what so muscle00:59:08.920 dysmorphia generally is for whatever00:59:11.799 level of jacked that you are you think00:59:14.520 you are considerably less jacked both in00:59:17.720 reference to yourself and your own00:59:19.359 desires and in reference to an ethereal00:59:21.920 make belief comparator population in00:59:23.920 your head so if you were to ask like hey00:59:26.920 Mike do you feel jacked and I'm like00:59:29.559 nope you're like oo not good not a good00:59:31.720 sign clearly he's jacked and then you00:59:33.640 can ask me Mike compared to other00:59:35.440 40-year-old ashkanazi Jewish men how00:59:38.400 Jacked are you and if I'm like I'm00:59:40.160 probably like bottom 50% for sure00:59:42.520 probably bottom 25 to' be like okay he's00:59:44.480 mentally ill take him away that is high00:59:46.760 level muscle dysmorphia a disassociation00:59:49.760 from any objective reality about how00:59:52.520 much muscle you actually have do people00:59:55.680 over estimate or underestimate their00:59:57.599 appearance as it relates to their00:59:59.039 muscles uh dysmorphia is almost always01:00:01.920 cataloged as an underestimation but but01:00:04.760 from your experience working with people01:00:06.119 do people think they're more jacked than01:00:07.480 they actually are it really depends on01:00:09.760 the individual most people that are in01:00:12.160 gym culture that are very invested if01:00:15.200 you catch them on their not so great01:00:16.799 days they think they're substantially01:00:19.440 less jacked than they really are and if01:00:21.720 you tease it apart via conversation01:00:23.880 they'll end up being like yeah no no I01:00:25.160 know I'm jacked but I'm just saying like01:00:26.880 and then it's aspirational like for my01:00:28.920 goals I'm not as jacked as I would like01:00:31.079 to be it's interesting because we01:00:32.799 typically think of women I think01:00:35.319 stereotypically in society as caring01:00:38.160 more about their body image but I've01:00:41.880 I've read a lot of stats lately that01:00:43.079 suggest men care equally about their01:00:44.920 body image but just in slightly01:00:46.280 different ways and the about the01:00:47.839 correlation between their perception of01:00:49.440 their body image and their own mental01:00:50.720 health and the link between the two sure01:00:53.640 sure do you see a lot of that do you see01:00:55.240 this link between Health in male body01:00:57.160 image yes huge proportion of01:01:00.799 psychological proclivities are genetic01:01:03.200 the others are very individually01:01:05.720 acquired they change through time it's01:01:07.920 not as easy as saying upbringing or01:01:09.680 family environment so the one consistent01:01:12.160 thing about how you relate to the world01:01:13.760 in your own thoughts is genetics and a01:01:16.400 lot of the traits tend to aggregate01:01:18.400 together so it is true to say on a01:01:21.839 spectrum very nuanced that some people01:01:25.240 aggregate a lot of negative01:01:26.799 psychological traits and some people01:01:28.920 aggregate a lot of positives and there01:01:30.520 absolutely people everyone's a mixed bag01:01:32.039 somewhere in between but there's a01:01:33.119 little bit of this kind of I don't want01:01:34.960 to use a a term for another mental a01:01:37.240 bipolarity to the distribution right and01:01:39.839 so a lot of people that are generally01:01:42.359 neurotic they feel consistently uh01:01:45.160 unsafe and unsure of themselves are01:01:47.440 going to be also the type of people that01:01:49.160 when they get more jacked through01:01:50.359 lifting they're still not going to01:01:51.920 believe that they're as jacked and01:01:53.400 accomplished and awesome and alpha male01:01:55.279 as they really are because they're01:01:56.839 always like you know to use the old01:01:58.640 Jewish joke stereotype01:02:00.319 like I'm never going to be big and it's01:02:02.960 like you're already big like oh I don't01:02:04.599 know it could get it could get worse01:02:06.039 tomorrow and a lot of people just bring01:02:08.680 that to the table and so when you get01:02:10.799 neurotic people jacked they don't think01:02:12.520 they're that jacked they're always like01:02:13.760 oh my God it's always going to end but01:02:15.440 if you take not neurotic people and make01:02:17.839 them jacked one week of lifting into01:02:20.799 those people and they're like dude I'm01:02:22.079 like do you think I should turn pro in01:02:23.640 bodybuilding like get out of here you're01:02:25.119 just overon01:02:26.480 so it really depends on who's doing the01:02:28.319 thing now cultural stuff social who's in01:02:30.920 your circle I'll give you a good example01:02:33.520 I have a lot of my closest friends have01:02:36.520 no relation to Fitness whatsoever a01:02:38.279 bunch of them are actually01:02:38.920 neuroscientists just randomly people I01:02:40.880 knew in college that ended up being my01:02:42.319 friends for life and so when they assess01:02:45.079 their muscularity relative to myself and01:02:47.520 my bodybuilder friends they're like I'm01:02:50.079 in terrible shape and I'm not remotely01:02:51.599 jacked and they have such a weird01:02:53.440 comparator population that I always01:02:55.039 remind them like dude dude not everyone01:02:56.599 looks like this they go to the store01:02:57.760 they go to school they go to the bank01:02:58.720 and they're like oh crap you're right01:03:00.359 I'm actually the most jacked person at01:03:01.720 the bank it's just not like Gold's Gym01:03:03.480 where everyone's enormous so if you01:03:05.319 happen to be in an environment let's say01:03:07.400 you're a university student and you go01:03:08.920 to the University gym and there's lots01:03:10.559 of jacked people there and you're there01:03:11.839 all the time trying to do your best you01:03:13.960 may if you're neurotic to begin with01:03:15.720 more neurotic start to develop a sense01:03:17.839 that you're just not nearly as jacked as01:03:20.400 you should be or could be or whatever01:03:22.200 but if you like hang out at an old01:03:23.480 people home with your grandma and01:03:24.599 grandpa all the time you're going to01:03:25.799 feel like Superman all the time because01:03:27.480 holy [ __ ] you're like you can do real01:03:28.960 things and move furniture around and and01:03:31.400 so then go back to that point about01:03:32.440 weight loss if I'm trying to lose weight01:03:34.200 what are the biggest biggest myths01:03:36.200 around weight loss that hold people back01:03:38.440 and inhibit them one is you have to be01:03:40.839 perfect if I'm on my diet I'm good if01:03:43.880 I'm off my diet not only am I bad but as01:03:46.599 soon as I'm off my diet I have sinned01:03:48.880 and there is no Solace for me um I a lot01:03:53.279 of people have that falling off the01:03:54.520 bandwagon thing where eat clean food01:03:57.400 whatever that means diet food for weeks01:03:59.880 and weeks and weeks they have one Kebab01:04:01.799 they have one cheeseburger and they're01:04:03.039 like do it that's it man I'm done01:04:06.880 dieting I'm not a good person anymore01:04:08.599 it's like that whole dichotomizing and01:04:11.119 kind of a religious approach that hurts01:04:13.440 a lot of people because in reality if01:04:15.760 you just Eat A Cheeseburger your body's01:04:17.559 like oh sweet like I got a little bit01:04:18.960 more carbohydrates stored in the muscle01:04:20.960 I recovered a little bit more my diet01:04:22.720 fatigue is actually a little lower01:04:23.839 because you fed me some food tomorrow01:04:26.160 I'm back on the diet I'm making even01:04:27.559 better gains than if I didn't have that01:04:28.839 cheeseburger I was so exhausted and so a01:04:31.680 lot of people have that approach01:04:33.240 completely backwards and they're like01:04:34.480 I'm either good or I'm bad and and01:04:36.559 that's really tough another one is01:04:38.960 people think that the approach to lose01:04:41.160 weight is the same as the approach to01:04:43.039 maintain it um this is really really01:04:45.680 really nasty because so my wife is a uh01:04:48.839 board-certified uh Family Med Sports Med01:04:51.400 doctor and she does a lot of work01:04:53.720 international Olympic teams all that01:04:55.200 stuff01:04:56.279 and she is looking at these formal01:04:59.079 recommendations from the medical01:05:00.520 literature and it's like here's the kind01:05:02.599 of diet you need to get to lose weight01:05:05.480 and then she was like she followed up01:05:07.079 with some of the professionals and she's01:05:08.240 like and so what about maintenance and01:05:09.640 they're like uh yep what do you mean yep01:05:13.559 what are you talking about that's not01:05:15.400 the conversation so people think okay01:05:17.480 I'm going to clean up my diet no more01:05:19.039 ice cream no more no more crisps no more01:05:21.000 Cheetos I'm gonna eat super healthy and01:05:23.960 then when I get to the weight that I01:05:25.279 want01:05:26.480 I eat continuously super Health never01:05:29.799 have ice cream again what kind of01:05:31.520 bizarre world is it and so they'll flop01:05:33.359 back to the other one well they'll try01:05:35.000 for a few months after they've gotten to01:05:36.359 the weight they like to just eat01:05:37.760 completely super healthy clean01:05:39.200 everything like that they lose a little01:05:40.400 bit more weight they're exhausted01:05:41.760 they're tired they're food focus is01:05:43.200 driving them nuts they'll eat some ice01:05:45.319 cream and they'll go I'm a sinner and01:05:47.720 then ice cream ice cream cheeseburgers01:05:49.440 cheeseburgers up they go and then they01:05:51.200 regain all the weight so a huge myth is01:05:53.640 the fact that yeah when you're you're01:05:55.760 losing weight you got to pay a little01:05:57.079 bit more attention to what you eat but01:05:58.960 once you've gotten to that weight you01:06:01.079 both need some time roughly every 301:06:04.079 months that you diet hard to lose weight01:06:06.520 you should be taking about at least two01:06:08.000 months at maintenance just maintaining01:06:09.720 it so if you weigh 100 kilos iron down01:06:11.799 to 90 after 3 months for about two or 301:06:14.559 months just stay at 90 eat mostly the01:06:17.240 healthy stuff that you were but throw a01:06:18.760 little junk in there maintenance again01:06:20.799 is much easier than losing when01:06:23.760 physiologically and psychologically your01:06:26.240 diet fatigue comes down after those two01:06:28.160 or three months you're able if you'd01:06:30.319 like to start dieting really hard again01:06:32.839 to get to that next goal that you have01:06:34.599 or you just live in balance for the rest01:06:36.680 but if we tell you like here's your diet01:06:38.400 to make you lean and healthy and you're01:06:39.520 like okay how long do I have to do this01:06:40.640 and the doctor's like01:06:42.279 forever what what am I supposed to do01:06:44.359 I'm never I'm never allowed to have01:06:45.480 teramis Su after dinner ever again I'm01:06:47.240 like well probably not to that's01:06:49.279 terrible advice and not only do medical01:06:50.920 people too often say that most people01:06:53.039 have that in their heads and it's it's a01:06:54.520 very very untenable sitation one of the01:06:56.599 big sort of narratives that I was01:06:59.079 exposed to for most of my life about01:07:00.720 weight loss is that 80% of its01:07:03.799 diet what do you think about those01:07:05.680 ratios how much of weight loss is01:07:07.240 determined by diet versus exercise01:07:10.480 yeah diet has a bigger effect than01:07:14.000 exercise as a heuristic I'm very01:07:16.240 comfortable with 8020 there are a couple01:07:18.480 reasons for that one01:07:21.200 is there's a constrained energy01:07:24.200 hypothesis01:07:25.920 it's also called ponor Paradox based on01:07:28.119 Herman ponor work and physical01:07:29.960 anthropology and01:07:31.960 so basically they realize that the01:07:34.720 amount of physical activity that humans01:07:36.559 can do has a range but if you try to get01:07:40.520 people to like double their physical01:07:42.559 activity you say I'm not going to change01:07:44.240 my diet I'm GNA work out twice as much01:07:46.559 as the next guy your body becomes so01:07:49.760 fatigued so rapidly and your metabolism01:07:52.799 adjusts itself your physical activity01:07:54.799 that's not planned exercise like how01:07:56.799 much do you get up when someone calls01:07:58.640 you are you still on the couch talking01:08:00.039 to them or how much do you get up and01:08:01.400 walk around your kitchen a bunch your01:08:03.559 body makes all these adjustments so if01:08:05.680 you try to really outwork a bad diet it01:08:08.880 doesn't work and usually you just come01:08:10.839 back to the same physical activity01:08:12.240 because you're too exhausted to continue01:08:13.680 and then you failed whereas with diet01:08:16.600 you can make some dietary changes01:08:18.520 principle based like stop eating junk01:08:21.279 food every day and just eat two pieces01:08:23.839 of junk food on Friday and two pieces of01:08:26.158 junk food on Saturday just that alone is01:08:29.080 sustainable your body as long as these01:08:31.120 are filling Foods a lot of veggies01:08:33.479 fruits whole grains lean meats you're01:08:35.279 not hungry you're just like damn it I01:08:37.679 want a bag of chips that's not a reason01:08:40.279 that is mostly psychological it's not01:08:42.080 physiological and thus dieting is just01:08:44.839 able to take bigger chunks out of your01:08:46.920 calorie balance equation without01:08:49.000 completely destroying it that has limits01:08:50.640 as well you can't D it forever so you01:08:52.759 have to take it in chunks another thing01:08:54.759 is this in order01:08:56.839 to burn a lot of calories to lose a lot01:09:00.600 of weight you got to do some serious01:09:03.560 work the average person will burn01:09:05.679 something like 100 to 150 calories per01:09:09.799 mile01:09:11.040 run oh my God you start thinking about01:09:13.560 it like a doughnut has 300 calories how01:09:17.000 fast Stephen can you eat a doughnut if I01:09:18.799 time01:09:19.719 you 5 Seconds five no problem boom you01:09:23.600 going to run three miles after each01:09:25.040 donut it's insane so taking your diet01:09:28.799 cleaning it up reducing the junk01:09:30.040 reducing the calories is not that hard01:09:32.759 but if you try to fight off the nasty01:09:34.920 extra junk food calories you're taking01:09:36.359 in with exercise it's kind of like a01:09:38.679 three to one fight you you eat two01:09:41.560 Donuts at your work function after work01:09:43.920 you got six miles to run that day nobody01:09:45.920 doing that and that's why diet is such a01:09:49.359 huge factor it's so easy to do quote01:09:51.439 unquote damage with it and it's much01:09:53.359 easier to take control of it versus01:09:55.520 exercise the boundary layers are just01:09:57.480 smaller and what you would have to do to01:09:59.320 fight the bad diet is just grotesquely01:10:01.440 large and outside of those boundary01:10:02.840 layers I think this a lot because I01:10:04.120 think people typically assume that the01:10:05.719 way to lose weight is to go do a run01:10:08.000 yeah that's typically you know you'll01:10:09.679 see people in the gym and if you ask01:10:11.199 someone why they're on the running01:10:12.360 machine they'll probably say I'm trying01:10:13.440 to lose some weight01:10:15.199 yeah it helps a little01:10:17.440 bit but if you run and you burn 20001:10:21.320 calories extra per day 3 days per week01:10:24.239 then is 600 extra calories you're01:10:25.920 burning through the week that's good01:10:28.159 stuff you can lose some decent weight01:10:30.360 like that are you just going to be more01:10:31.719 hungry though afterwards uh typically01:10:34.120 exercise does not dependably increase01:10:36.159 your hunger in most people so uh uh01:10:39.360 depending on the context in the01:10:40.640 individual it's not a Dependable thing01:10:42.360 to say that doing more exercise01:10:43.920 necessarily makes you more hungry which01:10:45.560 is kind of cool because usually you're01:10:46.880 not really any more hungry and if you01:10:48.520 stick consistently exercise but you01:10:50.440 control your diet you're good to go01:10:52.920 however is there a psychological01:10:54.000 component to that where because done the01:10:55.800 run I now feel like I deserve it oh yeah01:10:59.000 that's huge and some people do have a01:11:00.679 hunger response but what you put"
