==**Implementation Intention:**== ==**A plan you make beforehand about when and where to act**== ==**(How you intend to implement a particular habit)**==

  

==**2 most common habit cues are time and location**==

  

==**“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y”**==

  

==**People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through**==

  

==**Too many people try to change their habits without these basics figured out**==

  

==**We leave it up to chance and hope that we will “just remember to do it” or feel motivated at the right time**==

  

==**When the moment of action occurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.**==

  

==**“I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]”**==

  

==**If you aren’t sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month, or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher. If we have hope, we have a reason to take action. A fresh start feels motivating**==

  

==**Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world**==

  

==**The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why**==

  

### Habit Stacking: A simple plan to overhaul your habits

  

==**The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.**==

  

==**Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behaviour**==

  

==**Habit Stacking:**== ==**One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behaviour on top.**==

  

==**Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit**==

  

==**“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]”**==

  

==**The key is to tie your desired behaviour into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. This allows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behaviour leading into the next, a positive version of the Diderot Effect**==

==**You can also insert new behaviours into the middle of your current routines.**==

  

==**Overall, habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules that guide your future behaviour. It’s like you always have a game plan for which action should come next. Once you get comfortable with this approach, you can develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the situation is appropriate.**==

  

==**No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off.**==

  

==**Unlike an implementation intention, which specifically states the time and location for a given behaviour, habit stacking implicitly has the time and location built into it. When and where you choose to insert a habit into your daily routine can make a big difference**==

  

==**Consider when you are most likely to be successful**==

  

==**Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with something else. Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit**==

  

==**Best way to find the right trigger for your habit stack:**==

1. ==**Brainstorm a list of your current habits**==
2. ==**In the 1st column write the habits you do every day without fail**==
3. ==**In the 2nd column write down the things that happen to you every day without fail**==

  

==**Search for the best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle**==

  

==**Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable.**==

  

==**Don’t select a cue that is too vague. Be specific and clear.**==

  

==**The specificity is important. The more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the time comes to act.**==

  

==**Implementation intention and habit stacking is one of the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action**==
