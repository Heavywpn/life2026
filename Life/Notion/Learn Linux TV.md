welcome back to learn Linux TV  <br>00:00:17.439 as you can probably tell if you're a  <br>00:00:19.279 subscriber of this channel already I'm  <br>00:00:21.119 not in my usual location actually I'm in  <br>00:00:24.439 Sydney Nova Scotia Canada and I'm here  <br>00:00:27.160 at 45 drives headquarters for their  <br>00:00:29.960 Creator Summit and I'm having a ton of  <br>00:00:31.840 fun in fact I'm one of several YouTubers  <br>00:00:34.840 that are here at this event and one of  <br>00:00:37.760 which is Brett he's known on YouTube as  <br>00:00:39.800 raid owl and he's been someone that I've  <br>00:00:42.360 talked to for quite some time now but I  <br>00:00:44.600 haven't had a chance to collaborate with  <br>00:00:46.239 him until now so what I'm going to do in  <br>00:00:48.640 today's video is play back an interview  <br>00:00:50.719 that I had with him where we discussed  <br>00:00:52.920 what's wrong with Linux but before we  <br>00:00:55.280 get to that though I need to make you  <br>00:00:56.879 aware that my merchandise shop the  <br>00:00:58.879 official merch shop for learn Linux TV  <br>00:01:00.800 has been recently updated with brand new  <br>00:01:03.000 products inside the shop you'll find  <br>00:01:05.040 drro themed shirts bags drink wear and  <br>00:01:07.400 more and there's some other surprises  <br>00:01:09.280 there as well for example I've just  <br>00:01:11.200 introduced a mouse pad that doubles as a  <br>00:01:12.920 t-mo cheat sheet how cool is that you  <br>00:01:15.520 could get yourself something really cool  <br>00:01:17.280 and support Linux learning at the same  <br>00:01:19.240 time so it's a win-win thank you so much  <br>00:01:21.799 for supporting learn Linux TV I really  <br>00:01:23.880 appreciate it now at this point what  <br>00:01:25.840 we're going to do is play back the  <br>00:01:27.720 interview that I had with Brett but I  <br>00:01:29.520 want you to be prepared to subscribe to  <br>00:01:32.320 his channel you're going to want to if  <br>00:01:34.000 you haven't already done so anyway let's  <br>00:01:36.119 check out the  <br>00:01:39.680 interview all right so I'm here with  <br>00:01:41.680 Brett from the YouTube channel raid owl  <br>00:01:44.079 how you doing I'm doing good and it's  <br>00:01:46.880 Brett not Brent I want to be clear on  <br>00:01:48.520 that it's Brett not Brent not Brad I've  <br>00:01:51.799 gotten quite a few ones but yeah Brett  <br>00:01:53.719 Brad seems kind of hard to get out of  <br>00:01:55.159 that I don't know how I can't excuse  <br>00:01:56.719 that it's it's I guess it's my accent  <br>00:01:59.320 something with with Southern Accents  <br>00:02:01.520 make it really hard for people to  <br>00:02:02.880 understand Brett like it's it's usually  <br>00:02:04.240 a 50/50 for people to get my name right  <br>00:02:06.240 which is impressive but so we're here at  <br>00:02:09.720 45 drives HQ in Nova Scotia Canada  <br>00:02:13.760 Sydney um and it's been several days  <br>00:02:17.400 like I'm losing track of time like I  <br>00:02:18.760 always do but we've had uh a number of  <br>00:02:21.280 discussions we're brought in for a very  <br>00:02:23.440 specific P purpose um what I was  <br>00:02:25.720 thinking we could do is kind of talk a  <br>00:02:27.760 little bit about your presentation  <br>00:02:30.400 um and then maybe some of the experience  <br>00:02:33.000 that we had here at 45 drives okay yeah  <br>00:02:36.319 so my presentation and and all 45 drives  <br>00:02:40.280 brought us creators in to discuss uh D  <br>00:02:44.959 microsof ification that was the theme of  <br>00:02:47.879 yeah they made sure to make sure you say  <br>00:02:49.959 that right yes it's basically about how  <br>00:02:51.840 do we get from Windows dominating  <br>00:02:54.840 everything to having a more open source  <br>00:02:59.680 uh Community I mean we have one but I  <br>00:03:02.200 mean like how do we get that in the end  <br>00:03:03.519 users hands how do we adjust from being  <br>00:03:05.280 so relying on Windows to right open  <br>00:03:07.959 source so we all did presentations and  <br>00:03:12.080 um mine was on my 30 days of Linux  <br>00:03:17.159 challenge in which I failed uh I have a  <br>00:03:20.040 video on it it was an attempt to use  <br>00:03:23.799 Linux only for 30 days now I'm a I'm a  <br>00:03:26.159 Mac person I use a Macbook for Mac OS  <br>00:03:29.879 obviously and my main workstation is  <br>00:03:32.239 Windows machine and I was like I will  <br>00:03:35.599 put Linux Mint on a Dell xps15 and I  <br>00:03:39.560 will use that for 30 days and I will  <br>00:03:41.760 document my experience um I am not a  <br>00:03:44.400 Linux expert you are a Linux expert um I  <br>00:03:48.720 ran into issues I failed if you watch  <br>00:03:50.959 the video it's in the title everything I  <br>00:03:52.920 I I failed at 22 days um for various  <br>00:03:56.560 reasons and I talked about that and we  <br>00:03:58.040 had a lively discussion about why may be  <br>00:04:01.319 um and yeah it was it was just a good  <br>00:04:03.599 discussion if you want me to go into  <br>00:04:04.920 like some of the specifics yeah I think  <br>00:04:06.480 we will I just wanted to say that um I  <br>00:04:09.000 don't think you failed because you don't  <br>00:04:11.519 fail when you try and I think failure is  <br>00:04:14.319 not even even trying in the first place  <br>00:04:16.680 because I see a lot of times where  <br>00:04:18.160 people will barely try you know they'll  <br>00:04:20.040 try a live CD for an hour right and  <br>00:04:23.040 that's it and then they're done um but  <br>00:04:25.240 that was a serious attempt and I feel  <br>00:04:27.160 like you never know what's at the end of  <br>00:04:28.800 that you could be oh this is the best  <br>00:04:30.520 thing ever I've switched everything or I  <br>00:04:32.240 got to switch back because it didn't  <br>00:04:33.720 work out but um my understanding from  <br>00:04:36.479 your presentation was very reasonable  <br>00:04:38.360 you you ran into some very valid  <br>00:04:40.080 problems that need to be you know kind  <br>00:04:41.960 of looked at I think yeah and it's and  <br>00:04:43.639 it's hard like from a a Linux novice now  <br>00:04:47.000 if you watch my channel like yeah I do  <br>00:04:49.440 uh home labbing stuff and I I am way  <br>00:04:52.600 more um comfortable with using Linux and  <br>00:04:56.960 the Enterprise level as a server  <br>00:04:59.199 obviously where it dominates the market  <br>00:05:01.120 but everyone knows the meme this is the  <br>00:05:03.240 year of the Linux desktop so that's a  <br>00:05:05.199 whole different ball game so yeah I went  <br>00:05:07.560 into it with that in mind and uh the  <br>00:05:11.039 biggest pain points I had were from uh  <br>00:05:15.240 hardware issues whether that be my insta  <br>00:05:18.280 360 webcam deciding to go in earthquake  <br>00:05:21.639 mode in the middle of a live stream wow  <br>00:05:24.400 um sounds like a feature but I don't I  <br>00:05:25.960 don't think it sounds useful it was cool  <br>00:05:28.120 but not what I wanted at the time but  <br>00:05:30.759 yeah I was on Tom Lawrence's stream and  <br>00:05:32.360 it just decided to do that and it's that  <br>00:05:35.880 was a frustrating thing and also because  <br>00:05:37.919 the insta 360 software to control that  <br>00:05:41.360 webcam doesn't exist in Linux it's just  <br>00:05:44.120 you can't get it um that was one issue  <br>00:05:47.600 that was kind of annoying another one  <br>00:05:49.240 was I was having issues with my  <br>00:05:51.720 Thunderbolt dock I would just sometimes  <br>00:05:54.600 decide that yeah we're not going to  <br>00:05:56.120 detect monitors and it's hard to narrow  <br>00:06:00.120 down what is specifically a Linux  <br>00:06:03.039 problem versus what is a Dell problem  <br>00:06:06.280 versus what is a combination of Linux  <br>00:06:08.680 with Dell with uh Thunderbolt with the  <br>00:06:11.120 specific dock type thing and I know in  <br>00:06:14.599 your presentation you you talked about  <br>00:06:16.560 testing hardware and that's probably  <br>00:06:18.120 something I should have uh looked at  <br>00:06:20.479 before doing this and I think that's a  <br>00:06:21.880 valid point because I think I was  <br>00:06:23.520 telling you I when I started this I  <br>00:06:26.039 wanted a laptop and I almost went with a  <br>00:06:28.000 system 76 one which is famously known  <br>00:06:31.280 for you run window or you run Linux on  <br>00:06:33.919 those I was like ah you know for the  <br>00:06:36.039 price I can get a used D  <br>00:06:38.560 xps15 um with you know better specs and  <br>00:06:42.240 so I got that and you know I read a  <br>00:06:43.639 couple of forum posts that it was it  <br>00:06:45.120 worked well with Linux and it was just  <br>00:06:47.360 so many issues and then the second one  <br>00:06:49.199 came down to software like I am heavily  <br>00:06:52.960 reliant on Photoshop and Lightroom  <br>00:06:56.160 Lightroom is one of the main ones that I  <br>00:06:57.639 won't budge on and and when I needed  <br>00:07:00.800 access to some of those pictures that  <br>00:07:03.400 were edited in Lightroom right I did not  <br>00:07:06.440 have them so these are just like a  <br>00:07:09.840 couple of things that just just kept  <br>00:07:12.240 eating at me until you know you got to  <br>00:07:15.680 get work done yeah and so you have to  <br>00:07:17.440 get stuff done and it just boiled over  <br>00:07:20.919 yeah I think so so one of my opinions  <br>00:07:23.840 and and less so with your presentation  <br>00:07:26.039 cuz I think for you it was like  <br>00:07:27.840 switching your workflow over and  <br>00:07:29.039 everything which is  <br>00:07:30.039 kind of how it goes but sometimes when  <br>00:07:33.280 you when people compare the situation  <br>00:07:34.879 with Linux and windows I don't always  <br>00:07:36.240 think it's quite the same comparison for  <br>00:07:38.240 example if you bought an HP laptop that  <br>00:07:41.280 runs windows then in their R&D lab they  <br>00:07:44.520 have made sure that each and every  <br>00:07:46.319 component works and I did Windows  <br>00:07:48.599 Administration for a long time uh one of  <br>00:07:50.639 the things I like to do back then was I  <br>00:07:52.800 would just wipe the manufacturer image  <br>00:07:54.560 from the drive cuz they'd have all this  <br>00:07:55.919 bloatware like you know inkjet ads or  <br>00:07:59.039 whatever it is that are on there so I  <br>00:08:00.720 just put put on the Microsoft image and  <br>00:08:03.879 when I do this I have like five or 10  <br>00:08:07.039 drivers to find but that wasn't that's  <br>00:08:09.319 not a problem because that's just the  <br>00:08:10.919 industry that okay fine I just install  <br>00:08:12.639 the drivers and it's good but when you  <br>00:08:14.919 have HP doing that they put the drivers  <br>00:08:17.680 on and they tested the audio card they  <br>00:08:20.400 tested the Wi-Fi card for Windows and  <br>00:08:24.159 one issue is when we come behind them  <br>00:08:27.440 and then we put Linux on it we become  <br>00:08:30.599 the R&D for Linux at that point because  <br>00:08:33.159 HP decided not to do that and sure they  <br>00:08:35.479 did have a Linux laptop recently that  <br>00:08:37.159 was a really good one but um I think  <br>00:08:40.719 sometimes the experiment can be  <br>00:08:42.320 different if you you know have a Windows  <br>00:08:46.360 laptop that's shipped with Windows and  <br>00:08:48.240 you have a laptop that's shipped with  <br>00:08:49.720 Linux now you're not guaranteed to have  <br>00:08:51.600 a perfect experience cuz if the  <br>00:08:53.080 manufacturer did a poor job you're still  <br>00:08:55.279 run into the same problem but it it's  <br>00:08:58.399 kind of like I feel like Linux is  <br>00:09:00.920 marketed as the everything OS too much  <br>00:09:03.360 where people say oh it runs on  <br>00:09:04.640 everything you should install it and  <br>00:09:06.120 they brag it up and I love it but I feel  <br>00:09:08.399 like they're bragging it too much and  <br>00:09:09.920 they're kind of setting people up for  <br>00:09:11.360 this expectation that may not align to  <br>00:09:13.440 reality yeah um one thing uh I I found  <br>00:09:18.360 out when doing this and I'd be curious  <br>00:09:21.560 to know how true you think this is is  <br>00:09:24.360 that I found when asking for help or  <br>00:09:27.440 trying to get general advice on some the  <br>00:09:29.560 issues I was having um whether they'd be  <br>00:09:33.200 like simple things like U mounting  <br>00:09:35.600 Network shares like I I just want to do  <br>00:09:37.600 that in the gooey like I can do in  <br>00:09:38.839 Windows and it's almost like overly  <br>00:09:41.480 complicated to do it and when I asked  <br>00:09:44.640 for that I was almost like made fun of  <br>00:09:46.920 because I wanted it in the goey and it  <br>00:09:48.880 was like the Linux I want to say the  <br>00:09:51.120 Linux Community cuz that's such a  <br>00:09:52.839 stereotype but certain users in the  <br>00:09:55.040 Linux Community almost fetishize making  <br>00:09:58.839 things different  <br>00:10:00.240 like they take pride in how difficult  <br>00:10:02.519 something is to do and if you want to  <br>00:10:03.920 make it easier it's almost like oh  <br>00:10:06.519 you're not built for Linux then buddy  <br>00:10:08.360 you better go back to to Windows do you  <br>00:10:11.680 see that I do there's so much toxicity  <br>00:10:15.160 in the Linux community and I don't want  <br>00:10:16.720 to make it out to be that every  <br>00:10:18.040 community that serves a Linux  <br>00:10:19.800 distribution is bad I don't want to say  <br>00:10:21.480 that at all but there are some out there  <br>00:10:23.360 I won't disparage them and name them but  <br>00:10:25.760 what I find is that you have helpful  <br>00:10:28.279 communities you have have toxic  <br>00:10:29.920 communities and for an example in my  <br>00:10:32.880 forums an rtfm response is a banable  <br>00:10:37.200 that's banable you are not allowed to  <br>00:10:38.880 say that on my forums because my mindset  <br>00:10:41.360 is either answer the person's question  <br>00:10:43.839 or don't right you know CU I get upset  <br>00:10:46.800 when someone gets you know rtfm like you  <br>00:10:48.959 didn't have to respond because number  <br>00:10:51.839 one you're going to trigger their  <br>00:10:53.920 opposition which is not going to get  <br>00:10:55.800 them to comply they are not going to  <br>00:10:57.680 search like you're telling them to  <br>00:10:59.320 they're not going to check the manual  <br>00:11:00.760 like you're telling them to you've  <br>00:11:02.519 pissed them off that's the only thing  <br>00:11:04.079 that you've you've done and we need to  <br>00:11:05.800 and I understand that it sometimes is so  <br>00:11:08.680 annoying to answer the same questions  <br>00:11:10.480 over and over and over again but that's  <br>00:11:12.279 what we have to do and we have to do it  <br>00:11:14.839 with a smile on her face and anything  <br>00:11:16.959 else is doing a disservice say like why  <br>00:11:19.000 are you on a forum then if you're not  <br>00:11:20.360 there to answer questions like it's yeah  <br>00:11:23.040 it's like it's like this and and the  <br>00:11:24.760 thing is if you want to help out in a  <br>00:11:26.160 community answering questions in the  <br>00:11:28.120 Forum is not the only thing you can do  <br>00:11:29.839 so if that's something that's rubbing  <br>00:11:31.040 you the wrong way maybe you feel like  <br>00:11:32.360 it's aggravating you or something and  <br>00:11:34.160 you might give a response like that you  <br>00:11:35.880 could maybe take a break from it and go  <br>00:11:37.480 help somewhere else behind closed doors  <br>00:11:39.519 maybe documentation if you're a coder  <br>00:11:41.320 maybe you could do that so I just don't  <br>00:11:43.480 get why people are are snarky like that  <br>00:11:46.519 when why are you there yeah and it's  <br>00:11:48.959 it's I I've seen it before and I've been  <br>00:11:50.839 on both sides and and I get it that's  <br>00:11:53.639 some questions are frustrating to answer  <br>00:11:56.000 over and over and some may seem you know  <br>00:11:58.720 really simple but from the other  <br>00:12:00.680 person's perspective you don't know how  <br>00:12:02.279 much courage it took them to walk into  <br>00:12:04.920 that forum and know that they are going  <br>00:12:06.399 to sound dumb asking a basic question  <br>00:12:09.519 right and I know some people some people  <br>00:12:11.120 are just annoying some people come in  <br>00:12:12.600 and refuse to get the help that they  <br>00:12:14.880 need and it's just at some point you  <br>00:12:16.920 know if you have to walk away and say  <br>00:12:18.720 sorry I can't help like that's fine like  <br>00:12:21.800 some people are just like that we get  <br>00:12:23.600 that but yeah saying read read the  <br>00:12:26.600 manual like that that's frust in and  <br>00:12:30.000 very discouraging and you only get one  <br>00:12:32.000 opportunity to make a first impression  <br>00:12:34.000 true so if someone's coming in here and  <br>00:12:35.440 trying Linux for the first time or  <br>00:12:36.760 you're distro for the first time and  <br>00:12:38.160 that's the response they get you think  <br>00:12:40.480 they're ever going to come back and no  <br>00:12:42.240 and and we are the marketing firm for  <br>00:12:44.519 Linux I need everyone to understand this  <br>00:12:46.480 like there's no one company yes there's  <br>00:12:48.880 big companies behind distributions but  <br>00:12:51.560 there's no Microsoft that owns  <br>00:12:54.040 everything and makes all the rules it's  <br>00:12:55.680 a community project we celebrate the  <br>00:12:58.560 fact that there's all this all these  <br>00:13:00.079 different um different you know  <br>00:13:01.600 distributions we celebrate the choice  <br>00:13:03.760 but then we flame people for using the  <br>00:13:06.920 choice like we say oh Linux is great  <br>00:13:08.839 because we have a bunch of distributions  <br>00:13:10.959 but then when they go to post a message  <br>00:13:12.360 why are you using that distribution  <br>00:13:13.800 you're stupid you should be using that  <br>00:13:15.040 distribution so at one point we're we're  <br>00:13:17.040 bragging about all the choice with Linux  <br>00:13:21.240 and when people exercise that choice  <br>00:13:23.440 then you know some people kind of don't  <br>00:13:25.120 don't seem to like that very much yeah  <br>00:13:26.959 and I one comment I got a lot on my  <br>00:13:28.880 video video  <br>00:13:30.560 was uh the Dr chose it doesn't matter  <br>00:13:33.120 what you chose the dro doesn't matter  <br>00:13:35.320 and I feel like to an extent that's kind  <br>00:13:37.639 of true but also not true it it's going  <br>00:13:41.360 to a point where the distribution won't  <br>00:13:42.959 matter at some point in the future we're  <br>00:13:44.920 not there yet it it's possible that the  <br>00:13:47.000 distribution doesn't matter for a  <br>00:13:48.360 particular person for example if their  <br>00:13:51.279 apps all just so happen to be within  <br>00:13:53.440 flathub they're good right they it  <br>00:13:55.920 doesn't matter what distribution they're  <br>00:13:57.199 on at that point they can install their  <br>00:13:58.720 favorite applications but if one of  <br>00:14:00.199 their favorite applications is not there  <br>00:14:02.560 then they have to go get it a different  <br>00:14:04.040 way so we have the Frameworks and we  <br>00:14:05.800 have flat pack we have wh and all these  <br>00:14:07.519 different things that are really going  <br>00:14:09.120 to make things better but they're not  <br>00:14:12.079 being developed fast enough and I'm not  <br>00:14:14.680 going to disparage the programmers here  <br>00:14:16.800 because I don't really think it's their  <br>00:14:18.040 fault what I feel like is you have  <br>00:14:19.759 system D Wayland flat pack snap insert  <br>00:14:23.839 name of thing here you know people are  <br>00:14:26.079 really passionate about developing this  <br>00:14:28.480 and they think that they're doing a  <br>00:14:29.639 great thing I think they're doing a  <br>00:14:30.800 great thing and then when they release  <br>00:14:32.440 it people are like I hate snaps I hate  <br>00:14:34.959 flat packs I hate system D I hate  <br>00:14:36.920 Wayland And that's think about it like  <br>00:14:38.759 this you get a a developer that's  <br>00:14:40.639 excited and their spirits and they're  <br>00:14:42.720 going to get discouraged so here we are  <br>00:14:44.480 expecting these Technologies to grow  <br>00:14:47.279 faster so it can get us there but what  <br>00:14:49.440 we're doing is we're just slamming the  <br>00:14:52.680 Developers for their decisions to a  <br>00:14:54.480 toxic level there I mean some have  <br>00:14:56.839 received death threats in the past I  <br>00:14:58.560 mean it gets to be a point where if I  <br>00:15:01.079 don't know if it were me and I was one  <br>00:15:02.959 of those developers I don't think I  <br>00:15:04.839 would write code as fast because I  <br>00:15:07.000 wouldn't be as excited to do it knowing  <br>00:15:09.079 that once I'm finished people are still  <br>00:15:11.440 going to be upset with me and I feel  <br>00:15:13.000 like that really slows things down a lot  <br>00:15:15.279 yeah it's that and it's also I think we  <br>00:15:17.279 discussed it in in one of our meetings  <br>00:15:19.440 um we might discussed it multiple times  <br>00:15:21.320 was um releasing things before they're  <br>00:15:24.880 ready because it goes back to you only  <br>00:15:27.000 get one first impression like right want  <br>00:15:29.160 this feature uh okay uh let's develop it  <br>00:15:32.519 crank it out there oh wait it doesn't  <br>00:15:34.639 actually work that well and now that  <br>00:15:37.240 feature is just known as being buggy and  <br>00:15:40.440 crap reputation is everything reputation  <br>00:15:42.959 especially when you have all these  <br>00:15:44.959 different dros in  <br>00:15:47.519 Windows you can get a bad reputation for  <br>00:15:49.920 a certain feature but it doesn't matter  <br>00:15:51.639 because you're still going to use  <br>00:15:52.560 Windows like that's that's what happens  <br>00:15:55.680 if you use Windows and you're used to it  <br>00:15:57.319 you're used to having these things  <br>00:15:58.560 happen but it doesn't matter cuz what  <br>00:16:00.000 else are you going to do in lenux if a  <br>00:16:03.480 drro that is promising that is making  <br>00:16:06.199 advances  <br>00:16:07.319 but they just for some reason or another  <br>00:16:09.920 whether that's self-inflicted or from  <br>00:16:11.600 some other means gets a negative  <br>00:16:13.639 reputation right people are just going  <br>00:16:15.600 to hop to a different one and that  <br>00:16:17.440 that's right I mean we look at a long  <br>00:16:19.639 time ago I mean I was a fan of KD for  <br>00:16:21.560 for a long time I still am even though  <br>00:16:23.160 it's not my daily driver I still like it  <br>00:16:24.480 a lot um but there was a point where I  <br>00:16:26.360 was using it full-time and I remember  <br>00:16:28.199 when KD for 4.0 came out it was  <br>00:16:30.839 extremely buggy you could barely keep it  <br>00:16:33.000 running um almost nothing worked well  <br>00:16:36.000 and then you know it's a 4.0 release  <br>00:16:38.399 it's considered stable and then the KD  <br>00:16:41.319 is like well you're not supposed to use  <br>00:16:42.759 it yet wait till like I forgot what  <br>00:16:44.600 version I'm like well you released it as  <br>00:16:47.160 stable so I'm I don't care if you're not  <br>00:16:49.240 feature complete but if you're crashing  <br>00:16:51.319 I have a problem and this is everyone's  <br>00:16:53.920 workflow now obviously I feel like KDE  <br>00:16:56.399 is great now I mean I'm sure they  <br>00:16:57.839 learned their lesson I have heard very  <br>00:16:59.319 many complaints lately but there's still  <br>00:17:01.399 people out there that might still feel  <br>00:17:03.279 that's the case there's people that  <br>00:17:04.520 think Ubuntu still has the Amazon icon  <br>00:17:08.520 and that that it's spying on them which  <br>00:17:10.280 wasn't true but they took that away a  <br>00:17:11.720 long time ago but people would swear  <br>00:17:13.679 it's still there it's like the once a  <br>00:17:15.720 software project in the Linux Community  <br>00:17:17.480 gets a bad reputation it's extremely  <br>00:17:20.000 hard for them to get rid of that and you  <br>00:17:22.359 see that with butter FS when they  <br>00:17:24.439 released 1.0 which was not feature  <br>00:17:27.160 complete now butter s probably won't  <br>00:17:30.000 have a single chance of taking over ZFS  <br>00:17:32.200 I think it's a great technology I'm not  <br>00:17:33.559 saying it's bad but but yeah it's it's  <br>00:17:35.960 wonderful but now that we called it 1.0  <br>00:17:38.760 it's got this reputation of the ZFS file  <br>00:17:41.320 system that barely works when all they  <br>00:17:44.559 did was call it 1.0 and I feel like once  <br>00:17:47.200 that happened development of butter FS  <br>00:17:49.600 slows down and the only thing I could  <br>00:17:51.760 think of is that it discourages people  <br>00:17:53.480 to hear all that backlash so one example  <br>00:17:55.880 I have right now is not specifically a  <br>00:17:57.240 Linux drro but that conversation  <br>00:17:59.320 reminded me of um I don't know who  <br>00:18:02.159 watching is um familiar with uh ice ice  <br>00:18:06.799 whale the zema board zema blade um zma  <br>00:18:10.240 Cube those zema products um wow yeah I'm  <br>00:18:12.960 not but I want to be at some point  <br>00:18:14.799 they're uh they're little like um sbcs  <br>00:18:18.240 or x86 they make a Zemo board and a zema  <br>00:18:20.760 blade they're like these little x86 like  <br>00:18:22.960 a Raspberry Pi that can boot from a flat  <br>00:18:24.720 from a USB key basically yeah it's just  <br>00:18:26.600 a little x86 N1 100 board and now they  <br>00:18:29.640 have a  <br>00:18:30.760 um they have a zma cube and it's a big  <br>00:18:33.480 nest it's like your sonology or qap it's  <br>00:18:37.039 just a and they developed their own uh  <br>00:18:39.600 little operating system for it called  <br>00:18:41.200 zma OS and they've been developing it  <br>00:18:44.159 for over a year but they've never  <br>00:18:46.760 released it as a 1.0 and I'm in the  <br>00:18:50.640 middle of reviewing one right now and it  <br>00:18:54.679 has a lot of issues but it's also not  <br>00:18:57.480 right a 1.0 so can't sit here and say  <br>00:19:00.080 you know this is bad like I mean I can  <br>00:19:02.600 say I can point out all the flaws  <br>00:19:04.240 definitely point but I can't say like  <br>00:19:06.520 guys this isn't a released product when  <br>00:19:08.640 it's released then I can give my final  <br>00:19:11.440 judgment on it as a whole and I feel  <br>00:19:13.919 like if more dros did that or with their  <br>00:19:16.280 features at least like this is ready  <br>00:19:18.520 this is stable we marked it as stable if  <br>00:19:20.640 you want another feature look at our  <br>00:19:22.400 road map we are working on it but I feel  <br>00:19:25.200 like that's not the case I think we need  <br>00:19:27.240 to have more people from a drro agnostic  <br>00:19:31.720 perspective catalog the hardware and the  <br>00:19:34.559 compatibility to have a drro agnostic  <br>00:19:37.000 compatibility database I'm not saying  <br>00:19:39.080 that that doesn't exist already I'm  <br>00:19:40.679 pretty sure that it does but we need  <br>00:19:43.559 something that is you know paid  <br>00:19:46.159 attention to that's being developed that  <br>00:19:48.679 is you know moving forward if we just  <br>00:19:50.919 had the one place that people could  <br>00:19:52.240 check then you know maybe you'll type in  <br>00:19:54.679 your Nvidia card and it might say works  <br>00:19:56.640 with a vuntu 2404 doesn't work with  <br>00:19:59.120 20204 and then it has that but one issue  <br>00:20:03.000 is we have all these distributions  <br>00:20:04.520 developing separately and that's not  <br>00:20:05.880 really a problem because they should be  <br>00:20:07.200 able to do that the whole point is to  <br>00:20:08.320 have a distribution of your own but  <br>00:20:10.280 they're also solving problems  <br>00:20:12.480 independently that they could help other  <br>00:20:14.440 distribution solve things that you know  <br>00:20:16.880 if if you're going through an issue with  <br>00:20:18.360 your dock on your  <br>00:20:20.480 distribution um if your distribution  <br>00:20:22.440 fixes it maybe they'll let another  <br>00:20:23.840 distribution know what they had to do to  <br>00:20:25.200 get that done and then the next thing  <br>00:20:26.480 you know if they Upstream it if it's a  <br>00:20:27.919 Linux kernel ISS you then it goes there  <br>00:20:29.400 everyone benefits but who's doing this  <br>00:20:32.960 you know like like we need we need  <br>00:20:34.440 someone like obviously we're expecting  <br>00:20:36.159 users to do it but they're not doing it  <br>00:20:38.039 yeah I think it's like a double-edged  <br>00:20:39.559 sword with Linux being so customizable  <br>00:20:43.320 and the fact that there's so many to  <br>00:20:44.440 choose from that's a good thing but on  <br>00:20:46.960 the other side you're splitting your  <br>00:20:50.840 developers and your talent into all  <br>00:20:54.600 these different pieces when imagine if  <br>00:20:56.679 you I know this isn't going to happen  <br>00:20:58.240 cuz it's not the nature of Linux or or  <br>00:21:01.159 open source but imagine if you just took  <br>00:21:02.799 those people and had a standardize one  <br>00:21:04.159 drro we're going to work together on  <br>00:21:05.919 just this one and we're going to make  <br>00:21:07.480 Linux yeah good for this one drro in a  <br>00:21:12.039 perfect world yeah that'd be great but  <br>00:21:14.039 that's not going to happen because the  <br>00:21:16.440 the reason people get into Linux is  <br>00:21:17.919 because they don't want to be forced  <br>00:21:19.279 into right a bucket they want that that  <br>00:21:22.159 freedom and and that was a big part of  <br>00:21:24.360 the you know the conversation here at 45  <br>00:21:26.520 drives we we talk about things like even  <br>00:21:28.919 during one of the meetings um PowerPoint  <br>00:21:31.840 froze for someone multiple times they  <br>00:21:35.039 we've had a update didn't we have an  <br>00:21:36.799 update window come up I could have sworn  <br>00:21:38.120 we did we had some kind of message come  <br>00:21:39.400 up a few different times and it was  <br>00:21:41.840 funny we were talking about how Windows  <br>00:21:45.120 is disruptive often to the users while  <br>00:21:48.159 it was actually showing disruption  <br>00:21:50.080 toward us while we were talking but  <br>00:21:52.919 that's kind of the main point that we  <br>00:21:54.240 get to when we say d Microsoft and  <br>00:21:56.480 personally my opinion is everyone should  <br>00:21:58.799 use the operating system that that works  <br>00:22:00.760 for them I want a future where someone  <br>00:22:04.360 goes to Best Buy and they see a Windows  <br>00:22:07.080 laptop they see a Macbook and they see a  <br>00:22:09.679 Linux laptop I want them to have a hard  <br>00:22:12.120 choice I want them to be there for a  <br>00:22:13.679 while and really have a hard decision  <br>00:22:15.720 because all three are just that good but  <br>00:22:18.320 the reality is um sometimes it's just  <br>00:22:22.000 hard to push something forward when  <br>00:22:25.240 other distrib all the distributions are  <br>00:22:27.080 each going their own Direction I feel  <br>00:22:28.600 that makes it tougher a lot yeah and  <br>00:22:30.640 it's I think we discussed this that was  <br>00:22:34.679 like we're it I think we were kind of  <br>00:22:37.240 split on this one where um feeling about  <br>00:22:41.080 the end user how much are they actually  <br>00:22:43.799 tied to Windows and we were like I don't  <br>00:22:46.320 think the end user really cares too much  <br>00:22:48.760 about the operating system as long as  <br>00:22:50.200 they're guaranteed that it'll work and  <br>00:22:52.520 and Linux hasn't proven that it'll just  <br>00:22:55.279 work because the connotation behind it  <br>00:22:57.720 is that it's weird because it's it's  <br>00:23:00.400 both it'll work on everything which I  <br>00:23:02.559 know isn't true but it has that kind of  <br>00:23:04.720 people say that people say that but and  <br>00:23:07.880 it doesn't work so it's got both this  <br>00:23:10.279 it'll work on everything but it doesn't  <br>00:23:12.240 work and it's it's so confusing that the  <br>00:23:15.200 average person they're never going to  <br>00:23:17.640 they're never going to use that over Mac  <br>00:23:20.320 or Windows if if that is the perception  <br>00:23:23.679 so and it wasn't a very popular opinion  <br>00:23:26.960 but I still stand by it that people  <br>00:23:29.000 don't like change you know if someone  <br>00:23:31.760 switches to Linux or even for just a  <br>00:23:34.279 little while because you maybe because  <br>00:23:35.760 you recommended it there's a very good  <br>00:23:38.159 chance that they're doing it because  <br>00:23:39.240 they love you they're doing it because  <br>00:23:40.559 they're supporting you they're they're  <br>00:23:42.200 helping you they're being a team player  <br>00:23:44.320 but changing an operating system is just  <br>00:23:47.480 not a mindset anyone has when they go to  <br>00:23:50.159 an appliance store they buy a fridge  <br>00:23:51.919 they don't care what's inside the fridge  <br>00:23:55.080 they just want their soda to be cold  <br>00:23:56.760 that's all they care about right so  <br>00:23:59.120 imagine if we go up to somebody and say  <br>00:24:01.120 Hey I want to change the operating  <br>00:24:02.480 system on your fridge it's going to cool  <br>00:24:04.039 your food better what um and I know  <br>00:24:06.440 that's a stupid example but if you think  <br>00:24:08.120 about it when you have a person they buy  <br>00:24:10.400 a computer it's an appliance they think  <br>00:24:12.279 of it like they're buying a stove a  <br>00:24:14.480 refrigerator a dishwasher they're buying  <br>00:24:16.360 a thing that does a thing and and that's  <br>00:24:18.960 all it is to them we come in change the  <br>00:24:21.320 operating system many of these people  <br>00:24:22.799 didn't even know that was something that  <br>00:24:24.000 you could do in the first place and  <br>00:24:26.520 they're going to feel anxiety when you  <br>00:24:28.440 recommend this because what you're  <br>00:24:29.960 telling them is I would love for an  <br>00:24:32.440 opportunity you know an opportunity to  <br>00:24:34.440 change the way you do everything  <br>00:24:35.919 wouldn't that be so cool yeah and then  <br>00:24:38.480 and then they don't want to get on board  <br>00:24:39.720 with it but um my opinion on Linux is  <br>00:24:43.240 that Linux on the desktop will only take  <br>00:24:45.919 off when a flagship desktop not marketed  <br>00:24:49.880 as a Linux desktop but does have Linux  <br>00:24:52.559 installed takes off then that would be  <br>00:24:55.720 something that could happen but it's  <br>00:24:57.799 just I mean look at Chrome OS like right  <br>00:25:00.880 Linux bace it doesn't say Android yeah  <br>00:25:03.600 yeah it's not Linux Android it's not  <br>00:25:06.039 Linux Chrome OS but it is popular people  <br>00:25:10.240 like it I wonder how how many people you  <br>00:25:12.279 think actually know that when they're  <br>00:25:14.000 using their Chromebook or their Android  <br>00:25:15.880 that it's based on Linux what percentage  <br>00:25:17.880 of people I mean I leg don't know I mean  <br>00:25:20.640 I really don't know but I I can't  <br>00:25:22.399 imagine that many people know or even  <br>00:25:24.039 care to know yeah so imagine yeah like  <br>00:25:25.840 you said if there's this third operating  <br>00:25:27.480 system that comes out out that looks as  <br>00:25:30.480 good as Mac OS and it has the  <br>00:25:32.600 compatibility of things with  <br>00:25:34.919 Windows people would be like okay I mean  <br>00:25:37.960 not overnight well I disagree I mean I I  <br>00:25:40.640 see your point but I feel like people  <br>00:25:43.039 will never switch to Windows I mean to  <br>00:25:45.320 Linux because they they're people are  <br>00:25:47.880 that averse to change it's really hard  <br>00:25:49.240 for us to understand this because we get  <br>00:25:51.880 excited when new technology comes out  <br>00:25:53.559 because there's new features there new  <br>00:25:54.919 technologies and things to learn but  <br>00:25:56.840 they don't get excited about those  <br>00:25:58.080 things things and I just feel like we're  <br>00:26:01.039 pitching something to a market see apple  <br>00:26:04.480 ships everything as you know I hate to  <br>00:26:06.120 use them as as an example but they  <br>00:26:08.279 they're very good at selling things  <br>00:26:10.080 they're extremely good at this and in  <br>00:26:11.840 marketing um how many times have you  <br>00:26:13.919 seen them Market oh check out our new  <br>00:26:16.039 version of  <br>00:26:17.399 BSD so many times right it's every  <br>00:26:20.200 commercial oh BSD o right no it's Mac OS  <br>00:26:23.480 they're selling a Mac computer with Mac  <br>00:26:26.559 OS and it it does well because they're  <br>00:26:29.360 selling a product meanwhile I feel like  <br>00:26:32.080 we're trying to sell an idea to people  <br>00:26:34.679 we should be selling a product yeah and  <br>00:26:36.679 I think it it's going to boil down to  <br>00:26:38.679 and this is getting further in yeah into  <br>00:26:40.960 the discussion but like you're used to  <br>00:26:44.720 like I said you're not you don't want to  <br>00:26:45.720 change so you're going to use what  <br>00:26:46.840 you're used to so how do we get the  <br>00:26:48.880 younger generation more used to using  <br>00:26:51.919 Linux if that's what we want to succeed  <br>00:26:54.840 moving forward if that's how we want  <br>00:26:56.600 Linux to gain more users but I feel like  <br>00:26:59.960 what's popular these days is you know  <br>00:27:03.279 this what you have in your pocket this  <br>00:27:04.760 is what people use as their main device  <br>00:27:08.600 so Y which I don't know is if that hurts  <br>00:27:11.880 or helps because I feel like when I was  <br>00:27:14.760 growing up we didn't have this if you  <br>00:27:17.360 wanted technology you got on the  <br>00:27:18.799 computer or went to the library cuz you  <br>00:27:20.799 couldn't afford it yeah and now it's  <br>00:27:22.640 like there's this distinct separation  <br>00:27:24.919 between my computer and my phone I may  <br>00:27:27.679 do more stuff on my phone but when I  <br>00:27:29.000 want to do something I get on the  <br>00:27:30.480 computer and now it's like well you know  <br>00:27:32.760 this is my phone and that's my computer  <br>00:27:34.399 if that's a Linux one then sure but I do  <br>00:27:36.840 most of my stuff here so I think one  <br>00:27:40.320 it's going to be a weird Next Generation  <br>00:27:43.679 10 20 years that's for sure I I can  <br>00:27:46.880 Envision someday the desktop completely  <br>00:27:49.799 dying and laptops being the only thing  <br>00:27:51.799 now now when I say this I want to be  <br>00:27:53.039 clear I do not see gaming PCs dying okay  <br>00:27:55.919 when I'm talking about desktops dying I  <br>00:27:57.640 mean for the people that don't game like  <br>00:27:59.279 the people that you know are are working  <br>00:28:00.880 in an office or you know their computers  <br>00:28:03.240 in Appliance they don't care people will  <br>00:28:04.559 still be building computers and buying  <br>00:28:05.919 video cards but I I do feel like at a  <br>00:28:07.720 certain point other than that the  <br>00:28:10.480 desktop is going to die and then as the  <br>00:28:12.760 portable devices which run Linux easier  <br>00:28:15.320 There's an opportunity there for Linux  <br>00:28:17.120 to come up with another device the  <br>00:28:18.679 desktop has already been one for so long  <br>00:28:20.559 it's really hard to to go back  <br>00:28:22.440 retroactively and win it this time but  <br>00:28:24.120 if you know we saw with netbooks Linux  <br>00:28:26.120 was there at the beginning and at that  <br>00:28:27.720 point a lot of people don't realize this  <br>00:28:29.320 a lot of people had a Linux laptop what  <br>00:28:32.559 happened tablets tablets came out  <br>00:28:35.640 everyone thought netbooks were going to  <br>00:28:36.919 be the thing it looked like Linux was  <br>00:28:38.880 actually taking off and next thing you  <br>00:28:40.840 know you know we have Android tablets  <br>00:28:42.720 that just we switched to that we  <br>00:28:44.240 switched to the the iPad and netbooks  <br>00:28:46.600 Fade Into Obscurity but what we saw was  <br>00:28:49.120 a new device form factor coming up Linux  <br>00:28:52.240 being there first and gaining from that  <br>00:28:54.640 popularity I think that's what we need  <br>00:28:56.559 this time yeah good example that we're  <br>00:28:58.240 seeing right now is the steam deck M  <br>00:29:01.039 valve gave the customers a feature and a  <br>00:29:06.080 reason to buy a product and the  <br>00:29:08.480 operating system was secondary you're  <br>00:29:10.519 buying this to game you don't care how  <br>00:29:14.880 it does it but it's running Linux so you  <br>00:29:18.919 know everyone's seen that spike in the  <br>00:29:21.320 amount of users using Linux just through  <br>00:29:23.480 Steam deck sales because of how popular  <br>00:29:25.440 it's gotten and I think if you can  <br>00:29:29.080 do that in a  <br>00:29:30.799 more I don't even know I don't want to  <br>00:29:32.600 say corporate world but more just like  <br>00:29:34.600 gener generic end user world like this  <br>00:29:37.960 thing it's super easy to watch YouTube  <br>00:29:40.480 and browse your mail and that's  <br>00:29:42.320 something I guess you see with Chrome OS  <br>00:29:43.960 I guess that's the appeal to it and they  <br>00:29:45.360 don't care what it is like you you give  <br>00:29:48.159 someone something they don't care that's  <br>00:29:49.399 Chrome OS they don't care that's Mac OS  <br>00:29:51.320 it it works so until L Linux  <br>00:29:55.240 distribution can get there right that  <br>00:29:58.640 is that easy for the average user on  <br>00:30:02.640 various different hardware and is  <br>00:30:04.960 compatible right with different  <br>00:30:07.600 hardware and I  <br>00:30:09.720 mean I I don't know I think he hit the  <br>00:30:12.840 na on the head and you know I feel like  <br>00:30:15.240 it's so Val valuable for me to hear  <br>00:30:16.919 about these things because you know I've  <br>00:30:19.279 been using Linux for 22 years right so I  <br>00:30:22.000 want to hear what people are going  <br>00:30:23.840 through today I know what people were  <br>00:30:26.679 going through when I first learned about  <br>00:30:28.559 it I know what people are going through  <br>00:30:30.320 as I read the news and study the  <br>00:30:31.640 communities and look at what people are  <br>00:30:33.480 saying but that's never the same as  <br>00:30:35.399 hearing it straight from someone's mouth  <br>00:30:37.000 what was their personal experience it's  <br>00:30:40.159 their personal workflow they decided to  <br>00:30:42.799 give this a shot and then they have  <br>00:30:44.559 something to say about it and that  <br>00:30:45.799 feedback is valuable yeah I mean a lot  <br>00:30:47.679 of people don't want to because a lot of  <br>00:30:49.320 the  <br>00:30:50.080 times if you Tred links and you failed  <br>00:30:53.159 you don't want to admit cuz you know you  <br>00:30:54.840 seem dumb like it's it's almost like oh  <br>00:30:57.000 I failed this thing I must have done  <br>00:30:58.200 something wrong I don't want to go share  <br>00:31:00.039 that with a bunch of people and some  <br>00:31:01.159 people do obviously there's people out  <br>00:31:02.600 there that are saying oh you know I had  <br>00:31:04.440 this issue you know why did I fail but a  <br>00:31:06.559 lot of people don't like they just like  <br>00:31:08.799 you said put in a live CD mess around  <br>00:31:11.799 with it it didn't work for me or  <br>00:31:13.440 something broke unplug it never try  <br>00:31:15.399 again never tell anybody like it just  <br>00:31:16.880 sucks if someone asks you oh did you  <br>00:31:19.000 ever try Linux yeah I tried it once it  <br>00:31:20.200 was terrible like that's but we also  <br>00:31:22.799 have to keep in mind too that sometimes  <br>00:31:25.240 the whole thing changes and is reversed  <br>00:31:27.559 when  <br>00:31:28.639 someone starts with a different  <br>00:31:30.399 operating system like like I knew  <br>00:31:32.200 somebody know somebody that started with  <br>00:31:35.200 Linux like you know when she's young she  <br>00:31:37.320 wants a computer whatever I have spare  <br>00:31:39.320 parts put it together put Linux on it um  <br>00:31:42.279 gave it to her seemed to like it a lot  <br>00:31:44.519 there was no problems because that's  <br>00:31:45.840 what she started with she never really  <br>00:31:47.200 had any issues she was not a computer  <br>00:31:48.919 person either like like she just learned  <br>00:31:50.720 how to do it and and that was that but  <br>00:31:53.159 she got frustrated one day when her  <br>00:31:55.480 friend asked her to help her uh put MP3  <br>00:31:58.240 is and an MP3 player it wasn't an iPod  <br>00:32:00.000 it wasn't Zoom it wasn't anything crazy  <br>00:32:01.679 it's just one of those that's a flash  <br>00:32:03.120 drive and it works on every operating  <br>00:32:05.080 system so it did work on Linux and  <br>00:32:07.320 windows so her friend has Windows and  <br>00:32:09.679 and I'm trying to walk her through it  <br>00:32:10.679 I'm like okay here's what you do you  <br>00:32:11.720 click on the start button you go to my  <br>00:32:13.559 computer and when you're inside there  <br>00:32:15.200 you should see like some kind of icon  <br>00:32:16.760 that represents your um your music  <br>00:32:18.840 player and and that's exactly what it  <br>00:32:20.799 was but she gets irate and she's like  <br>00:32:23.360 why did I have to click three times to  <br>00:32:27.159 go to my MP3 player this design is  <br>00:32:29.600 stupid and then she starts like making  <br>00:32:32.320 fun of my computer like who thought  <br>00:32:34.120 that's like I don't know but that's just  <br>00:32:36.039 the way it is and that's just and I  <br>00:32:37.880 don't really have an opinion here but  <br>00:32:39.919 what the reason I remembered this so  <br>00:32:41.399 well is because what I saw was somebody  <br>00:32:44.480 who didn't start with Windows or Mac and  <br>00:32:46.519 I got a chance to see what their what  <br>00:32:48.840 their world is like it when that's the  <br>00:32:50.760 only thing they have experienced with  <br>00:32:53.000 and and you get to see what their issues  <br>00:32:54.880 are with Windows um and I'm not going to  <br>00:32:58.440 say that's a very standard thing but I  <br>00:33:01.039 do feel too that the operating system  <br>00:33:04.080 you start with colors your mindset of  <br>00:33:06.720 computing to a point where it's really  <br>00:33:08.120 hard to change that later yeah that's  <br>00:33:09.720 hard cuz how often do you get the  <br>00:33:11.039 opportunity to talk to somebody whose  <br>00:33:12.880 first operating system was Linux not  <br>00:33:15.279 very often wasn't so yeah not like many  <br>00:33:18.919 people's was but I will say I guess if I  <br>00:33:21.559 had to offer two pieces two the two most  <br>00:33:25.760 important things I think are barriers  <br>00:33:28.519 for a lot of people getting into Linux  <br>00:33:30.519 and this is both from personal  <br>00:33:31.600 experience and from talking to people in  <br>00:33:33.000 my community is one is Hardware  <br>00:33:37.200 compatibility and I don't know how you  <br>00:33:39.760 solve that if there's some uh  <br>00:33:42.519 centralized database that has all these  <br>00:33:45.120 different combinations or if there's  <br>00:33:46.760 some type of Hardware compatibility  <br>00:33:49.200 check that you can there are yeah there  <br>00:33:50.880 there are already it's just that you  <br>00:33:52.360 know there's at least a few of these but  <br>00:33:53.960 they last I checked they they they  <br>00:33:55.519 didn't have the information I was  <br>00:33:56.639 looking for I feel like you know we need  <br>00:33:59.399 something new that that that's you know  <br>00:34:01.960 with some excitement around it some  <br>00:34:03.679 people that really want to help this out  <br>00:34:05.440 they are willing to have someone you  <br>00:34:07.519 know send in hardware for them to play  <br>00:34:09.599 with and then report back you get enough  <br>00:34:11.839 volunteers all over the world that are  <br>00:34:14.040 willing to do this and not just say it  <br>00:34:17.000 works and that's it no we don't want  <br>00:34:19.040 that we want like some details if it's a  <br>00:34:21.239 GPU did you try multiple screens what  <br>00:34:23.760 refresh rate did you get what what  <br>00:34:25.760 monitor you know what what resolution  <br>00:34:27.839 did you get and was that the native  <br>00:34:29.480 resolution of your display I mean  <br>00:34:31.359 there's other kind of things that we  <br>00:34:32.760 really do need to know and we need a we  <br>00:34:35.679 need something that's going to provide  <br>00:34:38.560 that to users that's third party has no  <br>00:34:40.960 distribution interest and it's just  <br>00:34:43.879 there for that um and that's just one  <br>00:34:45.800 way but I feel like we will solve this I  <br>00:34:49.520 I also feel like part of the reason why  <br>00:34:50.918 it's so challenging right now is Linux  <br>00:34:52.719 is in a state of transition in many  <br>00:34:55.079 different ways simultaneously the system  <br>00:34:58.720 the display manager Universal apps are  <br>00:35:01.960 being introduced along with  <br>00:35:03.640 containerization and immutable  <br>00:35:05.400 distributions this is all being  <br>00:35:07.400 introduced right now okay it's going to  <br>00:35:10.920 be a little there's going to be some  <br>00:35:12.520 some dirt in the room and some dust you  <br>00:35:14.280 know I think for a little while yeah and  <br>00:35:16.160 the the second thing I think is um just  <br>00:35:18.760 package management like it's when I go  <br>00:35:21.680 into a drro I shouldn't have to worry  <br>00:35:24.560 about if it's using snap or flat pack or  <br>00:35:27.880 if I need to go find the Deb on their  <br>00:35:30.400 website or if I have to load in the  <br>00:35:32.320 specific repository and use app to get  <br>00:35:34.640 it like there's so many different I  <br>00:35:36.680 don't know if you standardize it or if  <br>00:35:38.359 you make a proper UI for a package  <br>00:35:41.839 manager that isn't terrible like it's  <br>00:35:44.880 just so frustrating because in Windows  <br>00:35:46.599 it's pretty standard and Mac is pretty  <br>00:35:48.480 standard you download the app you run it  <br>00:35:50.800 it's installed here it's like even in  <br>00:35:53.599 you even when you do have stores and you  <br>00:35:57.640 search for something and even in in  <br>00:35:59.720 repos it's like wait which version why  <br>00:36:01.880 do I have I want to install Plex Media  <br>00:36:04.440 Server to run on my Debian um desktop  <br>00:36:08.200 just to try it out whatever I I I type  <br>00:36:11.000 in Plex there's like four different  <br>00:36:12.400 versions I'm like that's a that's a  <br>00:36:14.640 legit problem absolutely and I'm so glad  <br>00:36:17.040 you mentioned that that's that's  <br>00:36:18.200 absolutely true that's I think those are  <br>00:36:19.760 the two big ones that if you can solve  <br>00:36:22.160 those that is the two biggest hurdles I  <br>00:36:26.280 think a lot of new people to Linux face  <br>00:36:29.079 including myself because those are the  <br>00:36:31.920 main things you interact with your  <br>00:36:33.160 hardware and your software and if either  <br>00:36:36.079 one of those you have issues with it  <br>00:36:39.200 you're going to give up and that's what  <br>00:36:40.640 happened to me so have you by chance  <br>00:36:43.000 tried app Images along the way or has  <br>00:36:44.839 that crossed your radar I I I have I  <br>00:36:48.280 think that when I was running  <br>00:36:50.119 aontu is it used in it's used it's  <br>00:36:53.200 another so it's another there's three  <br>00:36:54.880 primary Universal package formats that  <br>00:36:57.000 are buying pred dominance we have flat  <br>00:36:58.880 pack snap and app Images app Images  <br>00:37:01.880 being a distant third but what I the  <br>00:37:03.319 reason I bring them up is because you  <br>00:37:05.560 know my opinion is mixed about them but  <br>00:37:07.040 what I do like about them is it's like  <br>00:37:09.760 the app or excuse me the Mac App  <br>00:37:12.760 mentality on Linux you download like on  <br>00:37:15.000 Linux you or Mac you download a app  <br>00:37:17.400 right you double click on it you can run  <br>00:37:18.920 it you can put it in any folder you want  <br>00:37:20.319 it doesn't matter double click on it you  <br>00:37:21.440 run it so an app image you it's aapp  <br>00:37:24.000 image file you double click on it it  <br>00:37:25.680 runs it has everything it needs you put  <br>00:37:27.319 it in any folder you want and you just  <br>00:37:29.119 run it from that folder and then you  <br>00:37:30.440 could do you know for example you could  <br>00:37:32.359 have your syncing solution like sync  <br>00:37:34.680 things sync your you know apps folder  <br>00:37:36.920 with all your flat pack or app Images  <br>00:37:39.000 update one and then your you know Google  <br>00:37:41.359 drive or whatever it is will get all the  <br>00:37:42.920 others updated but I like that solution  <br>00:37:46.319 because you know it does give you the  <br>00:37:48.319 ability to just download something and  <br>00:37:50.040 run it you don't worry about it um the  <br>00:37:52.800 problem is not everything's available  <br>00:37:54.319 that way and then there's no like then  <br>00:37:57.119 you got to go in and update them all mhm  <br>00:37:59.160 and then you run into the Mac situation  <br>00:38:00.880 that Mac users run into where you have  <br>00:38:02.599 to download something like mac updater  <br>00:38:04.400 because you have um on Mac you have the  <br>00:38:06.440 App Store there's updates in there  <br>00:38:08.319 system settings you have your your Mac  <br>00:38:10.000 OS updates in there individual apps will  <br>00:38:12.680 update themselves or maybe they won't  <br>00:38:14.560 but you're supposed to go in and find  <br>00:38:15.720 out if they didn't or not some so in in  <br>00:38:19.000 Mac you have a lot of issues but they're  <br>00:38:21.040 not nearly as bad as the Linux issues  <br>00:38:23.440 but even with Mac it's really cool that  <br>00:38:25.599 you have aapp file you run it you're  <br>00:38:27.720 fine and with app Images which I'll have  <br>00:38:30.079 a video out shortly we'll explain how to  <br>00:38:32.400 use them but I bring that up because  <br>00:38:34.960 people are trying to come up with  <br>00:38:36.359 Solutions but you know we're going to  <br>00:38:38.319 have to decide in the community you know  <br>00:38:40.160 which way are we going yeah and that's  <br>00:38:41.599 the hard part and I think like everyone  <br>00:38:44.400 loves like repos like it's so great in  <br>00:38:47.760 Linux like oh you want a software app  <br>00:38:49.680 install this boom you're done it's funny  <br>00:38:52.800 I hate repos it's an nonp popular  <br>00:38:54.560 opinion because when I first started  <br>00:38:56.480 Linux I I'll never forget this it was  <br>00:38:58.640 like the very first version of auntu  <br>00:39:01.839 ever and I was using um open Office on  <br>00:39:04.680 that and then you know I'm liking it so  <br>00:39:07.119 I go online and I I find the news that a  <br>00:39:09.359 new version of open office has just come  <br>00:39:11.000 out and I'm like well that's really cool  <br>00:39:12.520 because I want to check that out I  <br>00:39:13.760 really like that so I ask in the  <br>00:39:16.160 communities how do I get that how can I  <br>00:39:18.040 install that like it's available now  <br>00:39:19.680 like just wait for the next version of a  <br>00:39:21.240 BTU I'm like wait a minute you're  <br>00:39:23.560 telling me I have to wait for the next  <br>00:39:25.760 version M of my entire operating system  <br>00:39:29.359 to have the courtesy of upgrading open  <br>00:39:31.960 Office when Mac and windows users are  <br>00:39:35.480 able to go to the website and download  <br>00:39:37.240 it and and you know Libre office  <br>00:39:39.480 nowadays I mean and even back then they  <br>00:39:41.200 might have had another repository but  <br>00:39:42.599 that's not even the point the point is  <br>00:39:44.760 you're being provided a package in the  <br>00:39:46.520 repositories that may or may not have a  <br>00:39:48.800 third party P repository that's so up to  <br>00:39:50.760 date but the issue you run into like  <br>00:39:53.599 like Linux users I don't think we can  <br>00:39:55.720 tell Mac or Windows users they have to  <br>00:39:57.880 wait for the next version of their  <br>00:39:59.079 operating system for the next version of  <br>00:40:00.720 their software the straight phas and  <br>00:40:03.280 that's why I've always hated that my  <br>00:40:04.720 mentality has been your Linux kernel  <br>00:40:07.800 display drivers critical operating  <br>00:40:11.200 system components can be apt packages  <br>00:40:13.599 they could be RPMs and distribution  <br>00:40:15.400 repos all day long but once you get to  <br>00:40:17.160 the user layer we need user space apps  <br>00:40:20.119 out of the package management completely  <br>00:40:23.200 we should not have Apache in the same  <br>00:40:26.760 reposit atory as our Linux kernel we  <br>00:40:29.000 should be able to install Apache  <br>00:40:32.000 separately via Universal package that is  <br>00:40:35.079 independent of the package system and  <br>00:40:37.640 this is why we run into problems where  <br>00:40:39.160 someone pip installs something and then  <br>00:40:40.839 it blows away their package database and  <br>00:40:43.280 and then they want to continue to say  <br>00:40:44.760 that repositories are great I'm sorry I  <br>00:40:46.960 know a lot of people in my audience are  <br>00:40:48.520 going to disagree with me on this  <br>00:40:50.480 software repositories are not good in  <br>00:40:52.720 the way that they're being run today in  <br>00:40:54.440 my opinion yeah and that's inside that  <br>00:40:56.680 you know as a novice I have no I like  <br>00:40:59.280 that that's not something that crosses  <br>00:41:01.200 my mind I'm the end user that when I am  <br>00:41:04.480 so used to app install of this and then  <br>00:41:07.920 it's it is confusing cuz you know as the  <br>00:41:11.280 new person comes in you're like wait  <br>00:41:12.839 everyone's telling me to use app install  <br>00:41:14.520 to get this but there's a a package  <br>00:41:17.200 there's a store shouldn't I use that to  <br>00:41:19.520 install it right it's like no like but  <br>00:41:22.119 wait yes but what do I do it's it's very  <br>00:41:24.520 confusing so usually what I tell people  <br>00:41:26.240 going forward for now at least to try to  <br>00:41:27.839 make sense of this craziness is when you  <br>00:41:29.880 go into your app store or whatever you  <br>00:41:32.640 want to call it and you want to download  <br>00:41:34.920 something sometimes or at least a lot of  <br>00:41:36.960 times there's a drop- down it'll say Deb  <br>00:41:38.920 version flat pack version RPM version  <br>00:41:41.319 flat pack version whatever the case may  <br>00:41:42.800 be what I'll tell people now until we  <br>00:41:45.000 figure this out is just download the  <br>00:41:48.400 distribution package for now unless you  <br>00:41:52.280 need the newer version now one trick one  <br>00:41:55.160 tip I give everyone about Linux is you  <br>00:41:57.319 should never ever ever ever consider  <br>00:41:59.920 using the distribution version of Libre  <br>00:42:02.560 office that should be the first thing  <br>00:42:04.520 you install you should never open it you  <br>00:42:06.359 should never consider opening it you  <br>00:42:07.880 need to delete it and then after you do  <br>00:42:09.680 that you could get Libre office as a  <br>00:42:11.800 flat pack that is fully up to date now  <br>00:42:13.839 why am I asking you to remove this now  <br>00:42:15.760 here's the problem Libre office gets  <br>00:42:17.560 stigma people will say it's not as good  <br>00:42:19.720 as Microsoft Office and the reason why  <br>00:42:21.559 they say this I think at least in part  <br>00:42:24.359 is they have a very old version in their  <br>00:42:27.599 distributions repository that they have  <br>00:42:30.119 installed and since then lib office has  <br>00:42:32.520 been you know as they do they look for  <br>00:42:35.520 ways to reverse engineer what Microsoft  <br>00:42:37.440 is doing they fix things as they're  <br>00:42:39.079 broken they keep updating it and you  <br>00:42:41.559 need to be using a newer version of libr  <br>00:42:43.720 office to benefit from the continual  <br>00:42:45.680 fixes that they put into this but now  <br>00:42:48.240 because distributions are shipping this  <br>00:42:51.400 and they're shipping old versions I mean  <br>00:42:52.880 what version do we have in in Debian  <br>00:42:54.400 stable right now probably two major  <br>00:42:56.200 versions old I'm just guessing but my  <br>00:42:57.880 point is they open this up they get a  <br>00:43:00.880 Microsoft Word file from a coworker for  <br>00:43:03.680 example they get formatting issues and  <br>00:43:05.960 it doesn't look right and tables are  <br>00:43:07.880 broken and everything looks a mess I get  <br>00:43:10.480 the same file in the lib office version  <br>00:43:12.400 that's newer and it's fine but you know  <br>00:43:15.119 sometimes I think distributions have to  <br>00:43:16.640 realize that they themselves are you  <br>00:43:19.200 know making things harder for people  <br>00:43:21.079 yeah it's totally true so I don't know  <br>00:43:23.960 if we solved any issues today but hope  <br>00:43:25.680 we did hope we that's what I saying like  <br>00:43:27.960 throughout this whole week is like  <br>00:43:29.720 you're not going to solve all these  <br>00:43:31.079 issues in a day but it definitely takes  <br>00:43:33.240 you got to start somewhere and you got  <br>00:43:34.400 to have the conversations CU if you  <br>00:43:36.240 don't it's just going to keep going how  <br>00:43:38.480 it is and we've seen how it's going and  <br>00:43:40.480 obviously with linux's 6% desktop share  <br>00:43:44.319 if we want that to increase you're going  <br>00:43:46.240 to have to have conversations people are  <br>00:43:47.680 going to have to make tough decisions  <br>00:43:49.160 that some people don't like but you get  <br>00:43:51.800 some somebody's got to start making some  <br>00:43:53.359 decisions well we are the again we are  <br>00:43:55.839 the marketing for Linux we are the  <br>00:43:58.240 marketing the Linux Community Linux  <br>00:44:00.319 users we're we and especially YouTubers  <br>00:44:03.160 like ourselves we are the marketing you  <br>00:44:05.559 will not at least not now see a Linux  <br>00:44:07.960 related commercial on TV I haven't seen  <br>00:44:10.119 one personally maybe in some other  <br>00:44:11.359 countries where you know sus is more  <br>00:44:12.960 popular for example maybe that happens I  <br>00:44:14.520 don't know but we are the marketing  <br>00:44:16.920 which is why I put so much work into  <br>00:44:18.200 special effects in this channel because  <br>00:44:20.040 I want to position Linux in the best  <br>00:44:21.800 light possible because we all need to do  <br>00:44:24.599 that because if if we just need to do  <br>00:44:27.359 the best we can and and sometimes that  <br>00:44:29.000 could mean someone sees a problem and  <br>00:44:31.119 they want to step up and come up with a  <br>00:44:33.559 solution I encourage anybody in the  <br>00:44:36.280 audience share some ideas if you think  <br>00:44:37.960 you know a solution to this or even if  <br>00:44:40.359 it's in the form of new software you  <br>00:44:41.880 want to develop or or something that you  <br>00:44:44.119 want to not develop because you're not a  <br>00:44:45.839 developer but draw out on paper for all  <br>00:44:48.240 I care um if you have an idea I think we  <br>00:44:51.079 need to get those ideas to the people  <br>00:44:53.160 that can make that happen if that person  <br>00:44:55.079 isn't you and you know you know to  <br>00:44:58.319 actually put feet on the ground on these  <br>00:45:00.960 problems and get this solved and I I  <br>00:45:02.760 hope people in my community anybody  <br>00:45:05.480 that's complaining about something a  <br>00:45:07.160 valid complaint that's not something's  <br>00:45:08.800 not working do you have the time to do  <br>00:45:11.000 something about it do you have the  <br>00:45:12.599 expertise to do something about it if  <br>00:45:14.160 you don't do you know somebody that does  <br>00:45:15.920 do you know somewhere where this  <br>00:45:17.680 conversation can get started and that's  <br>00:45:20.000 what we need to do and I feel like we  <br>00:45:22.440 can we can get there but the Linux  <br>00:45:24.520 Community will be who decides that yeah  <br>00:45:27.079 100% and maybe we're back next year and  <br>00:45:30.000 things are different I hope so it'd be  <br>00:45:31.880 fun it' be fun to do a sequel to this is  <br>00:45:34.680 it better yet yeah that would be  <br>00:45:36.599 entertaining but yeah this was awesome  <br>00:45:38.800 it's good to sit down you know a lot of  <br>00:45:40.920 people their first impression of of  <br>00:45:42.720 Linux is bad and they get discouraged  <br>00:45:44.520 because they go to the forums and get  <br>00:45:46.280 that feedback but it's good to you know  <br>00:45:47.920 sit down and have a conversation about  <br>00:45:49.720 what your issues are without you know  <br>00:45:51.920 and and and talk about actual Solutions  <br>00:45:53.720 instead of just a bunch of angry  <br>00:45:56.520 comments and people screaming things  <br>00:45:59.960 that just don't help anybody so yeah  <br>00:46:02.800 like Jay said in the comments like if  <br>00:46:04.559 you know anybody if you have the  <br>00:46:05.680 expertise to make things better I'm all  <br>00:46:07.599 here for it I know I I had a Linux video  <br>00:46:10.800 where I failed but I legitimately am  <br>00:46:14.079 still using Linux I have the the laptop  <br>00:46:16.680 I brought it with me here it's what I've  <br>00:46:18.040 been using I'm still using Linux he's  <br>00:46:19.920 still trying it like like he's try he's  <br>00:46:21.640 he's he has he's doing a presentation  <br>00:46:23.520 about it meanwhile he's actively still  <br>00:46:26.599 right now I saw him just trying some  <br>00:46:28.200 stuff on Linux Mint with with your GPU  <br>00:46:30.480 issue so we'll be back next year to see  <br>00:46:33.760 where we're at but yes was this was  <br>00:46:35.720 awesome  <br>00:46:39.960 thanks and there's our video I hope you  <br>00:46:42.520 enjoyed today's video and this interview  <br>00:46:44.319 that I had with Brett it was a ton of  <br>00:46:45.680 fun and I

video what**0:19**we're going to do is check out app**0:21**Images an app image is a form of**0:24**software delivery it's basically an**0:26**all-in-one package a universal package**0:28**you download it run it and it's as**0:30**simple as that in this video what I'm**0:33**going to do is teach you everything that**0:35**you need to know to use app Images**0:37**you'll know what they are in the first**0:39**place how they work and why you might**0:41**want to consider using app Images over**0:43**other types of Linux packaging now if**0:46**you're not already familiar with the**0:47**concept Universal packages are a**0:50**relatively New Concept in Linux and the**0:52**idea is to have software being packaged**0:54**in a way where the drro doesn't matter**0:57**so that effectively means you could have**0:58**one application and it could run on just**1:01**about any distribution and this approach**1:03**is great for developers too because it**1:05**takes the dro out of the equation so if**1:07**someone is developing an app for Linux**1:09**then they only need to develop one thing**1:11**to Target the entirety of the Linux**1:13**community and then when it comes to you**1:15**the user you benefit because it doesn't**1:17**matter which distribution you run your**1:19**choice is respected you could use**1:20**anything you want and then you could**1:22**bring your applications with you and app**1:25**Images are one of three main types of**1:27**universal packages we have snap snap**1:30**packages flat packs and of course app**1:32**Images I already have videos in this**1:35**series on Snap packages and flat packs**1:37**so I'll leave a card for the snap video**1:39**right about here if you want to check**1:41**that out anyway I can't wait to dive inThe ad**1:44**but before I do I need to take a moment**1:46**and let you guys know that I have two**1:47**brand new courses available over on UD**1:49**to me first if you're in the process of**1:52**learning Linux for the very first time**1:53**you should definitely check out my Linux**1:55**Essentials course not only will this**1:57**course teach you everything you need to**1:58**know to get started Ed and learn the**2:00**basics of Linux it's also going to help**2:02**you get certified and earn your Linux**2:04**Essentials credential through LPI and**2:07**the Linux professional Institute is the**2:08**world's largest Linux and open source**2:10**focused vendor neutral certification**2:12**body so by earning certifications**2:14**through LPI your credentials will be**2:16**recognized around the world but even if**2:19**you don't have any interest in getting**2:20**certified this course is still a great**2:22**fit for those of you that are getting**2:23**started with Linux because it'll teach**2:25**you all the basics also I recently**2:28**released an anable course as well which**2:30**will teach you everything you need to**2:31**know to get up and running with anible**2:33**anible is one of if not the most popular**2:35**configuration and automation Platforms**2:37**in the Linux ecosystem so it's**2:39**definitely something that you need to**2:41**learn anible is a powerful and easy**2:43**tolearn platform that'll enable you to**2:45**automate even the most complicated Linux**2:47**Administration tasks and just like with**2:50**my Linux course each lesson will break**2:52**down even the most complicated**2:53**components and Concepts into easy to**2:56**understand lessons and by the end of the**2:57**course you'll learn everything that you**2:59**need to know know to use anible as part**3:01**of your daily tool set and as usual**3:03**thank you guys so much for supporting**3:05**Linux learning I really appreciate that**3:07**now it's time to dive into app images**3:09**and learn all about them so let's getWhat is an "AppImage"?**3:15**started so here we have an app image now**3:18**at first it doesn't look like much but**3:20**believe it or not this one file is a**3:23**complete application specifically Caden**3:25**live Caden live is an application you**3:27**could use to edit video in in fact I've**3:30**used Kaden live for many of the videos**3:32**on this channel before switching to D**3:34**Vinci resolve now this particular app**3:36**image I downloaded from the official**3:38**website so one thing to know about app**3:40**Images is that they could come from just**3:42**about anywhere often you'll find app**3:44**images on a developer's website when**3:46**they're making a program available and**3:47**it's not all that dissimilar to Windows**3:50**and Mac OS when you discover a new**3:51**application you download it you install**3:53**it but in this case we have an app image**3:55**so how do we go about running this well**3:58**the first thing we need to do is right**3:59**click on**4:01**it then we'll check the**4:04**properties and this might look different**4:06**for you depending on your desktop**4:07**environment but basically we want to go**4:09**to**4:10**permissions and we want to allow**4:12**executing as a program so I'll check**4:15**this right here and that's all we need**4:17**to do to make an app image work**4:19**seriously that's it so all we have to do**4:22**is just click on it like we would any**4:24**other**4:26**application so right here we have Caden**4:29**live how cool is**4:30**that now one thing to point out is that**4:34**I've created a directory called**4:37**applications it's very common when you**4:39**use app Images to want to save them all**4:40**in one place it doesn't really matter**4:42**where you save them you can even save**4:44**them in your home directory on your**4:45**desktop it doesn't really matter but**4:47**what I like to do is create a folder a**4:49**Parent Directory basically where all of**4:51**my app Images are going to live so we**4:54**only have this one right here so how do**4:57**we go about downloading an app image asHow do you generally obtain an AppImage?**5:00**I mentioned one of the most popular**5:01**places to find an app image is the**5:03**official website for whatever**5:04**application you're trying to install so**5:07**let's bring up a web**5:10**browser and here we have the browser so**5:13**what I'm going to do is just search for**5:15**bit**5:16**Worden then here's the official website**5:18**so I'll click on**5:20**that what we'll do is go to**5:23**download scroll down a bit here and you**5:26**can see that we have downloads for**5:28**Windows Mac OS and Linux so what I'm**5:31**going to do is click on**5:35**Linux and already I'm downloading an app**5:37**image seriously check this**5:39**out by default bit Wen is released as an**5:42**app image it's not the only way that you**5:44**could install bit Wen but it is a**5:46**popular way and it's available right**5:48**from the developer's website so we know**5:50**it's official we always want to make**5:52**sure that we're downloading applications**5:53**from official sources and it doesn't get**5:56**any more official than the official**5:57**website for the product so let's go**6:00**ahead and go back to our file manager**6:03**here and what I'm doing right now is**6:05**just grabbing it from my downloads**6:06**directory and I'm pasting the app image**6:09**into my applications directory and now**6:11**we have it so just like before I'm going**6:13**to right click on it I'm going to go**6:16**down to**6:18**properties let's allow executing as a**6:22**program we'll close it I'll just simply**6:25**click on**6:28**it and there you go bit Warden is now**6:31**running I didn't install it so there's**6:33**no installation procedure all I had to**6:35**do was download the app image make it**6:37**executable and I'm done and that's oneMore specifics regarding AppImages**6:40**of the main benefits of the app image**6:41**format there's no runtime or anything to**6:44**install or set up first you just simply**6:46**run an app image and that's it now when**6:48**you compare app Images to you know snap**6:51**packages and flat packs those formats**6:54**tend to be a little bit heavier now I**6:56**like all the formats don't get me wrong**6:58**I'm not saying you should pick one over**6:59**the other but what I'm saying though is**7:01**that there are clear differences for**7:03**example when it comes to snap packages**7:05**there's the snap store so when you want**7:07**to download a snap package in that**7:09**format you have to download it from the**7:11**Snap Store you also have to have snapd**7:13**installed as well so in that case there**7:15**is something that you need to install**7:17**first when it comes to Flat pack you**7:19**don't have to get flat packs from the**7:21**flathub App Store quote unquote App**7:24**Store and you do need to have flat pack**7:25**installed first before you can install a**7:28**flat pack but again with app Images you**7:30**don't have to install anything but one**7:32**of the bigger downsides of the app image**7:34**format is the**7:36**inconsistency for example earlier in the**7:38**video I downloaded Caden live and I ran**7:41**that when I did so it didn't ask me if I**7:43**wanted a desktop shortcut or an**7:45**application menu shortcut it just ran**7:48**and the problem here is if I check my**7:50**applications list it's not going to be**7:52**visible because it's not actually**7:54**installed and that kind of makes sense**7:56**because an app image is well just a file**7:59**there really isn't anything to install**8:01**so that's why we don't have a desktop**8:03**icon however some applications will ask**8:06**you if you want to integrate the**8:08**application which means create a desktop**8:10**or application launcher**8:12**shortcut now even though not every app**8:15**image will prompt you to create an**8:17**application launcher there is a**8:19**workaround and it's called app image**8:21**launcher and I already have it**8:23**downloaded right here I'm going to leave**8:24**a link to this in the description down**8:26**below but this is going to be a**8:28**distribution package this time note the**8:30**Deb format here in my case so when you**8:33**install app image launcher it basically**8:35**manages all of this for you so I'm just**8:37**going to install it right**8:39**now now the package is installed but**8:42**there's not really a whole lot to see**8:44**this is going to run in the background**8:47**but basically what that will do is**8:49**intercept the fact that we are opening**8:50**an app image so it'll see that we're**8:53**opening one and if a launcher isn't**8:55**already on the system for whatever one**8:57**we're launching it's going to give us an**8:59**option to create that so for example**9:02**what I'll do is open Kaden live**9:04**again and we see immediately that app**9:07**image launcher saw that we were**9:09**launching an app image and sprang into**9:12**action so right now it's going to see**9:15**the folder that we're currently inside**9:17**of and just assume that that's the**9:18**folder where all of our app Images are**9:20**going to be you could customize this and**9:23**you should customize this if you want to**9:24**put them somewhere else but that's okay**9:26**for me so I'll just click okay and right**9:29**now it's offering to integrate it for us**9:31**we could run once or integrate it into**9:33**our system run once is useful if you**9:36**only plan on running an app image just**9:38**one time but if you plan on keeping it**9:40**around you might want to click this**9:41**button right**9:46**here now we see that the app image is**9:50**launching and when I try to open**9:53**applications we can see that Caden live**9:55**is listed right there so as you can see**9:58**even though there's some downsides with**10:00**app Images there's some easy workarounds**10:02**to make it even**10:04**better now before I close out the videoAppImage Hub**10:07**I just wanted to show you guys one more**10:08**thing and that is the app image Hub so**10:11**even though there's no one app store for**10:14**app images and you could also download**10:16**them from the vendor's website most of**10:18**the time you'll also find app Images**10:20**here as well and this might be a good**10:22**place to start so let's click browse all**10:28**apps and and you can see that there's**10:30**quite a few listed**10:31**here now obviously I can't show you all**10:34**of them there's over 1,300 app images on**10:36**the site but if you're looking for a**10:38**good place to start then app image Hub**10:41**might be a great place I'll be sure to**10:43**have a link in the description down**10:44**below if you want to check it**10:48**out and there you go we just took a look**10:51**at app images in this video I love app**10:53**Images they're just so cool it's a**10:55**wonder why they're not more popular**10:57**hopefully this video will increase their**10:59**popularity because I think it's**11:01**definitely something that you should**11:02**check out anyway thank you so much for**11:04**checking out this video I really**11:06**appreciate it and I'll see you in the**11:07**next video**11:10**[Music]**11:25**[Music]English (auto-generated)[40:57Now

guys about spin right now**0:21**spin right might be an unlikely choice**0:23**for a Linux related YouTube channel and**0:25**it kind of is but the thing is this**0:27**application does have a use case for**0:30**Linux**0:31**users but what exactly is spin right**0:34**well spin right is a Dos utility and its**0:36**main purpose is to prevent and recover**0:39**from data loss and hard drive failure**0:41**respectively spin R is run from a USB**0:43**flash drive or CD so it bypasses the**0:46**underlying operating system of your**0:47**computer or server once booted it'll**0:49**give you a choice of a few different**0:50**types of scans or levels and once you**0:53**run a desired test against a drive you**0:55**simply wait for the results I'll talk**0:57**more about spin right's capabilities as**0:59**well as its pros and cons later in the**1:01**video now before we get started though IWhy make this video?**1:03**just wanted to mention that this video**1:05**is not sponsored by GRC the creator of**1:08**spin rate now actually I don't even know**1:10**if GRC is even aware that this channel**1:12**even exists I've been using this app for**1:14**quite some time and I decided a long**1:16**time ago to do a video about it the**1:19**thing is back then it was mentioned that**1:21**6.1 was being worked on so I decided**1:24**that it just didn't make sense to create**1:26**a video about something that was going**1:29**to just be updated dated so I decided to**1:30**wait and that wait turned into well**1:33**quite a long time but now 6.1 is finally**1:36**out and I decided to give it a review in**1:38**this video but perhaps the bigger**1:40**question though is why is the Linux guy**1:42**reviewing a Dos application well here's**1:45**the thing there's a great deal of Linux**1:47**administrators and homeb fans within my**1:49**audience when it comes to my home lab**1:51**audience one of the many amazing things**1:53**that they do is keep servers out of**1:54**landfills and that's awesome people that**1:57**are into self-hosting regularly**1:59**repurpose out ofate corporate equipment**2:01**all the time since servers that may no**2:02**longer be good enough for the Enterprise**2:04**are still plenty good enough for all of**2:05**you mad scientists out there now keep in**2:08**mind if you repurpose old servers then**2:10**you're also repurposing old hard drives**2:12**and that brings me to the first benefit**2:14**that spin right has for Linux users if**2:16**you purchase a secondhand server running**2:18**spin right on it before you put it into**2:20**production can only benefit you as spin**2:23**right can trigger error correction on**2:24**hard disk better than the OEM tools can**2:27**this way if there's any problematic**2:28**sectors on any of your hard discs it's a**2:30**good idea to have them detected before**2:32**you put a server into production not**2:35**after now for those of you that have had**2:37**servers in production for a long time**2:39**it's a good idea to run spin rate on**2:41**those every now and then maybe every**2:43**year or so that's just a personal**2:44**opinion on my side but it shouldn't hurt**2:47**you might even find that your Hardware**2:48**performs better after doing so I mean**2:51**your family can be without the Plex**2:53**server for a little bit can't they maybe**2:54**it's a good excuse to go**2:56**outside another use case for spin right**2:59**is for data recover recovery in fact**3:01**spinrite is one of three bootable tools**3:03**that I feel every administrator needs**3:05**the other two being mem test 86 and a**3:07**live image of your favorite Linux drro**3:09**now if you've potentially lost files**3:11**perhaps your devices and booting then**3:12**running spin right against the drive**3:14**might actually help you get your files**3:16**back it's possible that spin right's**3:18**airor correction might even repair the**3:19**drive but I figure if you have to go**3:21**through a bunch of work to get your**3:23**files back you may not want to trust**3:25**that drive any longer but I**3:27**digress data recovery features make spin**3:30**very useful in the Enterprise but home**3:31**users can definitely benefit from that**3:33**too now the way that spin right works ifWhat exactly does SpinRite do?**3:35**I put it very simply is that it gives**3:37**your hard disk a bit of a workout it**3:39**writes complex data to sectors in order**3:40**to test their read and write capability**3:43**and if there's a problem here the sector**3:44**will be marked bad and another will**3:46**replace it now to be fair so far that's**3:49**nothing unique even the manufacturer's**3:51**tools can do what I just described and**3:53**you can also do the same thing with open**3:55**source tools and there's probably a**3:56**dozen or so other ways I could think of**3:59**but the value of spin right is that it**4:01**tries really really really hard and**4:03**focuses very intensely on your disc more**4:06**intensely than even the manufacturers**4:08**tools generally do basically spinrite**4:10**has just one job and it does it very**4:12**well sorry to interrupt my own video butCheck out the updated merch shop! merch.learnlinux.tv**4:15**I just wanted to let you know that I**4:17**appreciate each and every single one of**4:19**you and I love creating Linux related**4:20**content for you guys but unfortunately**4:22**producing high quality Linux content**4:25**like this isn't cheap but if you want

really appreciate it now let's**5:03**get back to the**5:05**video more specifically there's threeSpinRite's "Levels"**5:07**different operating modes or levels of**5:09**spin right and the one that you'll end**5:11**up using depends on your needs level one**5:13**is a more basic read test that's not**5:15**super intensive but is good enough to**5:17**make sure all the data on your hard**5:18**drive is readable level two on the other**5:20**hand kicks things up a notch and**5:22**attempts recovery of any data found on**5:24**your drive that might not be readable**5:26**that's why if you want to perform data**5:27**recovery you might want to consider**5:28**starting here**5:30**level three is the most intensive**5:31**rewriting all data on your drive this**5:34**will help ensure that all data resides**5:35**only in sections of your hard disk known**5:37**to be within normal operation however**5:40**this test might take a lot longer to**5:41**complete if you want to check out spinSpinRite purchase and setup experience**5:43**right for yourself it'll set you back**5:45**$89 so this isn't free software but I**5:48**figure that the price tag is reasonable**5:50**for how useful it is and who knows maybe**5:52**someone within my audience will find it**5:54**useful once purchased you'll receive a**5:56**ridiculously tiny executable that's so**5:58**small you'll probably think think that**5:59**your download was disconnected but no**6:02**it's really that small this executable**6:05**will only run on Windows unfortunately**6:06**but you only have to run it once since**6:08**what it does is write spin rate to a**6:10**bootable Drive such as a flash drive of**6:13**course you can create bootable spin rate**6:14**media on Mac OS and Linux as well**6:17**there's an image file that's included**6:18**that you can use with your platform's**6:20**respective dis utility to create the**6:21**media now it's recommended that you use**6:23**the windows tool though but if you're**6:25**oppositional you could always write the**6:26**image**6:27**manually now before you go and thisThe downsides of SpinRite**6:30**though there are a few important**6:31**downsides to consider first in order to**6:34**use spin rate you'll need to modify the**6:35**settings of your host device in**6:37**particular what you'll need to do is**6:39**boot into Bios mode and also disable**6:41**secure boot now the author spin right is**6:44**quick to caution against disabling**6:45**secure boot unless you read the**6:47**documentation first so that way you can**6:49**understand if there's any other**6:50**ramifications of doing so generally**6:53**speaking you'll switch your computer to**6:54**Bios mode and disable secure boot run**6:57**spin right and then go back to your**6:58**computer settings and set everything**7:00**back to the way it was before continuing**7:01**to use it it sounds like a pain and well**7:04**it is but thankfully Steve mentions that**7:07**future versions will address this my**7:09**advice is rather than changing your**7:10**computer settings you could repurpose an**7:12**old desktop as a spin right machine**7:15**which you could do is power it on**7:16**disable secure boot switch it to Bios**7:18**mode and then leave it powered off then**7:21**what you could do anytime you want to**7:23**use spin right is you could take the**7:24**drive out of the device and just run it**7:26**from the spin right computer but that**7:29**might be overkill for some of you but**7:30**who knows thankfully though the biggest**7:33**downside has been addressed in version**7:34**6.1 for the longest time spin right has**7:37**been very slow painfully slow and this**7:40**is another reason why I was waiting for**7:41**the latest version to come out before**7:43**reviewing it it was so slow that it**7:45**wasn't uncommon for me to leave a**7:46**machine running over the weekend and**7:48**most of the time a scan would be**7:49**finished by the time it came back**7:51**however 6.1 has a Rewritten engine that**7:53**is much faster than before and I could**7:55**definitely notice the difference in fact**7:58**this is the main selling point of the**7:59**new version I received 6.1 as a free**8:02**upgrade from having purchased the**8:03**original version a long time back and I**8:05**think this speed boost more than makes**8:06**it worth the wait another potential**8:09**downside when it comes to spin right is**8:11**that purchasing it can be somewhat like**8:13**an insurance policy that you may or may**8:14**not find useful I mean think of it this**8:16**way you don't know ahead of time if**8:18**you're going to suffer a data recovery**8:20**issue and have to recover data you can't**8:22**really know that ahead of time so if you**8:24**purchase spin rate you're purchasing**8:26**something for a problem that you hope**8:28**you never have but if you do have that**8:30**problem then well you hope that it's**8:32**useful and whether or not it's useful**8:34**really depends on the problem that**8:36**you're trying to solve spin right is not**8:38**something that's going to fix every hard**8:40**drive issue if your computer itself**8:42**can't even detect the hard drive then**8:44**spin right won't be able to do that**8:45**either so we need to have you know**8:47**reasonable expectations here but as long**8:50**as we do that then spin right is really**8:52**useful that said I think spin right is**8:55**worth the purchase sure it's one of**8:57**those things that you hope you'll never**8:58**need and if you do need it you hope to**9:00**be glad that you did get it but aside**9:03**from that it's also good for**9:04**preventative maintenance as well and it**9:06**might even give you a performance boost**9:09**now let me know what you think of spin**9:10**right or any other tool that I mention**9:12**on this channel in the description down**9:14**below I can't wait to read what you guys**9:16**have to say in the meantime though**9:17**definitely subscribe to learn Linux TV**9:19**for the latest in Linux if you haven't**9:21**already done that and I'll see you in**9:22**the next videoEnglish (auto-generated)|## SUMMARY  <br>The video presents a review of SpinRite 6.1, a data recovery tool for Linux users.

(Featuring @RaidOwl)  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/cHqF71nz01g](https://www.youtube.com/watch/cHqF71nz01g)  <br>  <br>00:00:01.370 [Music]  <br>00:00:08.860 [Music]  <br>00:00:14.519 hello and welcome back to learn Linux TV  <br>00:00:17.439 as you can probably tell if you're a  <br>00:00:19.279 subscriber of this channel already I'm  <br>00:00:21.119 not in my usual location actually I'm in  <br>00:00:24.439 Sydney Nova Scotia Canada and I'm here  <br>00:00:27.160 at 45 drives headquarters for their  <br>00:00:29.960 Creator Summit and I'm having a ton of  <br>00:00:31.840 fun in fact I'm one of several YouTubers  <br>00:00:34.840 that are here at this event and one of  <br>00:00:37.760 which is Brett he's known on YouTube as  <br>00:00:39.800 raid owl and he's been someone that I've  <br>00:00:42.360 talked to for quite some time now but I  <br>00:00:44.600 haven't had a chance to collaborate with  <br>00:00:46.239 him until now so what I'm going to do in  <br>00:00:48.640 today's video is play back an interview  <br>00:00:50.719 that I had with him where we discussed  <br>00:00:52.920 what's wrong with Linux but before we  <br>00:00:55.280 get to that though I need to make you  <br>00:00:56.879 aware that my merchandise shop the  <br>00:00:58.879 official merch shop for learn Linux TV  <br>00:01:00.800 has been recently updated with brand new  <br>00:01:03.000 products inside the shop you'll find  <br>00:01:05.040 drro themed shirts bags drink wear and  <br>00:01:07.400 more and there's some other surprises  <br>00:01:09.280 there as well for example I've just  <br>00:01:11.200 introduced a mouse pad that doubles as a  <br>00:01:12.920 t-mo cheat sheet how cool is that you  <br>00:01:15.520 could get yourself something really cool  <br>00:01:17.280 and support Linux learning at the same  <br>00:01:19.240 time so it's a win-win thank you so much  <br>00:01:21.799 for supporting learn Linux TV I really  <br>00:01:23.880 appreciate it now at this point what  <br>00:01:25.840 we're going to do is play back the  <br>00:01:27.720 interview that I had with Brett but I  <br>00:01:29.520 want you to be prepared to subscribe to  <br>00:01:32.320 his channel you're going to want to if  <br>00:01:34.000 you haven't already done so anyway let's  <br>00:01:36.119 check out the  <br>00:01:39.680 interview all right so I'm here with  <br>00:01:41.680 Brett from the YouTube channel raid owl  <br>00:01:44.079 how you doing I'm doing good and it's  <br>00:01:46.880 Brett not Brent I want to be clear on  <br>00:01:48.520 that it's Brett not Brent not Brad I've  <br>00:01:51.799 gotten quite a few ones but yeah Brett  <br>00:01:53.719 Brad seems kind of hard to get out of  <br>00:01:55.159 that I don't know how I can't excuse  <br>00:01:56.719 that it's it's I guess it's my accent  <br>00:01:59.320 something with with Southern Accents  <br>00:02:01.520 make it really hard for people to  <br>00:02:02.880 understand Brett like it's it's usually  <br>00:02:04.240 a 50/50 for people to get my name right  <br>00:02:06.240 which is impressive but so we're here at  <br>00:02:09.720 45 drives HQ in Nova Scotia Canada  <br>00:02:13.760 Sydney um and it's been several days  <br>00:02:17.400 like I'm losing track of time like I  <br>00:02:18.760 always do but we've had uh a number of  <br>00:02:21.280 discussions we're brought in for a very  <br>00:02:23.440 specific P purpose um what I was  <br>00:02:25.720 thinking we could do is kind of talk a  <br>00:02:27.760 little bit about your presentation  <br>00:02:30.400 um and then maybe some of the experience  <br>00:02:33.000 that we had here at 45 drives okay yeah  <br>00:02:36.319 so my presentation and and all 45 drives  <br>00:02:40.280 brought us creators in to discuss uh D  <br>00:02:44.959 microsof ification that was the theme of  <br>00:02:47.879 yeah they made sure to make sure you say  <br>00:02:49.959 that right yes it's basically about how  <br>00:02:51.840 do we get from Windows dominating  <br>00:02:54.840 everything to having a more open source  <br>00:02:59.680 uh Community I mean we have one but I  <br>00:03:02.200 mean like how do we get that in the end  <br>00:03:03.519 users hands how do we adjust from being  <br>00:03:05.280 so relying on Windows to right open  <br>00:03:07.959 source so we all did presentations and  <br>00:03:12.080 um mine was on my 30 days of Linux  <br>00:03:17.159 challenge in which I failed uh I have a  <br>00:03:20.040 video on it it was an attempt to use  <br>00:03:23.799 Linux only for 30 days now I'm a I'm a  <br>00:03:26.159 Mac person I use a Macbook for Mac OS  <br>00:03:29.879 obviously and my main workstation is  <br>00:03:32.239 Windows machine and I was like I will  <br>00:03:35.599 put Linux Mint on a Dell xps15 and I  <br>00:03:39.560 will use that for 30 days and I will  <br>00:03:41.760 document my experience um I am not a  <br>00:03:44.400 Linux expert you are a Linux expert um I  <br>00:03:48.720 ran into issues I failed if you watch  <br>00:03:50.959 the video it's in the title everything I  <br>00:03:52.920 I I failed at 22 days um for various  <br>00:03:56.560 reasons and I talked about that and we  <br>00:03:58.040 had a lively discussion about why may be  <br>00:04:01.319 um and yeah it was it was just a good  <br>00:04:03.599 discussion if you want me to go into  <br>00:04:04.920 like some of the specifics yeah I think  <br>00:04:06.480 we will I just wanted to say that um I  <br>00:04:09.000 don't think you failed because you don't  <br>00:04:11.519 fail when you try and I think failure is  <br>00:04:14.319 not even even trying in the first place  <br>00:04:16.680 because I see a lot of times where  <br>00:04:18.160 people will barely try you know they'll  <br>00:04:20.040 try a live CD for an hour right and  <br>00:04:23.040 that's it and then they're done um but  <br>00:04:25.240 that was a serious attempt and I feel  <br>00:04:27.160 like you never know what's at the end of  <br>00:04:28.800 that you could be oh this is the best  <br>00:04:30.520 thing ever I've switched everything or I  <br>00:04:32.240 got to switch back because it didn't  <br>00:04:33.720 work out but um my understanding from  <br>00:04:36.479 your presentation was very reasonable  <br>00:04:38.360 you you ran into some very valid  <br>00:04:40.080 problems that need to be you know kind  <br>00:04:41.960 of looked at I think yeah and it's and  <br>00:04:43.639 it's hard like from a a Linux novice now  <br>00:04:47.000 if you watch my channel like yeah I do  <br>00:04:49.440 uh home labbing stuff and I I am way  <br>00:04:52.600 more um comfortable with using Linux and  <br>00:04:56.960 the Enterprise level as a server  <br>00:04:59.199 obviously where it dominates the market  <br>00:05:01.120 but everyone knows the meme this is the  <br>00:05:03.240 year of the Linux desktop so that's a  <br>00:05:05.199 whole different ball game so yeah I went  <br>00:05:07.560 into it with that in mind and uh the  <br>00:05:11.039 biggest pain points I had were from uh  <br>00:05:15.240 hardware issues whether that be my insta  <br>00:05:18.280 360 webcam deciding to go in earthquake  <br>00:05:21.639 mode in the middle of a live stream wow  <br>00:05:24.400 um sounds like a feature but I don't I  <br>00:05:25.960 don't think it sounds useful it was cool  <br>00:05:28.120 but not what I wanted at the time but  <br>00:05:30.759 yeah I was on Tom Lawrence's stream and  <br>00:05:32.360 it just decided to do that and it's that  <br>00:05:35.880 was a frustrating thing and also because  <br>00:05:37.919 the insta 360 software to control that  <br>00:05:41.360 webcam doesn't exist in Linux it's just  <br>00:05:44.120 you can't get it um that was one issue  <br>00:05:47.600 that was kind of annoying another one  <br>00:05:49.240 was I was having issues with my  <br>00:05:51.720 Thunderbolt dock I would just sometimes  <br>00:05:54.600 decide that yeah we're not going to  <br>00:05:56.120 detect monitors and it's hard to narrow  <br>00:06:00.120 down what is specifically a Linux  <br>00:06:03.039 problem versus what is a Dell problem  <br>00:06:06.280 versus what is a combination of Linux  <br>00:06:08.680 with Dell with uh Thunderbolt with the  <br>00:06:11.120 specific dock type thing and I know in  <br>00:06:14.599 your presentation you you talked about  <br>00:06:16.560 testing hardware and that's probably  <br>00:06:18.120 something I should have uh looked at  <br>00:06:20.479 before doing this and I think that's a  <br>00:06:21.880 valid point because I think I was  <br>00:06:23.520 telling you I when I started this I  <br>00:06:26.039 wanted a laptop and I almost went with a  <br>00:06:28.000 system 76 one which is famously known  <br>00:06:31.280 for you run window or you run Linux on  <br>00:06:33.919 those I was like ah you know for the  <br>00:06:36.039 price I can get a used D  <br>00:06:38.560 xps15 um with you know better specs and  <br>00:06:42.240 so I got that and you know I read a  <br>00:06:43.639 couple of forum posts that it was it  <br>00:06:45.120 worked well with Linux and it was just  <br>00:06:47.360 so many issues and then the second one  <br>00:06:49.199 came down to software like I am heavily  <br>00:06:52.960 reliant on Photoshop and Lightroom  <br>00:06:56.160 Lightroom is one of the main ones that I  <br>00:06:57.639 won't budge on and and when I needed  <br>00:07:00.800 access to some of those pictures that  <br>00:07:03.400 were edited in Lightroom right I did not  <br>00:07:06.440 have them so these are just like a  <br>00:07:09.840 couple of things that just just kept  <br>00:07:12.240 eating at me until you know you got to  <br>00:07:15.680 get work done yeah and so you have to  <br>00:07:17.440 get stuff done and it just boiled over  <br>00:07:20.919 yeah I think so so one of my opinions  <br>00:07:23.840 and and less so with your presentation  <br>00:07:26.039 cuz I think for you it was like  <br>00:07:27.840 switching your workflow over and  <br>00:07:29.039 everything which is  <br>00:07:30.039 kind of how it goes but sometimes when  <br>00:07:33.280 you when people compare the situation  <br>00:07:34.879 with Linux and windows I don't always  <br>00:07:36.240 think it's quite the same comparison for  <br>00:07:38.240 example if you bought an HP laptop that  <br>00:07:41.280 runs windows then in their R&D lab they  <br>00:07:44.520 have made sure that each and every  <br>00:07:46.319 component works and I did Windows  <br>00:07:48.599 Administration for a long time uh one of  <br>00:07:50.639 the things I like to do back then was I  <br>00:07:52.800 would just wipe the manufacturer image  <br>00:07:54.560 from the drive cuz they'd have all this  <br>00:07:55.919 bloatware like you know inkjet ads or  <br>00:07:59.039 whatever it is that are on there so I  <br>00:08:00.720 just put put on the Microsoft image and  <br>00:08:03.879 when I do this I have like five or 10  <br>00:08:07.039 drivers to find but that wasn't that's  <br>00:08:09.319 not a problem because that's just the  <br>00:08:10.919 industry that okay fine I just install  <br>00:08:12.639 the drivers and it's good but when you  <br>00:08:14.919 have HP doing that they put the drivers  <br>00:08:17.680 on and they tested the audio card they  <br>00:08:20.400 tested the Wi-Fi card for Windows and  <br>00:08:24.159 one issue is when we come behind them  <br>00:08:27.440 and then we put Linux on it we become  <br>00:08:30.599 the R&D for Linux at that point because  <br>00:08:33.159 HP decided not to do that and sure they  <br>00:08:35.479 did have a Linux laptop recently that  <br>00:08:37.159 was a really good one but um I think  <br>00:08:40.719 sometimes the experiment can be  <br>00:08:42.320 different if you you know have a Windows  <br>00:08:46.360 laptop that's shipped with Windows and  <br>00:08:48.240 you have a laptop that's shipped with  <br>00:08:49.720 Linux now you're not guaranteed to have  <br>00:08:51.600 a perfect experience cuz if the  <br>00:08:53.080 manufacturer did a poor job you're still  <br>00:08:55.279 run into the same problem but it it's  <br>00:08:58.399 kind of like I feel like Linux is  <br>00:09:00.920 marketed as the everything OS too much  <br>00:09:03.360 where people say oh it runs on  <br>00:09:04.640 everything you should install it and  <br>00:09:06.120 they brag it up and I love it but I feel  <br>00:09:08.399 like they're bragging it too much and  <br>00:09:09.920 they're kind of setting people up for  <br>00:09:11.360 this expectation that may not align to  <br>00:09:13.440 reality yeah um one thing uh I I found  <br>00:09:18.360 out when doing this and I'd be curious  <br>00:09:21.560 to know how true you think this is is  <br>00:09:24.360 that I found when asking for help or  <br>00:09:27.440 trying to get general advice on some the  <br>00:09:29.560 issues I was having um whether they'd be  <br>00:09:33.200 like simple things like U mounting  <br>00:09:35.600 Network shares like I I just want to do  <br>00:09:37.600 that in the gooey like I can do in  <br>00:09:38.839 Windows and it's almost like overly  <br>00:09:41.480 complicated to do it and when I asked  <br>00:09:44.640 for that I was almost like made fun of  <br>00:09:46.920 because I wanted it in the goey and it  <br>00:09:48.880 was like the Linux I want to say the  <br>00:09:51.120 Linux Community cuz that's such a  <br>00:09:52.839 stereotype but certain users in the  <br>00:09:55.040 Linux Community almost fetishize making  <br>00:09:58.839 things different  <br>00:10:00.240 like they take pride in how difficult  <br>00:10:02.519 something is to do and if you want to  <br>00:10:03.920 make it easier it's almost like oh  <br>00:10:06.519 you're not built for Linux then buddy  <br>00:10:08.360 you better go back to to Windows do you  <br>00:10:11.680 see that I do there's so much toxicity  <br>00:10:15.160 in the Linux community and I don't want  <br>00:10:16.720 to make it out to be that every  <br>00:10:18.040 community that serves a Linux  <br>00:10:19.800 distribution is bad I don't want to say  <br>00:10:21.480 that at all but there are some out there  <br>00:10:23.360 I won't disparage them and name them but  <br>00:10:25.760 what I find is that you have helpful  <br>00:10:28.279 communities you have have toxic  <br>00:10:29.920 communities and for an example in my  <br>00:10:32.880 forums an rtfm response is a banable  <br>00:10:37.200 that's banable you are not allowed to  <br>00:10:38.880 say that on my forums because my mindset  <br>00:10:41.360 is either answer the person's question  <br>00:10:43.839 or don't right you know CU I get upset  <br>00:10:46.800 when someone gets you know rtfm like you  <br>00:10:48.959 didn't have to respond because number  <br>00:10:51.839 one you're going to trigger their  <br>00:10:53.920 opposition which is not going to get  <br>00:10:55.800 them to comply they are not going to  <br>00:10:57.680 search like you're telling them to  <br>00:10:59.320 they're not going to check the manual  <br>00:11:00.760 like you're telling them to you've  <br>00:11:02.519 pissed them off that's the only thing  <br>00:11:04.079 that you've you've done and we need to  <br>00:11:05.800 and I understand that it sometimes is so  <br>00:11:08.680 annoying to answer the same questions  <br>00:11:10.480 over and over and over again but that's  <br>00:11:12.279 what we have to do and we have to do it  <br>00:11:14.839 with a smile on her face and anything  <br>00:11:16.959 else is doing a disservice say like why  <br>00:11:19.000 are you on a forum then if you're not  <br>00:11:20.360 there to answer questions like it's yeah  <br>00:11:23.040 it's like it's like this and and the  <br>00:11:24.760 thing is if you want to help out in a  <br>00:11:26.160 community answering questions in the  <br>00:11:28.120 Forum is not the only thing you can do  <br>00:11:29.839 so if that's something that's rubbing  <br>00:11:31.040 you the wrong way maybe you feel like  <br>00:11:32.360 it's aggravating you or something and  <br>00:11:34.160 you might give a response like that you  <br>00:11:35.880 could maybe take a break from it and go  <br>00:11:37.480 help somewhere else behind closed doors  <br>00:11:39.519 maybe documentation if you're a coder  <br>00:11:41.320 maybe you could do that so I just don't  <br>00:11:43.480 get why people are are snarky like that  <br>00:11:46.519 when why are you there yeah and it's  <br>00:11:48.959 it's I I've seen it before and I've been  <br>00:11:50.839 on both sides and and I get it that's  <br>00:11:53.639 some questions are frustrating to answer  <br>00:11:56.000 over and over and some may seem you know  <br>00:11:58.720 really simple but from the other  <br>00:12:00.680 person's perspective you don't know how  <br>00:12:02.279 much courage it took them to walk into  <br>00:12:04.920 that forum and know that they are going  <br>00:12:06.399 to sound dumb asking a basic question  <br>00:12:09.519 right and I know some people some people  <br>00:12:11.120 are just annoying some people come in  <br>00:12:12.600 and refuse to get the help that they  <br>00:12:14.880 need and it's just at some point you  <br>00:12:16.920 know if you have to walk away and say  <br>00:12:18.720 sorry I can't help like that's fine like  <br>00:12:21.800 some people are just like that we get  <br>00:12:23.600 that but yeah saying read read the  <br>00:12:26.600 manual like that that's frust in and  <br>00:12:30.000 very discouraging and you only get one  <br>00:12:32.000 opportunity to make a first impression  <br>00:12:34.000 true so if someone's coming in here and  <br>00:12:35.440 trying Linux for the first time or  <br>00:12:36.760 you're distro for the first time and  <br>00:12:38.160 that's the response they get you think  <br>00:12:40.480 they're ever going to come back and no  <br>00:12:42.240 and and we are the marketing firm for  <br>00:12:44.519 Linux I need everyone to understand this  <br>00:12:46.480 like there's no one company yes there's  <br>00:12:48.880 big companies behind distributions but  <br>00:12:51.560 there's no Microsoft that owns  <br>00:12:54.040 everything and makes all the rules it's  <br>00:12:55.680 a community project we celebrate the  <br>00:12:58.560 fact that there's all this all these  <br>00:13:00.079 different um different you know  <br>00:13:01.600 distributions we celebrate the choice  <br>00:13:03.760 but then we flame people for using the  <br>00:13:06.920 choice like we say oh Linux is great  <br>00:13:08.839 because we have a bunch of distributions  <br>00:13:10.959 but then when they go to post a message  <br>00:13:12.360 why are you using that distribution  <br>00:13:13.800 you're stupid you should be using that  <br>00:13:15.040 distribution so at one point we're we're  <br>00:13:17.040 bragging about all the choice with Linux  <br>00:13:21.240 and when people exercise that choice  <br>00:13:23.440 then you know some people kind of don't  <br>00:13:25.120 don't seem to like that very much yeah  <br>00:13:26.959 and I one comment I got a lot on my  <br>00:13:28.880 video video  <br>00:13:30.560 was uh the Dr chose it doesn't matter  <br>00:13:33.120 what you chose the dro doesn't matter  <br>00:13:35.320 and I feel like to an extent that's kind  <br>00:13:37.639 of true but also not true it it's going  <br>00:13:41.360 to a point where the distribution won't  <br>00:13:42.959 matter at some point in the future we're  <br>00:13:44.920 not there yet it it's possible that the  <br>00:13:47.000 distribution doesn't matter for a  <br>00:13:48.360 particular person for example if their  <br>00:13:51.279 apps all just so happen to be within  <br>00:13:53.440 flathub they're good right they it  <br>00:13:55.920 doesn't matter what distribution they're  <br>00:13:57.199 on at that point they can install their  <br>00:13:58.720 favorite applications but if one of  <br>00:14:00.199 their favorite applications is not there  <br>00:14:02.560 then they have to go get it a different  <br>00:14:04.040 way so we have the Frameworks and we  <br>00:14:05.800 have flat pack we have wh and all these  <br>00:14:07.519 different things that are really going  <br>00:14:09.120 to make things better but they're not  <br>00:14:12.079 being developed fast enough and I'm not  <br>00:14:14.680 going to disparage the programmers here  <br>00:14:16.800 because I don't really think it's their  <br>00:14:18.040 fault what I feel like is you have  <br>00:14:19.759 system D Wayland flat pack snap insert  <br>00:14:23.839 name of thing here you know people are  <br>00:14:26.079 really passionate about developing this  <br>00:14:28.480 and they think that they're doing a  <br>00:14:29.639 great thing I think they're doing a  <br>00:14:30.800 great thing and then when they release  <br>00:14:32.440 it people are like I hate snaps I hate  <br>00:14:34.959 flat packs I hate system D I hate  <br>00:14:36.920 Wayland And that's think about it like  <br>00:14:38.759 this you get a a developer that's  <br>00:14:40.639 excited and their spirits and they're  <br>00:14:42.720 going to get discouraged so here we are  <br>00:14:44.480 expecting these Technologies to grow  <br>00:14:47.279 faster so it can get us there but what  <br>00:14:49.440 we're doing is we're just slamming the  <br>00:14:52.680 Developers for their decisions to a  <br>00:14:54.480 toxic level there I mean some have  <br>00:14:56.839 received death threats in the past I  <br>00:14:58.560 mean it gets to be a point where if I  <br>00:15:01.079 don't know if it were me and I was one  <br>00:15:02.959 of those developers I don't think I  <br>00:15:04.839 would write code as fast because I  <br>00:15:07.000 wouldn't be as excited to do it knowing  <br>00:15:09.079 that once I'm finished people are still  <br>00:15:11.440 going to be upset with me and I feel  <br>00:15:13.000 like that really slows things down a lot  <br>00:15:15.279 yeah it's that and it's also I think we  <br>00:15:17.279 discussed it in in one of our meetings  <br>00:15:19.440 um we might discussed it multiple times  <br>00:15:21.320 was um releasing things before they're  <br>00:15:24.880 ready because it goes back to you only  <br>00:15:27.000 get one first impression like right want  <br>00:15:29.160 this feature uh okay uh let's develop it  <br>00:15:32.519 crank it out there oh wait it doesn't  <br>00:15:34.639 actually work that well and now that  <br>00:15:37.240 feature is just known as being buggy and  <br>00:15:40.440 crap reputation is everything reputation  <br>00:15:42.959 especially when you have all these  <br>00:15:44.959 different dros in  <br>00:15:47.519 Windows you can get a bad reputation for  <br>00:15:49.920 a certain feature but it doesn't matter  <br>00:15:51.639 because you're still going to use  <br>00:15:52.560 Windows like that's that's what happens  <br>00:15:55.680 if you use Windows and you're used to it  <br>00:15:57.319 you're used to having these things  <br>00:15:58.560 happen but it doesn't matter cuz what  <br>00:16:00.000 else are you going to do in lenux if a  <br>00:16:03.480 drro that is promising that is making  <br>00:16:06.199 advances  <br>00:16:07.319 but they just for some reason or another  <br>00:16:09.920 whether that's self-inflicted or from  <br>00:16:11.600 some other means gets a negative  <br>00:16:13.639 reputation right people are just going  <br>00:16:15.600 to hop to a different one and that  <br>00:16:17.440 that's right I mean we look at a long  <br>00:16:19.639 time ago I mean I was a fan of KD for  <br>00:16:21.560 for a long time I still am even though  <br>00:16:23.160 it's not my daily driver I still like it  <br>00:16:24.480 a lot um but there was a point where I  <br>00:16:26.360 was using it full-time and I remember  <br>00:16:28.199 when KD for 4.0 came out it was  <br>00:16:30.839 extremely buggy you could barely keep it  <br>00:16:33.000 running um almost nothing worked well  <br>00:16:36.000 and then you know it's a 4.0 release  <br>00:16:38.399 it's considered stable and then the KD  <br>00:16:41.319 is like well you're not supposed to use  <br>00:16:42.759 it yet wait till like I forgot what  <br>00:16:44.600 version I'm like well you released it as  <br>00:16:47.160 stable so I'm I don't care if you're not  <br>00:16:49.240 feature complete but if you're crashing  <br>00:16:51.319 I have a problem and this is everyone's  <br>00:16:53.920 workflow now obviously I feel like KDE  <br>00:16:56.399 is great now I mean I'm sure they  <br>00:16:57.839 learned their lesson I have heard very  <br>00:16:59.319 many complaints lately but there's still  <br>00:17:01.399 people out there that might still feel  <br>00:17:03.279 that's the case there's people that  <br>00:17:04.520 think Ubuntu still has the Amazon icon  <br>00:17:08.520 and that that it's spying on them which  <br>00:17:10.280 wasn't true but they took that away a  <br>00:17:11.720 long time ago but people would swear  <br>00:17:13.679 it's still there it's like the once a  <br>00:17:15.720 software project in the Linux Community  <br>00:17:17.480 gets a bad reputation it's extremely  <br>00:17:20.000 hard for them to get rid of that and you  <br>00:17:22.359 see that with butter FS when they  <br>00:17:24.439 released 1.0 which was not feature  <br>00:17:27.160 complete now butter s probably won't  <br>00:17:30.000 have a single chance of taking over ZFS  <br>00:17:32.200 I think it's a great technology I'm not  <br>00:17:33.559 saying it's bad but but yeah it's it's  <br>00:17:35.960 wonderful but now that we called it 1.0  <br>00:17:38.760 it's got this reputation of the ZFS file  <br>00:17:41.320 system that barely works when all they  <br>00:17:44.559 did was call it 1.0 and I feel like once  <br>00:17:47.200 that happened development of butter FS  <br>00:17:49.600 slows down and the only thing I could  <br>00:17:51.760 think of is that it discourages people  <br>00:17:53.480 to hear all that backlash so one example  <br>00:17:55.880 I have right now is not specifically a  <br>00:17:57.240 Linux drro but that conversation  <br>00:17:59.320 reminded me of um I don't know who  <br>00:18:02.159 watching is um familiar with uh ice ice  <br>00:18:06.799 whale the zema board zema blade um zma  <br>00:18:10.240 Cube those zema products um wow yeah I'm  <br>00:18:12.960 not but I want to be at some point  <br>00:18:14.799 they're uh they're little like um sbcs  <br>00:18:18.240 or x86 they make a Zemo board and a zema  <br>00:18:20.760 blade they're like these little x86 like  <br>00:18:22.960 a Raspberry Pi that can boot from a flat  <br>00:18:24.720 from a USB key basically yeah it's just  <br>00:18:26.600 a little x86 N1 100 board and now they  <br>00:18:29.640 have a  <br>00:18:30.760 um they have a zma cube and it's a big  <br>00:18:33.480 nest it's like your sonology or qap it's  <br>00:18:37.039 just a and they developed their own uh  <br>00:18:39.600 little operating system for it called  <br>00:18:41.200 zma OS and they've been developing it  <br>00:18:44.159 for over a year but they've never  <br>00:18:46.760 released it as a 1.0 and I'm in the  <br>00:18:50.640 middle of reviewing one right now and it  <br>00:18:54.679 has a lot of issues but it's also not  <br>00:18:57.480 right a 1.0 so can't sit here and say  <br>00:19:00.080 you know this is bad like I mean I can  <br>00:19:02.600 say I can point out all the flaws  <br>00:19:04.240 definitely point but I can't say like  <br>00:19:06.520 guys this isn't a released product when  <br>00:19:08.640 it's released then I can give my final  <br>00:19:11.440 judgment on it as a whole and I feel  <br>00:19:13.919 like if more dros did that or with their  <br>00:19:16.280 features at least like this is ready  <br>00:19:18.520 this is stable we marked it as stable if  <br>00:19:20.640 you want another feature look at our  <br>00:19:22.400 road map we are working on it but I feel  <br>00:19:25.200 like that's not the case I think we need  <br>00:19:27.240 to have more people from a drro agnostic  <br>00:19:31.720 perspective catalog the hardware and the  <br>00:19:34.559 compatibility to have a drro agnostic  <br>00:19:37.000 compatibility database I'm not saying  <br>00:19:39.080 that that doesn't exist already I'm  <br>00:19:40.679 pretty sure that it does but we need  <br>00:19:43.559 something that is you know paid  <br>00:19:46.159 attention to that's being developed that  <br>00:19:48.679 is you know moving forward if we just  <br>00:19:50.919 had the one place that people could  <br>00:19:52.240 check then you know maybe you'll type in  <br>00:19:54.679 your Nvidia card and it might say works  <br>00:19:56.640 with a vuntu 2404 doesn't work with  <br>00:19:59.120 20204 and then it has that but one issue  <br>00:20:03.000 is we have all these distributions  <br>00:20:04.520 developing separately and that's not  <br>00:20:05.880 really a problem because they should be  <br>00:20:07.200 able to do that the whole point is to  <br>00:20:08.320 have a distribution of your own but  <br>00:20:10.280 they're also solving problems  <br>00:20:12.480 independently that they could help other  <br>00:20:14.440 distribution solve things that you know  <br>00:20:16.880 if if you're going through an issue with  <br>00:20:18.360 your dock on your  <br>00:20:20.480 distribution um if your distribution  <br>00:20:22.440 fixes it maybe they'll let another  <br>00:20:23.840 distribution know what they had to do to  <br>00:20:25.200 get that done and then the next thing  <br>00:20:26.480 you know if they Upstream it if it's a  <br>00:20:27.919 Linux kernel ISS you then it goes there  <br>00:20:29.400 everyone benefits but who's doing this  <br>00:20:32.960 you know like like we need we need  <br>00:20:34.440 someone like obviously we're expecting  <br>00:20:36.159 users to do it but they're not doing it  <br>00:20:38.039 yeah I think it's like a double-edged  <br>00:20:39.559 sword with Linux being so customizable  <br>00:20:43.320 and the fact that there's so many to  <br>00:20:44.440 choose from that's a good thing but on  <br>00:20:46.960 the other side you're splitting your  <br>00:20:50.840 developers and your talent into all  <br>00:20:54.600 these different pieces when imagine if  <br>00:20:56.679 you I know this isn't going to happen  <br>00:20:58.240 cuz it's not the nature of Linux or or  <br>00:21:01.159 open source but imagine if you just took  <br>00:21:02.799 those people and had a standardize one  <br>00:21:04.159 drro we're going to work together on  <br>00:21:05.919 just this one and we're going to make  <br>00:21:07.480 Linux yeah good for this one drro in a  <br>00:21:12.039 perfect world yeah that'd be great but  <br>00:21:14.039 that's not going to happen because the  <br>00:21:16.440 the reason people get into Linux is  <br>00:21:17.919 because they don't want to be forced  <br>00:21:19.279 into right a bucket they want that that  <br>00:21:22.159 freedom and and that was a big part of  <br>00:21:24.360 the you know the conversation here at 45  <br>00:21:26.520 drives we we talk about things like even  <br>00:21:28.919 during one of the meetings um PowerPoint  <br>00:21:31.840 froze for someone multiple times they  <br>00:21:35.039 we've had a update didn't we have an  <br>00:21:36.799 update window come up I could have sworn  <br>00:21:38.120 we did we had some kind of message come  <br>00:21:39.400 up a few different times and it was  <br>00:21:41.840 funny we were talking about how Windows  <br>00:21:45.120 is disruptive often to the users while  <br>00:21:48.159 it was actually showing disruption  <br>00:21:50.080 toward us while we were talking but  <br>00:21:52.919 that's kind of the main point that we  <br>00:21:54.240 get to when we say d Microsoft and  <br>00:21:56.480 personally my opinion is everyone should  <br>00:21:58.799 use the operating system that that works  <br>00:22:00.760 for them I want a future where someone  <br>00:22:04.360 goes to Best Buy and they see a Windows  <br>00:22:07.080 laptop they see a Macbook and they see a  <br>00:22:09.679 Linux laptop I want them to have a hard  <br>00:22:12.120 choice I want them to be there for a  <br>00:22:13.679 while and really have a hard decision  <br>00:22:15.720 because all three are just that good but  <br>00:22:18.320 the reality is um sometimes it's just  <br>00:22:22.000 hard to push something forward when  <br>00:22:25.240 other distrib all the distributions are  <br>00:22:27.080 each going their own Direction I feel  <br>00:22:28.600 that makes it tougher a lot yeah and  <br>00:22:30.640 it's I think we discussed this that was  <br>00:22:34.679 like we're it I think we were kind of  <br>00:22:37.240 split on this one where um feeling about  <br>00:22:41.080 the end user how much are they actually  <br>00:22:43.799 tied to Windows and we were like I don't  <br>00:22:46.320 think the end user really cares too much  <br>00:22:48.760 about the operating system as long as  <br>00:22:50.200 they're guaranteed that it'll work and  <br>00:22:52.520 and Linux hasn't proven that it'll just  <br>00:22:55.279 work because the connotation behind it  <br>00:22:57.720 is that it's weird because it's it's  <br>00:23:00.400 both it'll work on everything which I  <br>00:23:02.559 know isn't true but it has that kind of  <br>00:23:04.720 people say that people say that but and  <br>00:23:07.880 it doesn't work so it's got both this  <br>00:23:10.279 it'll work on everything but it doesn't  <br>00:23:12.240 work and it's it's so confusing that the  <br>00:23:15.200 average person they're never going to  <br>00:23:17.640 they're never going to use that over Mac  <br>00:23:20.320 or Windows if if that is the perception  <br>00:23:23.679 so and it wasn't a very popular opinion  <br>00:23:26.960 but I still stand by it that people  <br>00:23:29.000 don't like change you know if someone  <br>00:23:31.760 switches to Linux or even for just a  <br>00:23:34.279 little while because you maybe because  <br>00:23:35.760 you recommended it there's a very good  <br>00:23:38.159 chance that they're doing it because  <br>00:23:39.240 they love you they're doing it because  <br>00:23:40.559 they're supporting you they're they're  <br>00:23:42.200 helping you they're being a team player  <br>00:23:44.320 but changing an operating system is just  <br>00:23:47.480 not a mindset anyone has when they go to  <br>00:23:50.159 an appliance store they buy a fridge  <br>00:23:51.919 they don't care what's inside the fridge  <br>00:23:55.080 they just want their soda to be cold  <br>00:23:56.760 that's all they care about right so  <br>00:23:59.120 imagine if we go up to somebody and say  <br>00:24:01.120 Hey I want to change the operating  <br>00:24:02.480 system on your fridge it's going to cool  <br>00:24:04.039 your food better what um and I know  <br>00:24:06.440 that's a stupid example but if you think  <br>00:24:08.120 about it when you have a person they buy  <br>00:24:10.400 a computer it's an appliance they think  <br>00:24:12.279 of it like they're buying a stove a  <br>00:24:14.480 refrigerator a dishwasher they're buying  <br>00:24:16.360 a thing that does a thing and and that's  <br>00:24:18.960 all it is to them we come in change the  <br>00:24:21.320 operating system many of these people  <br>00:24:22.799 didn't even know that was something that  <br>00:24:24.000 you could do in the first place and  <br>00:24:26.520 they're going to feel anxiety when you  <br>00:24:28.440 recommend this because what you're  <br>00:24:29.960 telling them is I would love for an  <br>00:24:32.440 opportunity you know an opportunity to  <br>00:24:34.440 change the way you do everything  <br>00:24:35.919 wouldn't that be so cool yeah and then  <br>00:24:38.480 and then they don't want to get on board  <br>00:24:39.720 with it but um my opinion on Linux is  <br>00:24:43.240 that Linux on the desktop will only take  <br>00:24:45.919 off when a flagship desktop not marketed  <br>00:24:49.880 as a Linux desktop but does have Linux  <br>00:24:52.559 installed takes off then that would be  <br>00:24:55.720 something that could happen but it's  <br>00:24:57.799 just I mean look at Chrome OS like right  <br>00:25:00.880 Linux bace it doesn't say Android yeah  <br>00:25:03.600 yeah it's not Linux Android it's not  <br>00:25:06.039 Linux Chrome OS but it is popular people  <br>00:25:10.240 like it I wonder how how many people you  <br>00:25:12.279 think actually know that when they're  <br>00:25:14.000 using their Chromebook or their Android  <br>00:25:15.880 that it's based on Linux what percentage  <br>00:25:17.880 of people I mean I leg don't know I mean  <br>00:25:20.640 I really don't know but I I can't  <br>00:25:22.399 imagine that many people know or even  <br>00:25:24.039 care to know yeah so imagine yeah like  <br>00:25:25.840 you said if there's this third operating  <br>00:25:27.480 system that comes out out that looks as  <br>00:25:30.480 good as Mac OS and it has the  <br>00:25:32.600 compatibility of things with  <br>00:25:34.919 Windows people would be like okay I mean  <br>00:25:37.960 not overnight well I disagree I mean I I  <br>00:25:40.640 see your point but I feel like people  <br>00:25:43.039 will never switch to Windows I mean to  <br>00:25:45.320 Linux because they they're people are  <br>00:25:47.880 that averse to change it's really hard  <br>00:25:49.240 for us to understand this because we get  <br>00:25:51.880 excited when new technology comes out  <br>00:25:53.559 because there's new features there new  <br>00:25:54.919 technologies and things to learn but  <br>00:25:56.840 they don't get excited about those  <br>00:25:58.080 things things and I just feel like we're  <br>00:26:01.039 pitching something to a market see apple  <br>00:26:04.480 ships everything as you know I hate to  <br>00:26:06.120 use them as as an example but they  <br>00:26:08.279 they're very good at selling things  <br>00:26:10.080 they're extremely good at this and in  <br>00:26:11.840 marketing um how many times have you  <br>00:26:13.919 seen them Market oh check out our new  <br>00:26:16.039 version of  <br>00:26:17.399 BSD so many times right it's every  <br>00:26:20.200 commercial oh BSD o right no it's Mac OS  <br>00:26:23.480 they're selling a Mac computer with Mac  <br>00:26:26.559 OS and it it does well because they're  <br>00:26:29.360 selling a product meanwhile I feel like  <br>00:26:32.080 we're trying to sell an idea to people  <br>00:26:34.679 we should be selling a product yeah and  <br>00:26:36.679 I think it it's going to boil down to  <br>00:26:38.679 and this is getting further in yeah into  <br>00:26:40.960 the discussion but like you're used to  <br>00:26:44.720 like I said you're not you don't want to  <br>00:26:45.720 change so you're going to use what  <br>00:26:46.840 you're used to so how do we get the  <br>00:26:48.880 younger generation more used to using  <br>00:26:51.919 Linux if that's what we want to succeed  <br>00:26:54.840 moving forward if that's how we want  <br>00:26:56.600 Linux to gain more users but I feel like  <br>00:26:59.960 what's popular these days is you know  <br>00:27:03.279 this what you have in your pocket this  <br>00:27:04.760 is what people use as their main device  <br>00:27:08.600 so Y which I don't know is if that hurts  <br>00:27:11.880 or helps because I feel like when I was  <br>00:27:14.760 growing up we didn't have this if you  <br>00:27:17.360 wanted technology you got on the  <br>00:27:18.799 computer or went to the library cuz you  <br>00:27:20.799 couldn't afford it yeah and now it's  <br>00:27:22.640 like there's this distinct separation  <br>00:27:24.919 between my computer and my phone I may  <br>00:27:27.679 do more stuff on my phone but when I  <br>00:27:29.000 want to do something I get on the  <br>00:27:30.480 computer and now it's like well you know  <br>00:27:32.760 this is my phone and that's my computer  <br>00:27:34.399 if that's a Linux one then sure but I do  <br>00:27:36.840 most of my stuff here so I think one  <br>00:27:40.320 it's going to be a weird Next Generation  <br>00:27:43.679 10 20 years that's for sure I I can  <br>00:27:46.880 Envision someday the desktop completely  <br>00:27:49.799 dying and laptops being the only thing  <br>00:27:51.799 now now when I say this I want to be  <br>00:27:53.039 clear I do not see gaming PCs dying okay  <br>00:27:55.919 when I'm talking about desktops dying I  <br>00:27:57.640 mean for the people that don't game like  <br>00:27:59.279 the people that you know are are working  <br>00:28:00.880 in an office or you know their computers  <br>00:28:03.240 in Appliance they don't care people will  <br>00:28:04.559 still be building computers and buying  <br>00:28:05.919 video cards but I I do feel like at a  <br>00:28:07.720 certain point other than that the  <br>00:28:10.480 desktop is going to die and then as the  <br>00:28:12.760 portable devices which run Linux easier  <br>00:28:15.320 There's an opportunity there for Linux  <br>00:28:17.120 to come up with another device the  <br>00:28:18.679 desktop has already been one for so long  <br>00:28:20.559 it's really hard to to go back  <br>00:28:22.440 retroactively and win it this time but  <br>00:28:24.120 if you know we saw with netbooks Linux  <br>00:28:26.120 was there at the beginning and at that  <br>00:28:27.720 point a lot of people don't realize this  <br>00:28:29.320 a lot of people had a Linux laptop what  <br>00:28:32.559 happened tablets tablets came out  <br>00:28:35.640 everyone thought netbooks were going to  <br>00:28:36.919 be the thing it looked like Linux was  <br>00:28:38.880 actually taking off and next thing you  <br>00:28:40.840 know you know we have Android tablets  <br>00:28:42.720 that just we switched to that we  <br>00:28:44.240 switched to the the iPad and netbooks  <br>00:28:46.600 Fade Into Obscurity but what we saw was  <br>00:28:49.120 a new device form factor coming up Linux  <br>00:28:52.240 being there first and gaining from that  <br>00:28:54.640 popularity I think that's what we need  <br>00:28:56.559 this time yeah good example that we're  <br>00:28:58.240 seeing right now is the steam deck M  <br>00:29:01.039 valve gave the customers a feature and a  <br>00:29:06.080 reason to buy a product and the  <br>00:29:08.480 operating system was secondary you're  <br>00:29:10.519 buying this to game you don't care how  <br>00:29:14.880 it does it but it's running Linux so you  <br>00:29:18.919 know everyone's seen that spike in the  <br>00:29:21.320 amount of users using Linux just through  <br>00:29:23.480 Steam deck sales because of how popular  <br>00:29:25.440 it's gotten and I think if you can  <br>00:29:29.080 do that in a  <br>00:29:30.799 more I don't even know I don't want to  <br>00:29:32.600 say corporate world but more just like  <br>00:29:34.600 gener generic end user world like this  <br>00:29:37.960 thing it's super easy to watch YouTube  <br>00:29:40.480 and browse your mail and that's  <br>00:29:42.320 something I guess you see with Chrome OS  <br>00:29:43.960 I guess that's the appeal to it and they  <br>00:29:45.360 don't care what it is like you you give  <br>00:29:48.159 someone something they don't care that's  <br>00:29:49.399 Chrome OS they don't care that's Mac OS  <br>00:29:51.320 it it works so until L Linux  <br>00:29:55.240 distribution can get there right that  <br>00:29:58.640 is that easy for the average user on  <br>00:30:02.640 various different hardware and is  <br>00:30:04.960 compatible right with different  <br>00:30:07.600 hardware and I  <br>00:30:09.720 mean I I don't know I think he hit the  <br>00:30:12.840 na on the head and you know I feel like  <br>00:30:15.240 it's so Val valuable for me to hear  <br>00:30:16.919 about these things because you know I've  <br>00:30:19.279 been using Linux for 22 years right so I  <br>00:30:22.000 want to hear what people are going  <br>00:30:23.840 through today I know what people were  <br>00:30:26.679 going through when I first learned about  <br>00:30:28.559 it I know what people are going through  <br>00:30:30.320 as I read the news and study the  <br>00:30:31.640 communities and look at what people are  <br>00:30:33.480 saying but that's never the same as  <br>00:30:35.399 hearing it straight from someone's mouth  <br>00:30:37.000 what was their personal experience it's  <br>00:30:40.159 their personal workflow they decided to  <br>00:30:42.799 give this a shot and then they have  <br>00:30:44.559 something to say about it and that  <br>00:30:45.799 feedback is valuable yeah I mean a lot  <br>00:30:47.679 of people don't want to because a lot of  <br>00:30:49.320 the  <br>00:30:50.080 times if you Tred links and you failed  <br>00:30:53.159 you don't want to admit cuz you know you  <br>00:30:54.840 seem dumb like it's it's almost like oh  <br>00:30:57.000 I failed this thing I must have done  <br>00:30:58.200 something wrong I don't want to go share  <br>00:31:00.039 that with a bunch of people and some  <br>00:31:01.159 people do obviously there's people out  <br>00:31:02.600 there that are saying oh you know I had  <br>00:31:04.440 this issue you know why did I fail but a  <br>00:31:06.559 lot of people don't like they just like  <br>00:31:08.799 you said put in a live CD mess around  <br>00:31:11.799 with it it didn't work for me or  <br>00:31:13.440 something broke unplug it never try  <br>00:31:15.399 again never tell anybody like it just  <br>00:31:16.880 sucks if someone asks you oh did you  <br>00:31:19.000 ever try Linux yeah I tried it once it  <br>00:31:20.200 was terrible like that's but we also  <br>00:31:22.799 have to keep in mind too that sometimes  <br>00:31:25.240 the whole thing changes and is reversed  <br>00:31:27.559 when  <br>00:31:28.639 someone starts with a different  <br>00:31:30.399 operating system like like I knew  <br>00:31:32.200 somebody know somebody that started with  <br>00:31:35.200 Linux like you know when she's young she  <br>00:31:37.320 wants a computer whatever I have spare  <br>00:31:39.320 parts put it together put Linux on it um  <br>00:31:42.279 gave it to her seemed to like it a lot  <br>00:31:44.519 there was no problems because that's  <br>00:31:45.840 what she started with she never really  <br>00:31:47.200 had any issues she was not a computer  <br>00:31:48.919 person either like like she just learned  <br>00:31:50.720 how to do it and and that was that but  <br>00:31:53.159 she got frustrated one day when her  <br>00:31:55.480 friend asked her to help her uh put MP3  <br>00:31:58.240 is and an MP3 player it wasn't an iPod  <br>00:32:00.000 it wasn't Zoom it wasn't anything crazy  <br>00:32:01.679 it's just one of those that's a flash  <br>00:32:03.120 drive and it works on every operating  <br>00:32:05.080 system so it did work on Linux and  <br>00:32:07.320 windows so her friend has Windows and  <br>00:32:09.679 and I'm trying to walk her through it  <br>00:32:10.679 I'm like okay here's what you do you  <br>00:32:11.720 click on the start button you go to my  <br>00:32:13.559 computer and when you're inside there  <br>00:32:15.200 you should see like some kind of icon  <br>00:32:16.760 that represents your um your music  <br>00:32:18.840 player and and that's exactly what it  <br>00:32:20.799 was but she gets irate and she's like  <br>00:32:23.360 why did I have to click three times to  <br>00:32:27.159 go to my MP3 player this design is  <br>00:32:29.600 stupid and then she starts like making  <br>00:32:32.320 fun of my computer like who thought  <br>00:32:34.120 that's like I don't know but that's just  <br>00:32:36.039 the way it is and that's just and I  <br>00:32:37.880 don't really have an opinion here but  <br>00:32:39.919 what the reason I remembered this so  <br>00:32:41.399 well is because what I saw was somebody  <br>00:32:44.480 who didn't start with Windows or Mac and  <br>00:32:46.519 I got a chance to see what their what  <br>00:32:48.840 their world is like it when that's the  <br>00:32:50.760 only thing they have experienced with  <br>00:32:53.000 and and you get to see what their issues  <br>00:32:54.880 are with Windows um and I'm not going to  <br>00:32:58.440 say that's a very standard thing but I  <br>00:33:01.039 do feel too that the operating system  <br>00:33:04.080 you start with colors your mindset of  <br>00:33:06.720 computing to a point where it's really  <br>00:33:08.120 hard to change that later yeah that's  <br>00:33:09.720 hard cuz how often do you get the  <br>00:33:11.039 opportunity to talk to somebody whose  <br>00:33:12.880 first operating system was Linux not  <br>00:33:15.279 very often wasn't so yeah not like many  <br>00:33:18.919 people's was but I will say I guess if I  <br>00:33:21.559 had to offer two pieces two the two most  <br>00:33:25.760 important things I think are barriers  <br>00:33:28.519 for a lot of people getting into Linux  <br>00:33:30.519 and this is both from personal  <br>00:33:31.600 experience and from talking to people in  <br>00:33:33.000 my community is one is Hardware  <br>00:33:37.200 compatibility and I don't know how you  <br>00:33:39.760 solve that if there's some uh  <br>00:33:42.519 centralized database that has all these  <br>00:33:45.120 different combinations or if there's  <br>00:33:46.760 some type of Hardware compatibility  <br>00:33:49.200 check that you can there are yeah there  <br>00:33:50.880 there are already it's just that you  <br>00:33:52.360 know there's at least a few of these but  <br>00:33:53.960 they last I checked they they they  <br>00:33:55.519 didn't have the information I was  <br>00:33:56.639 looking for I feel like you know we need  <br>00:33:59.399 something new that that that's you know  <br>00:34:01.960 with some excitement around it some  <br>00:34:03.679 people that really want to help this out  <br>00:34:05.440 they are willing to have someone you  <br>00:34:07.519 know send in hardware for them to play  <br>00:34:09.599 with and then report back you get enough  <br>00:34:11.839 volunteers all over the world that are  <br>00:34:14.040 willing to do this and not just say it  <br>00:34:17.000 works and that's it no we don't want  <br>00:34:19.040 that we want like some details if it's a  <br>00:34:21.239 GPU did you try multiple screens what  <br>00:34:23.760 refresh rate did you get what what  <br>00:34:25.760 monitor you know what what resolution  <br>00:34:27.839 did you get and was that the native  <br>00:34:29.480 resolution of your display I mean  <br>00:34:31.359 there's other kind of things that we  <br>00:34:32.760 really do need to know and we need a we  <br>00:34:35.679 need something that's going to provide  <br>00:34:38.560 that to users that's third party has no  <br>00:34:40.960 distribution interest and it's just  <br>00:34:43.879 there for that um and that's just one  <br>00:34:45.800 way but I feel like we will solve this I  <br>00:34:49.520 I also feel like part of the reason why  <br>00:34:50.918 it's so challenging right now is Linux  <br>00:34:52.719 is in a state of transition in many  <br>00:34:55.079 different ways simultaneously the system  <br>00:34:58.720 the display manager Universal apps are  <br>00:35:01.960 being introduced along with  <br>00:35:03.640 containerization and immutable  <br>00:35:05.400 distributions this is all being  <br>00:35:07.400 introduced right now okay it's going to  <br>00:35:10.920 be a little there's going to be some  <br>00:35:12.520 some dirt in the room and some dust you  <br>00:35:14.280 know I think for a little while yeah and  <br>00:35:16.160 the the second thing I think is um just  <br>00:35:18.760 package management like it's when I go  <br>00:35:21.680 into a drro I shouldn't have to worry  <br>00:35:24.560 about if it's using snap or flat pack or  <br>00:35:27.880 if I need to go find the Deb on their  <br>00:35:30.400 website or if I have to load in the  <br>00:35:32.320 specific repository and use app to get  <br>00:35:34.640 it like there's so many different I  <br>00:35:36.680 don't know if you standardize it or if  <br>00:35:38.359 you make a proper UI for a package  <br>00:35:41.839 manager that isn't terrible like it's  <br>00:35:44.880 just so frustrating because in Windows  <br>00:35:46.599 it's pretty standard and Mac is pretty  <br>00:35:48.480 standard you download the app you run it  <br>00:35:50.800 it's installed here it's like even in  <br>00:35:53.599 you even when you do have stores and you  <br>00:35:57.640 search for something and even in in  <br>00:35:59.720 repos it's like wait which version why  <br>00:36:01.880 do I have I want to install Plex Media  <br>00:36:04.440 Server to run on my Debian um desktop  <br>00:36:08.200 just to try it out whatever I I I type  <br>00:36:11.000 in Plex there's like four different  <br>00:36:12.400 versions I'm like that's a that's a  <br>00:36:14.640 legit problem absolutely and I'm so glad  <br>00:36:17.040 you mentioned that that's that's  <br>00:36:18.200 absolutely true that's I think those are  <br>00:36:19.760 the two big ones that if you can solve  <br>00:36:22.160 those that is the two biggest hurdles I  <br>00:36:26.280 think a lot of new people to Linux face  <br>00:36:29.079 including myself because those are the  <br>00:36:31.920 main things you interact with your  <br>00:36:33.160 hardware and your software and if either  <br>00:36:36.079 one of those you have issues with it  <br>00:36:39.200 you're going to give up and that's what  <br>00:36:40.640 happened to me so have you by chance  <br>00:36:43.000 tried app Images along the way or has  <br>00:36:44.839 that crossed your radar I I I have I  <br>00:36:48.280 think that when I was running  <br>00:36:50.119 aontu is it used in it's used it's  <br>00:36:53.200 another so it's another there's three  <br>00:36:54.880 primary Universal package formats that  <br>00:36:57.000 are buying pred dominance we have flat  <br>00:36:58.880 pack snap and app Images app Images  <br>00:37:01.880 being a distant third but what I the  <br>00:37:03.319 reason I bring them up is because you  <br>00:37:05.560 know my opinion is mixed about them but  <br>00:37:07.040 what I do like about them is it's like  <br>00:37:09.760 the app or excuse me the Mac App  <br>00:37:12.760 mentality on Linux you download like on  <br>00:37:15.000 Linux you or Mac you download a app  <br>00:37:17.400 right you double click on it you can run  <br>00:37:18.920 it you can put it in any folder you want  <br>00:37:20.319 it doesn't matter double click on it you  <br>00:37:21.440 run it so an app image you it's aapp  <br>00:37:24.000 image file you double click on it it  <br>00:37:25.680 runs it has everything it needs you put  <br>00:37:27.319 it in any folder you want and you just  <br>00:37:29.119 run it from that folder and then you  <br>00:37:30.440 could do you know for example you could  <br>00:37:32.359 have your syncing solution like sync  <br>00:37:34.680 things sync your you know apps folder  <br>00:37:36.920 with all your flat pack or app Images  <br>00:37:39.000 update one and then your you know Google  <br>00:37:41.359 drive or whatever it is will get all the  <br>00:37:42.920 others updated but I like that solution  <br>00:37:46.319 because you know it does give you the  <br>00:37:48.319 ability to just download something and  <br>00:37:50.040 run it you don't worry about it um the  <br>00:37:52.800 problem is not everything's available  <br>00:37:54.319 that way and then there's no like then  <br>00:37:57.119 you got to go in and update them all mhm  <br>00:37:59.160 and then you run into the Mac situation  <br>00:38:00.880 that Mac users run into where you have  <br>00:38:02.599 to download something like mac updater  <br>00:38:04.400 because you have um on Mac you have the  <br>00:38:06.440 App Store there's updates in there  <br>00:38:08.319 system settings you have your your Mac  <br>00:38:10.000 OS updates in there individual apps will  <br>00:38:12.680 update themselves or maybe they won't  <br>00:38:14.560 but you're supposed to go in and find  <br>00:38:15.720 out if they didn't or not some so in in  <br>00:38:19.000 Mac you have a lot of issues but they're  <br>00:38:21.040 not nearly as bad as the Linux issues  <br>00:38:23.440 but even with Mac it's really cool that  <br>00:38:25.599 you have aapp file you run it you're  <br>00:38:27.720 fine and with app Images which I'll have  <br>00:38:30.079 a video out shortly we'll explain how to  <br>00:38:32.400 use them but I bring that up because  <br>00:38:34.960 people are trying to come up with  <br>00:38:36.359 Solutions but you know we're going to  <br>00:38:38.319 have to decide in the community you know  <br>00:38:40.160 which way are we going yeah and that's  <br>00:38:41.599 the hard part and I think like everyone  <br>00:38:44.400 loves like repos like it's so great in  <br>00:38:47.760 Linux like oh you want a software app  <br>00:38:49.680 install this boom you're done it's funny  <br>00:38:52.800 I hate repos it's an nonp popular  <br>00:38:54.560 opinion because when I first started  <br>00:38:56.480 Linux I I'll never forget this it was  <br>00:38:58.640 like the very first version of auntu  <br>00:39:01.839 ever and I was using um open Office on  <br>00:39:04.680 that and then you know I'm liking it so  <br>00:39:07.119 I go online and I I find the news that a  <br>00:39:09.359 new version of open office has just come  <br>00:39:11.000 out and I'm like well that's really cool  <br>00:39:12.520 because I want to check that out I  <br>00:39:13.760 really like that so I ask in the  <br>00:39:16.160 communities how do I get that how can I  <br>00:39:18.040 install that like it's available now  <br>00:39:19.680 like just wait for the next version of a  <br>00:39:21.240 BTU I'm like wait a minute you're  <br>00:39:23.560 telling me I have to wait for the next  <br>00:39:25.760 version M of my entire operating system  <br>00:39:29.359 to have the courtesy of upgrading open  <br>00:39:31.960 Office when Mac and windows users are  <br>00:39:35.480 able to go to the website and download  <br>00:39:37.240 it and and you know Libre office  <br>00:39:39.480 nowadays I mean and even back then they  <br>00:39:41.200 might have had another repository but  <br>00:39:42.599 that's not even the point the point is  <br>00:39:44.760 you're being provided a package in the  <br>00:39:46.520 repositories that may or may not have a  <br>00:39:48.800 third party P repository that's so up to  <br>00:39:50.760 date but the issue you run into like  <br>00:39:53.599 like Linux users I don't think we can  <br>00:39:55.720 tell Mac or Windows users they have to  <br>00:39:57.880 wait for the next version of their  <br>00:39:59.079 operating system for the next version of  <br>00:40:00.720 their software the straight phas and  <br>00:40:03.280 that's why I've always hated that my  <br>00:40:04.720 mentality has been your Linux kernel  <br>00:40:07.800 display drivers critical operating  <br>00:40:11.200 system components can be apt packages  <br>00:40:13.599 they could be RPMs and distribution  <br>00:40:15.400 repos all day long but once you get to  <br>00:40:17.160 the user layer we need user space apps  <br>00:40:20.119 out of the package management completely  <br>00:40:23.200 we should not have Apache in the same  <br>00:40:26.760 reposit atory as our Linux kernel we  <br>00:40:29.000 should be able to install Apache  <br>00:40:32.000 separately via Universal package that is  <br>00:40:35.079 independent of the package system and  <br>00:40:37.640 this is why we run into problems where  <br>00:40:39.160 someone pip installs something and then  <br>00:40:40.839 it blows away their package database and  <br>00:40:43.280 and then they want to continue to say  <br>00:40:44.760 that repositories are great I'm sorry I  <br>00:40:46.960 know a lot of people in my audience are  <br>00:40:48.520 going to disagree with me on this  <br>00:40:50.480 software repositories are not good in  <br>00:40:52.720 the way that they're being run today in  <br>00:40:54.440 my opinion yeah and that's inside that  <br>00:40:56.680 you know as a novice I have no I like  <br>00:40:59.280 that that's not something that crosses  <br>00:41:01.200 my mind I'm the end user that when I am  <br>00:41:04.480 so used to app install of this and then  <br>00:41:07.920 it's it is confusing cuz you know as the  <br>00:41:11.280 new person comes in you're like wait  <br>00:41:12.839 everyone's telling me to use app install  <br>00:41:14.520 to get this but there's a a package  <br>00:41:17.200 there's a store shouldn't I use that to  <br>00:41:19.520 install it right it's like no like but  <br>00:41:22.119 wait yes but what do I do it's it's very  <br>00:41:24.520 confusing so usually what I tell people  <br>00:41:26.240 going forward for now at least to try to  <br>00:41:27.839 make sense of this craziness is when you  <br>00:41:29.880 go into your app store or whatever you  <br>00:41:32.640 want to call it and you want to download  <br>00:41:34.920 something sometimes or at least a lot of  <br>00:41:36.960 times there's a drop- down it'll say Deb  <br>00:41:38.920 version flat pack version RPM version  <br>00:41:41.319 flat pack version whatever the case may  <br>00:41:42.800 be what I'll tell people now until we  <br>00:41:45.000 figure this out is just download the  <br>00:41:48.400 distribution package for now unless you  <br>00:41:52.280 need the newer version now one trick one  <br>00:41:55.160 tip I give everyone about Linux is you  <br>00:41:57.319 should never ever ever ever consider  <br>00:41:59.920 using the distribution version of Libre  <br>00:42:02.560 office that should be the first thing  <br>00:42:04.520 you install you should never open it you  <br>00:42:06.359 should never consider opening it you  <br>00:42:07.880 need to delete it and then after you do  <br>00:42:09.680 that you could get Libre office as a  <br>00:42:11.800 flat pack that is fully up to date now  <br>00:42:13.839 why am I asking you to remove this now  <br>00:42:15.760 here's the problem Libre office gets  <br>00:42:17.560 stigma people will say it's not as good  <br>00:42:19.720 as Microsoft Office and the reason why  <br>00:42:21.559 they say this I think at least in part  <br>00:42:24.359 is they have a very old version in their  <br>00:42:27.599 distributions repository that they have  <br>00:42:30.119 installed and since then lib office has  <br>00:42:32.520 been you know as they do they look for  <br>00:42:35.520 ways to reverse engineer what Microsoft  <br>00:42:37.440 is doing they fix things as they're  <br>00:42:39.079 broken they keep updating it and you  <br>00:42:41.559 need to be using a newer version of libr  <br>00:42:43.720 office to benefit from the continual  <br>00:42:45.680 fixes that they put into this but now  <br>00:42:48.240 because distributions are shipping this  <br>00:42:51.400 and they're shipping old versions I mean  <br>00:42:52.880 what version do we have in in Debian  <br>00:42:54.400 stable right now probably two major  <br>00:42:56.200 versions old I'm just guessing but my  <br>00:42:57.880 point is they open this up they get a  <br>00:43:00.880 Microsoft Word file from a coworker for  <br>00:43:03.680 example they get formatting issues and  <br>00:43:05.960 it doesn't look right and tables are  <br>00:43:07.880 broken and everything looks a mess I get  <br>00:43:10.480 the same file in the lib office version  <br>00:43:12.400 that's newer and it's fine but you know  <br>00:43:15.119 sometimes I think distributions have to  <br>00:43:16.640 realize that they themselves are you  <br>00:43:19.200 know making things harder for people  <br>00:43:21.079 yeah it's totally true so I don't know  <br>00:43:23.960 if we solved any issues today but hope  <br>00:43:25.680 we did hope we that's what I saying like  <br>00:43:27.960 throughout this whole week is like  <br>00:43:29.720 you're not going to solve all these  <br>00:43:31.079 issues in a day but it definitely takes  <br>00:43:33.240 you got to start somewhere and you got  <br>00:43:34.400 to have the conversations CU if you  <br>00:43:36.240 don't it's just going to keep going how  <br>00:43:38.480 it is and we've seen how it's going and  <br>00:43:40.480 obviously with linux's 6% desktop share  <br>00:43:44.319 if we want that to increase you're going  <br>00:43:46.240 to have to have conversations people are  <br>00:43:47.680 going to have to make tough decisions  <br>00:43:49.160 that some people don't like but you get  <br>00:43:51.800 some somebody's got to start making some  <br>00:43:53.359 decisions well we are the again we are  <br>00:43:55.839 the marketing for Linux we are the  <br>00:43:58.240 marketing the Linux Community Linux  <br>00:44:00.319 users we're we and especially YouTubers  <br>00:44:03.160 like ourselves we are the marketing you  <br>00:44:05.559 will not at least not now see a Linux  <br>00:44:07.960 related commercial on TV I haven't seen  <br>00:44:10.119 one personally maybe in some other  <br>00:44:11.359 countries where you know sus is more  <br>00:44:12.960 popular for example maybe that happens I  <br>00:44:14.520 don't know but we are the marketing  <br>00:44:16.920 which is why I put so much work into  <br>00:44:18.200 special effects in this channel because  <br>00:44:20.040 I want to position Linux in the best  <br>00:44:21.800 light possible because we all need to do  <br>00:44:24.599 that because if if we just need to do  <br>00:44:27.359 the best we can and and sometimes that  <br>00:44:29.000 could mean someone sees a problem and  <br>00:44:31.119 they want to step up and come up with a  <br>00:44:33.559 solution I encourage anybody in the  <br>00:44:36.280 audience share some ideas if you think  <br>00:44:37.960 you know a solution to this or even if  <br>00:44:40.359 it's in the form of new software you  <br>00:44:41.880 want to develop or or something that you  <br>00:44:44.119 want to not develop because you're not a  <br>00:44:45.839 developer but draw out on paper for all  <br>00:44:48.240 I care um if you have an idea I think we  <br>00:44:51.079 need to get those ideas to the people  <br>00:44:53.160 that can make that happen if that person  <br>00:44:55.079 isn't you and you know you know to  <br>00:44:58.319 actually put feet on the ground on these  <br>00:45:00.960 problems and get this solved and I I  <br>00:45:02.760 hope people in my community anybody  <br>00:45:05.480 that's complaining about something a  <br>00:45:07.160 valid complaint that's not something's  <br>00:45:08.800 not working do you have the time to do  <br>00:45:11.000 something about it do you have the  <br>00:45:12.599 expertise to do something about it if  <br>00:45:14.160 you don't do you know somebody that does  <br>00:45:15.920 do you know somewhere where this  <br>00:45:17.680 conversation can get started and that's  <br>00:45:20.000 what we need to do and I feel like we  <br>00:45:22.440 can we can get there but the Linux  <br>00:45:24.520 Community will be who decides that yeah  <br>00:45:27.079 100% and maybe we're back next year and  <br>00:45:30.000 things are different I hope so it'd be  <br>00:45:31.880 fun it' be fun to do a sequel to this is  <br>00:45:34.680 it better yet yeah that would be  <br>00:45:36.599 entertaining but yeah this was awesome  <br>00:45:38.800 it's good to sit down you know a lot of  <br>00:45:40.920 people their first impression of of  <br>00:45:42.720 Linux is bad and they get discouraged  <br>00:45:44.520 because they go to the forums and get  <br>00:45:46.280 that feedback but it's good to you know  <br>00:45:47.920 sit down and have a conversation about  <br>00:45:49.720 what your issues are without you know  <br>00:45:51.920 and and and talk about actual Solutions  <br>00:45:53.720 instead of just a bunch of angry  <br>00:45:56.520 comments and people screaming things  <br>00:45:59.960 that just don't help anybody so yeah  <br>00:46:02.800 like Jay said in the comments like if  <br>00:46:04.559 you know anybody if you have the  <br>00:46:05.680 expertise to make things better I'm all  <br>00:46:07.599 here for it I know I I had a Linux video  <br>00:46:10.800 where I failed but I legitimately am  <br>00:46:14.079 still using Linux I have the the laptop  <br>00:46:16.680 I brought it with me here it's what I've  <br>00:46:18.040 been using I'm still using Linux he's  <br>00:46:19.920 still trying it like like he's try he's  <br>00:46:21.640 he's he has he's doing a presentation  <br>00:46:23.520 about it meanwhile he's actively still  <br>00:46:26.599 right now I saw him just trying some  <br>00:46:28.200 stuff on Linux Mint with with your GPU  <br>00:46:30.480 issue so we'll be back next year to see  <br>00:46:33.760 where we're at but yes was this was  <br>00:46:35.720 awesome  <br>00:46:39.960 thanks and there's our video I hope you  <br>00:46:42.520 enjoyed today's video and this interview  <br>00:46:44.319 that I had with Brett it was a ton of  <br>00:46:45.680 fun and I look forward to collaborating  <br>00:46:47.480 with him again in the meantime subscribe  <br>00:46:49.720 to his channel if you haven't already  <br>00:46:51.119 done so it's under raid owl and also  <br>00:46:53.559 mine as well and you know what I really  <br>00:46:55.640 hope you enjoyed this let me know what  <br>00:46:57.079 you thought of this interview in the  <br>00:46:58.559 comments down below and I'll see you in  <br>00:47:00.400 the next video  <br>00:47:03.240 [Music]  <br>00:47:18.890 [Music]|### SUMMARY  <br>In a discussion featuring @RaidOwl, the problems with Linux and user experiences are explored.  <br>  <br>### IDEAS:  <br>- Linux's desktop share is only 6%, indicating limited acceptance among general users.  <br>- Many users face hardware compatibility issues when transitioning to Linux from other operating systems.  <br>- The perception of Linux as "weird" hinders its widespread adoption among non-technical users.  <br>- Community responses to novice questions can be discouraging, affecting user retention and engagement.  <br>- A lack of standardized package management contributes to user frustration with Linux software installation.  <br>- Users often feel overwhelmed by multiple package formats and repositories in Linux distributions.  <br>- The Linux community must improve its welcoming attitude towards inexperienced users to foster growth.  <br>- Many users abandon Linux due to reliance on specific software unavailable on the platform.  <br>- The need for a centralized hardware compatibility database is crucial for new Linux users.  <br>- Open-source software should prioritize user-friendly experiences to attract a broader audience.  <br>- Developers face discouragement from negative community feedback, affecting their productivity and innovation.  <br>- Marketing Linux as an appliance rather than a complex system could improve user acceptance.  <br>- The success of the Steam Deck shows that a compelling product can boost Linux usage.  <br>- Users expect seamless experiences similar to Windows or macOS when using Linux.  <br>- The diversity of Linux distributions can lead to fragmentation and hinder unified growth.  <br>- Conversations about Linux must focus on solutions rather than complaints to drive improvements.  <br>  <br>### INSIGHTS:  <br>- Effective marketing strategies should highlight Linux's strengths without overemphasizing its challenges.  <br>- User-first design principles are essential for software development within the Linux ecosystem.  <br>- Creating a supportive community can significantly impact the longevity of a user's engagement with Linux.  <br>- Developers should be encouraged to collaborate across distributions to enhance overall compatibility.  <br>- Standardizing software installation processes in Linux would reduce barriers for new users.  <br>- Community-driven initiatives can provide valuable insights and improvements for Linux distributions.  <br>- Simplifying user experiences on Linux can lead to higher adoption rates among non-technical users.  <br>- Open-source projects should aim for stability and reliability to build trust with users.  <br>- Emphasizing collective growth within the Linux community can lead to innovation and advancements.  <br>- Fostering a culture of patience and understanding within forums can improve user experiences.  <br>  <br>### QUOTES:  <br>- "Linux's desktop share is only 6%, indicating limited acceptance among general users."  <br>- "Many users face hardware compatibility issues when transitioning to Linux from

video what**0:19**we're going to do is check out app**0:21**Images an app image is a form of**0:24**software delivery it's basically an**0:26**all-in-one package a universal package**0:28**you download it run it and it's as**0:30**simple as that in this video what I'm**0:33**going to do is teach you everything that**0:35**you need to know to use app Images**0:37**you'll know what they are in the first**0:39**place how they work and why you might**0:41**want to consider using app Images over**0:43**other types of Linux packaging now if**0:46**you're not already familiar with the**0:47**concept Universal packages are a**0:50**relatively New Concept in Linux and the**0:52**idea is to have software being packaged**0:54**in a way where the drro doesn't matter**0:57**so that effectively means you could have**0:58**one application and it could run on just**1:01**about any distribution and this approach**1:03**is great for developers too because it**1:05**takes the dro out of the equation so if**1:07**someone is developing an app for Linux**1:09**then they only need to develop one thing**1:11**to Target the entirety of the Linux**1:13**community and then when it comes to you**1:15**the user you benefit because it doesn't**1:17**matter which distribution you run your**1:19**choice is respected you could use**1:20**anything you want and then you could**1:22**bring your applications with you and app**1:25**Images are one of three main types of**1:27**universal packages we have snap snap**1:30**packages flat packs and of course app**1:32**Images I already have videos in this**1:35**series on Snap packages and flat packs**1:37**so I'll leave a card for the snap video**1:39**right about here if you want to check**1:41**that out anyway I can't wait to dive inThe ad**1:44**but before I do I need to take a moment**1:46**and let you guys know that I have two**1:47**brand new courses available over on UD**1:49**to me first if you're in the process of**1:52**learning Linux for the very first time**1:53**you should definitely check out my Linux**1:55**Essentials course not only will this**1:57**course teach you everything you need to**1:58**know to get started Ed and learn the**2:00**basics of Linux it's also going to help**2:02**you get certified and earn your Linux**2:04**Essentials credential through LPI and**2:07**the Linux professional Institute is the**2:08**world's largest Linux and open source**2:10**focused vendor neutral certification**2:12**body so by earning certifications**2:14**through LPI your credentials will be**2:16**recognized around the world but even if**2:19**you don't have any interest in getting**2:20**certified this course is still a great**2:22**fit for those of you that are getting**2:23**started with Linux because it'll teach**2:25**you all the basics also I recently**2:28**released an anable course as well which**2:30**will teach you everything you need to**2:31**know to get up and running with anible**2:33**anible is one of if not the most popular**2:35**configuration and automation Platforms**2:37**in the Linux ecosystem so it's**2:39**definitely something that you need to**2:41**learn anible is a powerful and easy**2:43**tolearn platform that'll enable you to**2:45**automate even the most complicated Linux**2:47**Administration tasks and just like with**2:50**my Linux course each lesson will break**2:52**down even the most complicated**2:53**components and Concepts into easy to**2:56**understand lessons and by the end of the**2:57**course you'll learn everything that you**2:59**need to know know to use anible as part**3:01**of your daily tool set and as usual**3:03**thank you guys so much for supporting**3:05**Linux learning I really appreciate that**3:07**now it's time to dive into app images**3:09**and learn all about them so let's getWhat is an "AppImage"?**3:15**started so here we have an app image now**3:18**at first it doesn't look like much but**3:20**believe it or not this one file is a**3:23**complete application specifically Caden**3:25**live Caden live is an application you**3:27**could use to edit video in in fact I've**3:30**used Kaden live for many of the videos**3:32**on this channel before switching to D**3:34**Vinci resolve now this particular app**3:36**image I downloaded from the official**3:38**website so one thing to know about app**3:40**Images is that they could come from just**3:42**about anywhere often you'll find app**3:44**images on a developer's website when**3:46**they're making a program available and**3:47**it's not all that dissimilar to Windows**3:50**and Mac OS when you discover a new**3:51**application you download it you install**3:53**it but in this case we have an app image**3:55**so how do we go about running this well**3:58**the first thing we need to do is right**3:59**click on**4:01**it then we'll check the**4:04**properties and this might look different**4:06**for you depending on your desktop**4:07**environment but basically we want to go**4:09**to**4:10**permissions and we want to allow**4:12**executing as a program so I'll check**4:15**this right here and that's all we need**4:17**to do to make an app image work**4:19**seriously that's it so all we have to do**4:22**is just click on it like we would any**4:24**other**4:26**application so right here we have Caden**4:29**live how cool is**4:30**that now one thing to point out is that**4:34**I've created a directory called**4:37**applications it's very common when you**4:39**use app Images to want to save them all**4:40**in one place it doesn't really matter**4:42**where you save them you can even save**4:44**them in your home directory on your**4:45**desktop it doesn't really matter but**4:47**what I like to do is create a folder a**4:49**Parent Directory basically where all of**4:51**my app Images are going to live so we**4:54**only have this one right here so how do**4:57**we go about downloading an app image asHow do you generally obtain an AppImage?**5:00**I mentioned one of the most popular**5:01**places to find an app image is the**5:03**official website for whatever**5:04**application you're trying to install so**5:07**let's bring up a web**5:10**browser and here we have the browser so**5:13**what I'm going to do is just search for**5:15**bit**5:16**Worden then here's the official website**5:18**so I'll click on**5:20**that what we'll do is go to**5:23**download scroll down a bit here and you**5:26**can see that we have downloads for**5:28**Windows Mac OS and Linux so what I'm**5:31**going to do is click on**5:35**Linux and already I'm downloading an app**5:37**image seriously check this**5:39**out by default bit Wen is released as an**5:42**app image it's not the only way that you**5:44**could install bit Wen but it is a**5:46**popular way and it's available right**5:48**from the developer's website so we know**5:50**it's official we always want to make**5:52**sure that we're downloading applications**5:53**from official sources and it doesn't get**5:56**any more official than the official**5:57**website for the product so let's go**6:00**ahead and go back to our file manager**6:03**here and what I'm doing right now is**6:05**just grabbing it from my downloads**6:06**directory and I'm pasting the app image**6:09**into my applications directory and now**6:11**we have it so just like before I'm going**6:13**to right click on it I'm going to go**6:16**down to**6:18**properties let's allow executing as a**6:22**program we'll close it I'll just simply**6:25**click on**6:28**it and there you go bit Warden is now**6:31**running I didn't install it so there's**6:33**no installation procedure all I had to**6:35**do was download the app image make it**6:37**executable and I'm done and that's oneMore specifics regarding AppImages**6:40**of the main benefits of the app image**6:41**format there's no runtime or anything to**6:44**install or set up first you just simply**6:46**run an app image and that's it now when**6:48**you compare app Images to you know snap**6:51**packages and flat packs those formats**6:54**tend to be a little bit heavier now I**6:56**like all the formats don't get me wrong**6:58**I'm not saying you should pick one over**6:59**the other but what I'm saying though is**7:01**that there are clear differences for**7:03**example when it comes to snap packages**7:05**there's the snap store so when you want**7:07**to download a snap package in that**7:09**format you have to download it from the**7:11**Snap Store you also have to have snapd**7:13**installed as well so in that case there**7:15**is something that you need to install**7:17**first when it comes to Flat pack you**7:19**don't have to get flat packs from the**7:21**flathub App Store quote unquote App**7:24**Store and you do need to have flat pack**7:25**installed first before you can install a**7:28**flat pack but again with app Images you**7:30**don't have to install anything but one**7:32**of the bigger downsides of the app image**7:34**format is the**7:36**inconsistency for example earlier in the**7:38**video I downloaded Caden live and I ran**7:41**that when I did so it didn't ask me if I**7:43**wanted a desktop shortcut or an**7:45**application menu shortcut it just ran**7:48**and the problem here is if I check my**7:50**applications list it's not going to be**7:52**visible because it's not actually**7:54**installed and that kind of makes sense**7:56**because an app image is well just a file**7:59**there really isn't anything to install**8:01**so that's why we don't have a desktop**8:03**icon however some applications will ask**8:06**you if you want to integrate the**8:08**application which means create a desktop**8:10**or application launcher**8:12**shortcut now even though not every app**8:15**image will prompt you to create an**8:17**application launcher there is a**8:19**workaround and it's called app image**8:21**launcher and I already have it**8:23**downloaded right here I'm going to leave**8:24**a link to this in the description down**8:26**below but this is going to be a**8:28**distribution package this time note the**8:30**Deb format here in my case so when you**8:33**install app image launcher it basically**8:35**manages all of this for you so I'm just**8:37**going to install it right**8:39**now now the package is installed but**8:42**there's not really a whole lot to see**8:44**this is going to run in the background**8:47**but basically what that will do is**8:49**intercept the fact that we are opening**8:50**an app image so it'll see that we're**8:53**opening one and if a launcher isn't**8:55**already on the system for whatever one**8:57**we're launching it's going to give us an**8:59**option to create that so for example**9:02**what I'll do is open Kaden live**9:04**again and we see immediately that app**9:07**image launcher saw that we were**9:09**launching an app image and sprang into**9:12**action so right now it's going to see**9:15**the folder that we're currently inside**9:17**of and just assume that that's the**9:18**folder where all of our app Images are**9:20**going to be you could customize this and**9:23**you should customize this if you want to**9:24**put them somewhere else but that's okay**9:26**for me so I'll just click okay and right**9:29**now it's offering to integrate it for us**9:31**we could run once or integrate it into**9:33**our system run once is useful if you**9:36**only plan on running an app image just**9:38**one time but if you plan on keeping it**9:40**around you might want to click this**9:41**button right**9:46**here now we see that the app image is**9:50**launching and when I try to open**9:53**applications we can see that Caden live**9:55**is listed right there so as you can see**9:58**even though there's some downsides with**10:00**app Images there's some easy workarounds**10:02**to make it even**10:04**better now before I close out the videoAppImage Hub**10:07**I just wanted to show you guys one more**10:08**thing and that is the app image Hub so**10:11**even though there's no one app store for**10:14**app images and you could also download**10:16**them from the vendor's website most of**10:18**the time you'll also find app Images**10:20**here as well and this might be a good**10:22**place to start so let's click browse all**10:28**apps and and you can see that there's**10:30**quite a few listed**10:31**here now obviously I can't show you all**10:34**of them there's over 1,300 app images on**10:36**the site but if you're looking for a**10:38**good place to start then app image Hub**10:41**might be a great place I'll be sure to**10:43**have a link in the description down**10:44**below if you want to check it**10:48**out and there you go we just took a look**10:51**at app images in this video I love app**10:53**Images they're just so cool it's a**10:55**wonder why they're not more popular**10:57**hopefully this video will increase their**10:59**popularity because I think it's**11:01**definitely something that you should**11:02**check out anyway thank you so much for**11:04**checking out this video I really**11:06**appreciate it and I'll see you in the**11:07**next video**11:10**[Music]**11:25**[Music]English (auto-generated)[40:57Now

guys about spin right now**0:21**spin right might be an unlikely choice**0:23**for a Linux related YouTube channel and**0:25**it kind of is but the thing is this**0:27**application does have a use case for**0:30**Linux**0:31**users but what exactly is spin right**0:34**well spin right is a Dos utility and its**0:36**main purpose is to prevent and recover**0:39**from data loss and hard drive failure**0:41**respectively spin R is run from a USB**0:43**flash drive or CD so it bypasses the**0:46**underlying operating system of your**0:47**computer or server once booted it'll**0:49**give you a choice of a few different**0:50**types of scans or levels and once you**0:53**run a desired test against a drive you**0:55**simply wait for the results I'll talk**0:57**more about spin right's capabilities as**0:59**well as its pros and cons later in the**1:01**video now before we get started though IWhy make this video?**1:03**just wanted to mention that this video**1:05**is not sponsored by GRC the creator of**1:08**spin rate now actually I don't even know**1:10**if GRC is even aware that this channel**1:12**even exists I've been using this app for**1:14**quite some time and I decided a long**1:16**time ago to do a video about it the**1:19**thing is back then it was mentioned that**1:21**6.1 was being worked on so I decided**1:24**that it just didn't make sense to create**1:26**a video about something that was going**1:29**to just be updated dated so I decided to**1:30**wait and that wait turned into well**1:33**quite a long time but now 6.1 is finally**1:36**out and I decided to give it a review in**1:38**this video but perhaps the bigger**1:40**question though is why is the Linux guy**1:42**reviewing a Dos application well here's**1:45**the thing there's a great deal of Linux**1:47**administrators and homeb fans within my**1:49**audience when it comes to my home lab**1:51**audience one of the many amazing things**1:53**that they do is keep servers out of**1:54**landfills and that's awesome people that**1:57**are into self-hosting regularly**1:59**repurpose out ofate corporate equipment**2:01**all the time since servers that may no**2:02**longer be good enough for the Enterprise**2:04**are still plenty good enough for all of**2:05**you mad scientists out there now keep in**2:08**mind if you repurpose old servers then**2:10**you're also repurposing old hard drives**2:12**and that brings me to the first benefit**2:14**that spin right has for Linux users if**2:16**you purchase a secondhand server running**2:18**spin right on it before you put it into**2:20**production can only benefit you as spin**2:23**right can trigger error correction on**2:24**hard disk better than the OEM tools can**2:27**this way if there's any problematic**2:28**sectors on any of your hard discs it's a**2:30**good idea to have them detected before**2:32**you put a server into production not**2:35**after now for those of you that have had**2:37**servers in production for a long time**2:39**it's a good idea to run spin rate on**2:41**those every now and then maybe every**2:43**year or so that's just a personal**2:44**opinion on my side but it shouldn't hurt**2:47**you might even find that your Hardware**2:48**performs better after doing so I mean**2:51**your family can be without the Plex**2:53**server for a little bit can't they maybe**2:54**it's a good excuse to go**2:56**outside another use case for spin right**2:59**is for data recover recovery in fact**3:01**spinrite is one of three bootable tools**3:03**that I feel every administrator needs**3:05**the other two being mem test 86 and a**3:07**live image of your favorite Linux drro**3:09**now if you've potentially lost files**3:11**perhaps your devices and booting then**3:12**running spin right against the drive**3:14**might actually help you get your files**3:16**back it's possible that spin right's**3:18**airor correction might even repair the**3:19**drive but I figure if you have to go**3:21**through a bunch of work to get your**3:23**files back you may not want to trust**3:25**that drive any longer but I**3:27**digress data recovery features make spin**3:30**very useful in the Enterprise but home**3:31**users can definitely benefit from that**3:33**too now the way that spin right works ifWhat exactly does SpinRite do?**3:35**I put it very simply is that it gives**3:37**your hard disk a bit of a workout it**3:39**writes complex data to sectors in order**3:40**to test their read and write capability**3:43**and if there's a problem here the sector**3:44**will be marked bad and another will**3:46**replace it now to be fair so far that's**3:49**nothing unique even the manufacturer's**3:51**tools can do what I just described and**3:53**you can also do the same thing with open**3:55**source tools and there's probably a**3:56**dozen or so other ways I could think of**3:59**but the value of spin right is that it**4:01**tries really really really hard and**4:03**focuses very intensely on your disc more**4:06**intensely than even the manufacturers**4:08**tools generally do basically spinrite**4:10**has just one job and it does it very**4:12**well sorry to interrupt my own video butCheck out the updated merch shop! merch.learnlinux.tv**4:15**I just wanted to let you know that I**4:17**appreciate each and every single

really appreciate it now let's**5:03**get back to the**5:05**video more specifically there's threeSpinRite's "Levels"**5:07**different operating modes or levels of**5:09**spin right and the one that you'll end**5:11**up using depends on your needs level one**5:13**is a more basic read test that's not**5:15**super intensive but is good enough to**5:17**make sure all the data on your hard**5:18**drive is readable level two on the other**5:20**hand kicks things up a notch and**5:22**attempts recovery of any data found on**5:24**your drive that might not be readable**5:26**that's why if you want to perform data**5:27**recovery you might want to consider**5:28**starting here**5:30**level three is the most intensive**5:31**rewriting all data on your drive this**5:34**will help ensure that all data resides**5:35**only in sections of your hard disk known**5:37**to be within normal operation however**5:40**this test might take a lot longer to**5:41**complete if you want to check out spinSpinRite purchase and setup experience**5:43**right for yourself it'll set you back**5:45**$89 so this isn't free software but I**5:48**figure that the price tag is reasonable**5:50**for how useful it is and who knows maybe**5:52**someone within my audience will find it**5:54**useful once purchased you'll receive a**5:56**ridiculously tiny executable that's so**5:58**small you'll probably think think that**5:59**your download was disconnected but no**6:02**it's really that small this executable**6:05**will only run on Windows unfortunately**6:06**but you only have to run it once since**6:08**what it does is write spin rate to a**6:10**bootable Drive such as a flash drive of**6:13**course you can create bootable spin rate**6:14**media on Mac OS and Linux as well**6:17**there's an image file that's included**6:18**that you can use with your platform's**6:20**respective dis utility to create the**6:21**media now it's recommended that you use**6:23**the windows tool though but if you're**6:25**oppositional you could always write the**6:26**image**6:27**manually now before you go and thisThe downsides of SpinRite**6:30**though there are a few important**6:31**downsides to consider first in order to**6:34**use spin rate you'll need to modify the**6:35**settings of your host device in**6:37**particular what you'll need to do is**6:39**boot into Bios mode and also disable**6:41**secure boot now the author spin right is**6:44**quick to caution against disabling**6:45**secure boot unless you read the**6:47**documentation first so that way you can**6:49**understand if there's any other**6:50**ramifications of doing so generally**6:53**speaking you'll switch your computer to**6:54**Bios mode and disable secure boot run**6:57**spin right and then go back to your**6:58**computer settings and set everything**7:00**back to the way it was before continuing**7:01**to use it it sounds like a pain and well**7:04**it is but thankfully Steve mentions that**7:07**future versions will address this my**7:09**advice is rather than changing your**7:10**computer settings you could repurpose an**7:12**old desktop as a spin right machine**7:15**which you could do is power it on**7:16**disable secure boot switch it to Bios**7:18**mode and then leave it powered off then**7:21**what you could do anytime you want to**7:23**use spin right is you could take the**7:24**drive out of the device and just run it**7:26**from the spin right computer but that**7:29**might be overkill for some of you but**7:30**who knows thankfully though the biggest**7:33**downside has been addressed in version**7:34**6.1 for the longest time spin right has**7:37**been very slow painfully slow and this**7:40**is another reason why I was waiting for**7:41**the latest version to come out before**7:43**reviewing it it was so slow that it**7:45**wasn't uncommon for me to leave a**7:46**machine running over the weekend and**7:48**most of the time a scan would be**7:49**finished by the time it came back**7:51**however 6.1 has a Rewritten engine that**7:53**is much faster than before and I could**7:55**definitely notice the difference in fact**7:58**this is the main selling point of the**7:59**new version I received 6.1 as a free**8:02**upgrade from having purchased the**8:03**original version a long time back and I**8:05**think this speed boost more than makes**8:06**it worth the wait another potential**8:09**downside when it comes to spin right is**8:11**that purchasing it can be somewhat like**8:13**an insurance policy that you may or may**8:14**not find useful I mean think of it this**8:16**way you don't know ahead of time if**8:18**you're going to suffer a data recovery**8:20**issue and have to recover data you can't**8:22**really know that ahead of time so if you**8:24**purchase spin rate you're purchasing**8:26**something for a problem that you hope**8:28**you never have but if you do have that**8:30**problem then well you hope that it's**8:32**useful and whether or not it's useful**8:34**really depends on the problem that**8:36**you're trying to solve spin right is not**8:38**something that's going to fix every hard**8:40**drive issue if your computer itself**8:42**can't even detect the hard drive then**8:44**spin right won't be able to do that**8:45**either so we need to have you know**8:47**reasonable expectations here but as long**8:50**as we do that then spin right is really**8:52**useful that said I think spin right is**8:55**worth the purchase sure it's one of**8:57**those things that you hope you'll never**8:58**need and if you do need it you hope to**9:00**be glad that you did get it but aside**9:03**from that it's also good for**9:04**preventative maintenance as well and it**9:06**might even give you a performance boost**9:09**now let me know what you think of spin**9:10**right or any other tool that I mention**9:12**on this channel in the description down**9:14**below I can't wait to read what you guys**9:16**have to say in the meantime though**9:17**definitely subscribe to learn Linux TV**9:19**for the latest in Linux if you haven't**9:21**already done that and I'll see you in**9:22**the next videoEnglish (auto-generated)|## SUMMARY  <br>The video presents a review of SpinRite 6.1, a data recovery tool for Linux users.
