# RESTRAINT

## Once your employment ends, you agree not to solicit or attempt to solicit business from any client for the duration of the restraint period specified below.

## While the Employer acknowledges your right to work for a competitor and earn a living, it reserves the right to safeguard its legitimate business interests. Consequently, the non-compete clause restricts you from participating, either directly or indirectly, individually or in collaboration with others, in any business activities or ventures closely resembling or competing with the Employer's business. This restriction applies to the specific periods and geographical areas mentioned in the agreement. Please review these conditions carefully.

## You will not solicit, attempt to solicit, entice, or encourage any employee of the Employer to leave their engagement with the Employer for the restraint period within the restraint area.
