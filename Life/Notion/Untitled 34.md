Transcipt: "should we be frightened uh I think we should be a little frightened What do you tell the doomsdayers who are like \"Uh no AI is coming for us 50% of jobs in 5 years it's all gone.\" There's a lot of people I see asleep on this They're They're asleep on this Chuck They're not paying attention Do you think the roles we have now with like IT engineers network engineers will exist in 5 years um I have a question that's kind of been keeping me up at night Is there a future for network engineers in the age of AI like in 5 years are we going to exist that's why I'm here at Cisco Live the largest networking conference in the entire world And I'm asking this question I need the answer I'm asking Cisco people I'm asking network engineers who come here 22,000 of them hey what do you think about AI are you worried do you currently use AI is this a thing for you and let me tell you this year feels different for network engineers Everywhere you step everywhere you look AI AI AI The opening keynote Chuck Robbins AI G2 Patel AI Everything is AI So here we go Let's dive in Okay First walking up to Cisco Live the conference center AI everywhere Every sign every advertisement it's the AI era We're powering AI Every booth in the world of solutions had something to say about AI We kind of have a reason to be a little bit worried about AI In fact I just saw a Reddit post today where someone who had just gone to Cisco Live they're like \"Huh are we going to be okay?\" It's a very question I'm trying to answer dayto-day And by the way this video is sponsored by Cisco They brought me out to Cisco Live and they gave me the freedom to make whatever I wanted Thank you Cisco team You are amazing Now my first mission was to figure out how people feel about AI Are they optimistic are they scared um I can tell you that I touch AI almost daily for almost everything I do for work So AI how do you feel about it are you optimistic are you excited are you all in you get all in or you get all out How do you feel about AI oh I love AI I use it almost every day So really okay So you're optimistic about it oh yeah I think it's the future I mean everything's going to have AI in it going forward And if you don't learn it now you're going to get left behind So I'm optimistic Great I know AI has been around but in a different form than what we're used to right now right so AI now I think it'll actually enhance all of our experiences Right I'm optimistic about it I've used it for both college and personal like creating experience So you use AI now yep Um I know my colleague here is not so keen on it really I'm indifferent I mean I think it's neat for security and like medical stuff but right all the GPT and all that stuff It's neat but I don't care Now overall people seem to be pretty excited about AI They're optimistic They think that AI is going to make their lives better because it already has And I know for me it has in some ways and the more models that come out and the the better I understand how to use it it does actually help me with some things but not everything We'll get to that later Then I wanted to see okay network engineers IT people how are they actually using AI are they using it with their jobs and not just with their everyday life stuff with AI are you using it right now in your job i am How are you using it mostly for uh code ciloting and stuff that I don't want to do We actually just started about a year ago and we're actually going heavy into AI We're a utility company right so we're finding ways whereby AI could help us automate a lot of stuff that's you know done manually right now So I mean we talk we talk about about this all the time Um AI is an assistant to what you do And so you are the gatekeeper of what you allow AI to do or not do to your infrastructure Um we I think it's encouraged today to leverage that assistant next to you I know you and I when we talked first talked about automation back what five six years ago uh we were starting the whole DevNet thing and we talked about okay so is automation going to change the way I manage my network and is it going to take my job and and and and here we are we're just talking about automation as a skill as something that you should adopt as part of your tool set when you're working with your network AI is the same um my company we're we're trying to use AI where we can um I You don't want to rely completely on AI but it's a great starting point I mean I'll give you for instance I had to write a document uh really an ITIL document on that So okay I go to co-pilot C-pilot write me a document based based on ITIL you know give me a policy document So it gives me a policy document Okay make these changes making these changes gets me like 60% of the way there in minutes At that point now I can take it and do my own thing I wouldn't take that document and put it forward and said \"Here's my document.\" Right Right Don't do that but it's 60s something percent of the way there and now it's a really easy way to say okay where do I go from there rather than sitting at a blank page and going what do I AI is just another tool um and I've been talking this week a lot about ways that network engineers can use AI today to make themselves better engineers so an example I I I will sometimes go into is you're you know you've got some piece of knowledge buried deep in the back of your head but it's buried under dust and cobwebs and too many late nights with pizza um you could go try to dive through it or go into it But I like asking AI cuz I know if I see the right answer I was like \"Yeah that's the right answer I can dive in.\" So verification of information great use case for it Now speaking of using AI one of my first interviews I actually had was sitting down with John Capo Biano This guy is a ball of energy I love him Thank you for sitting down with me John He's a former Cisco employee but now he has left and he's working for an AI company called Selector AI I wanted to sit down with John because he's kind of at the forefront of networking with AI on Twitter He's the first guy I see messing with MCP agent to agent agent ops all those buzzwords And I asked him the same question Are you optimistic about AI why do you think it was that you were more excited versus like we're doomed well I see it as um like the computer is for human convenience Now I'm old I'm very old My first computer didn't come with a mouse Oh The mouse was a peripheral that was screwed into the back on a serial port And now I could move the mouse around Okay I know it sounds hilariously trivial and I'm really old but it's about convenience is it not mhm So now instead of menus and gooies and clicking and memorizing commands and I can use my own natural intuition and just sus out questions in a conversational way Now should we be frightened uh I think we should be a little frightened right there's with the great power comes the great responsibility but it's an opportunity Chuck I see this like like the protocols we just talked about MCP and ADA Why they've got me so excited is because they're protocols like HTTP or SMTP or spanning tree protocols Your code can work with my code because we're developing them with standards It's not the wild west anymore Right And it's very much like the late 90s mid 90s where protocols suddenly changed the world Right Right Think about HTTP hypertext transfer protocol and HTML What did that do for the world right it brought us online Yeah it did Yeah So now these new MCP tools are going to bring us even further with artificial intelligence So you're overall optimistic i'm optimistic I'm optimistic So of course obviously John works for an AI company He's pretty optimistic But I loved one of the last conversations I had with Hank Preston Now hint Preston if you don't know who he is he when I first met him he was the Python network automation guy back in 2018209 a big shift in networking was happening we as network engineers and admins were being told that we have to become developers in fact Susie we got to the stage and said hey you guys are developers now and that kind of scared a lot of network engineers including myself like are we going away is our job going away guess what it But Hank was at the forefront of that He had an amazing session that everyone flocked to He was like the guy those years and he was showing us how to start using network automation and Python with network automation This is a key thing I want you to remember We're going to touch on that later But one of the last things that Hank said to me and Jeremy as we were talking to him was that he said \"You have to be optimistic about AI What else are you going to do?\" And that's I kind of feel like where everyone is We're choosing to be optimistic you have to to wake up in the morning and continue on with this network engineering journey Now do we have a reason to be optimistic that's still what I'm trying to figure out The next thing I wanted to know is are these people worried so they may be optimistic about AI but are they worried about network engineering are they worried about their own jobs no I think the role is changing Back then networks were not what they I mean licensing what isn't what it is today So so you look at how networks has progressed since then It's the same thing I I think a network engineer that's saying like well I just you know I I build switches I plug that's not an engineer it's a jockey um that whole that whole job has changed over the years Yeah So now you think about like you know you look at catalyst center you can deploy switches very quickly So using uh using the tools in catalyst center to deploy how many switches right away Yeah that's true So so the job itself has changed and I think everyone understands that and they need to you know learn the new stuff and and move forward with that So one thing about AI is yes there might be job loss but also creates opportunity for you to learn new stuff and you know remain relevant So I'm not worried about that at all I actually embrace it I think it's going to be overall net good for everybody Yeah you know do you what's your take on AI as far as the job market goes do you think it's kind of scary like we're going to start losing jobs or what do you think i would say like 25% jobs of the current form will go away New jobs have come but it will not like gap all the beaches bridges but it will come different things So like as a current technology like here the tech expert I would say like people try to get familiar with it like the way we get oursel familiar with apps smartphones we should get familiar with it and get on top of it and take it like another cuisine right you are just trying out another cuisine just don't be afraid of it right so I don't think that networking as a career is going to diminish I think it's going to become more and more specialized more and more specialized to support you know high performance computing or GPUs or large language models in the data center Um I think we still have 3 to 5 years of a safety net I don't think that it's going to be that revolutionary and that fast Beyond 3 to 5 years it's really hard to project or predict I think the time for skepticism is behind us I think that everyone who is using AI has an advantage over people who are not using AI Okay Right And as we have this conversation if you're not using AI there are people are there are other people using it right and there's going to be a parody gap here And that is what I'm worried about are the people here that aren't using it that aren't paying attention that are going to wake up one day to a whole new reality that they're not prepared for Um at least today and and it some of this certainly will change as AI models get better Um but right now AI is not truly creative AI are mathematical models that are building on patterns and finding patterns that are there and giving you good information and it's fantastic at that And so one of the things that I think true humans are still necessary is for innovative ideas Um I'm also I try to be optimistic right the world is not for machines The world is for people and I think that we will recognize that there is still value in having people involved in the work not just the machines that are there Again optimism They think network engineering is going to be okay Many saying that network engineering will become even more critical as AI becomes more prevalent More data centers means more network engineers making those data centers work I like that viewpoint So I don't know about you but at this point I'm feeling pretty good I've talked to people at Cisco I've talked to engineers I've talked to engineers who love using AI and they're all feeling pretty good about it for now And that was my next question because right now AI is moving at a pace I can't keep up with Can you keep up with it it seems like every single week in fact just this week and I haven't looked at it yet or even played with it we had a new model 03 Pro come out So my question was in 5 years is the job of network engineer going to exist or system engineer IT engineer because in 5 years a lot can change I think they're going to change They've been changing Uh I think you're still going to have network engineers uh obviously still have managers like myself but uh you know the roles are going to be there but they're going to change because we have to change with the times you know uh you look at uh you look at cyber security you look at uh all the problems that are out there the bad guys are also using AI so they're getting quicker so we have to worry about that as well it it it's going to be different for sure yeah what's like uniquely human that you can do just that kind of thinking what's uniquely engineer right so you know you can't build a network unless you actually understand how networks network right right I mean we all know we've all seen networks where you're looking at that and like you're like who built that do do you understand it was AI AI built it Yeah You know so you know there will always be the need to be able to have a deeper understanding of how the network works Do you think the role of network engineer as we know it right now will that exist in 5 years it will We should be running the bots Oh definitely especially network engineers you know AI runs on the network so you're going to have to have the network there So I just see it making us uh more efficient you know if anything we're but we're never going to go away We're here to stay It's more of AI actually assisting actually seeing more visibility of the network and what's going on and give us more instead of working you know 12 16 18 hour days it actually allow us to work eight hour days Do you guys think that there will be a future for networking do you think the AI will take over networking uh I don't think so As it like I said as it currently stands now Definitely not In the future it's possible I think it's it's somewhere in the middle I think the the mundane tasks that we uh do daytoday are going to go away which means I don't need to SSH into a box I don't need to look at what's going on with my network that way I'm going to probably have an agent that do that for me But we talked about this like automation whether before AI you were supposed to do that anyway right with automation um do I think it's going to we're still going to touch the CLI I think at some level we will um it's going to probably be augmented with AI built into the terminal which I think it's out there today where you have your CLI you have an agent on your terminal that's helping you with commands I don't I don't know most of the iOS XC commands and I can't tell you how many times I go out to Cisco Docs or I go out to Google to search for it Now it's there So it's going to speed up It's going to it's going to make make me have superpowers um as a network engineer but I don't think it's going to make me obsolete I think that network engineer looks similar to the one that is today but they've in uh incorporated uh more security skills because again there's not a company I know of that wants an insecure network And and I I would also say someone that understands it not just from a network security standpoint but a cyber security standpoint understands red teaming understands pen testing understands blue teaming skills like incident response and threat hunting I also think that that's someone that natively understands automation I I I think that you know everybody thinks about AI almost like it's an easy button It's not If you really want to get the benefits of AI if you really want to feel them in your network you have to you have to automate more of your network uh operations and activities and that's going to be a big part of I think any uh CCNA CCNP CCIE engineer and what they're doing They're going to be thinking about how they can really drive that automation to get the benefits of AI Otherwise when I hear of people talk about oh it's all hype It's all hype until you really automate that network activity and I think that that's going to be a big part of the future work that our engineers are going to be doing Now this question I feel like had the most fun answers It became more practical for me For example Clark he said \"We'll have 8 hour days instead of these 16-hour days that network engineers are normally faced with Waking up and and getting those calls Maybe AI removes being on call Wouldn't that be amazing?\" Karine said that AI is going to give us superpowers It will augment us and make us better It'll do the things that we don't want to do And Josh reiterated that AI runs on the network The network powers it The more AI there is the more AI needs us Now my take on that I think it's optimistic and we have to be optimistic It's really hard to say what's going to happen in 5 years If we're honest with ourselves we will all say that we were all surprised where AI is at this present moment No one saw this coming I feel like we're going to be saying something very similar in five years And then I asked one more fun question It was a meme I saw on X or Twitter I don't know what to call it What do you call it still which side of the bus are you on and this assumes the premise that AI will eventually take half of all jobs Will you be on the left side where you're saddened by the idea of AI taking jobs you don't want it to happen You think people should be the ones working Or are you on the right side of the bus will you be overjoyed by the idea that AI takes jobs maybe we enter a postj job world Sure there's problems to solve Oh a lot more problems to solve with that scenario Where do you sit uh I'm the girl standing in the middle going it could do that and it could do that My jury's still out if you'll pardon the pun I'm somewhere in the middle Somewhere in the middle Okay Lots of jobs be happy to hand off to AI I'm on the AI's going to take all our jobs right okay And I'm and I am an outlier right like I I have my own unique uh take on this but it is it to me it being AI and large language models and natural language and chatting with the computer It it is like the promise of the last 30 40 years I feel like we've been on this trajectory and we're sort of reaching the operand of Mo's law and some of these right we're really starting to maximize our compute power and I I again I believe in a utopian outcome now whether or not we it's going to cost a lot of jobs I think that as yes some jobs will be displaced but you know two years ago there wasn't such a thing as a machine learning engineer right so new emerging categories of jobs will will come out Uh I would say for me somewhere in the middle um maybe towards the the left a little bit where is it is AI going to destroy half of all the jobs i don't think so And I I I want to say this and this is something that we we we overlook often which is humans engineers um network engineers have this thing that AI doesn't have which is critical thinking and so you built your critical thinking uh skills from learning from uh troubleshooting networks from experience right that AI does does not have the capability to do that critical thinking skills Now I think I'm somewhere in the middle as well There are jobs in history that don't exist anymore and should not exist Like lamplighters That was a popular example that the CEO of Anthropic used when he was talking about \"Hey wake up Jobs might be taken In 2 to 3 years we might see 50% of jobs gone.\" But also I think that we need to work People need to work People need purpose We should never remove people from these jobs AI should always be there to help us but never replace us And that's a common theme I heard many many times throughout talking with everyone in all these interviews is that AI isn't going to replace you but someone using AI will But then John Capo Biano and he comes in with the craziest notion and many people do hold this view He was fully on the right side of the bus And then the keynote happened The opening keynote at Cisco Live is where they announced all the crazy stuff they're doing And shocker they talked about AI a lot Chuck Robbins opened with saying that the AI race is on We have to move forward We have to be quick because everyone is trying to have the best AI We have to make it secure We have to make it the best We all know that every company every organization every government around the world There's also a defensive mechanism There's a FOMO element about what are you doing in AI and I agree There's no stopping it The only thing we can do now is sprint forward as fast as we can I get that And then G2 Patel took the stage One thing he said stood out to me With the help of agents or AI we can take the 8 billion people in the world and augment them in a way to where we have a throughput a workforce throughput of 80 billion people So 8 billion humans will feel like we have the throughput capacity of 80 billion humans He then went on to say that we're going to have a different looking workforce We'll have humans of course maybe but we'll also have AI agents AI apps robotics and humanoids That's terrifying but it's going to happen And then they announced something pretty cool and also pretty terrifying They announced their own purpose-built AI model for networking It's called the deep network model It's been trained on a ton of networking related data and tasks And similar to how they benchmark other AI LLMs on coding task this one they gave it a CCIE test labs and exam and it performed 20% better than the other leading LLM models They actually announced something similar at RSA conference but it was security focused I think it was called the security foundation model I did try it out It was okay But then Cisco showed us something pretty crazy They're putting AI in the data center and they're doing it with a thing called AI canvas It's a new control panel that's all about AI it's AI first and they gave a demo in which this guy was troubleshooting a connectivity error and this demo was live real time and he simply just chatted with this interface which I believe was the deep network model and it started doing things that man humans just can't do It's multimodal so it was generating graphs and charts about the network in real time Graphs and charts that we could drag on over to the main canvas real time dashboard creation which honestly is amazing But then they showed one more terrifying thing They had the model figure out a configuration like produce a QoS policy or a cost policy for me quality of service and then he asked it to apply this policy So at this point this is something a network engineer would have done We would have gotten into the routers the switches wherever this QoS policy would need to be applied We would have troubleshooted it figured out the configuration and applied it The AI did this for the guy operating this I forgot his name And all he had to do was just tell it his intent What do you wanted to happen in regular human language not CLI speak like we spend so long learning when we're studying for the CCNA and CCMP which brought me to a conversation I had with Kareem Escander and Joe Clark Kareem is part of the team that actually brought me out to Cisco Thank you Kareem How do you teach them to use AI and then make sure they're using it right how do you have a CCNA exam that's measuring if they're using AI effectively along with troubleshooting a network one of the ways we we think we can do this well first of all we might have to reconsider how we evaluate exams So in the real world you would have Google you would have chat GPT Instead of doing a lot of multiple choice memorization like you just said imagine if your exam allows you access to an LLM allows you access to a search and instead of multiple choice you're dropped onto a web portal for Moroi or you're dropped into a CLI and you actually when it says configure when it says implement you have to configure you have to implement The second part of your question is towards how do you get them to think critically about what AI is coming back with We think there's an opportunity to present them with um artifacts like this is the topology diagram of the network These are the configurations of the network This is the prompt and this is what the LLM said What do you think is the right answer what do you think is the most accurate response the AI has given you and if they've studied if they've prepared if they've played with some of that LLM with something like Cisco modeling labs in a simulated environment they should be able to answer that They should be able to say \"Ah you can't do that interface there.\" Or it says \"We're not allowed to run this protocol in our network so I can't trust that answer It has to be this answer.\" So what we're seeing right now is people say \"You need to learn AI You still need to learn the CCNA but you need to learn all the new tools.\" A big focus that Joe mentioned was learning how to interpret the results of an AI So when you're talking with an LLM and being able to see if it's giving you bad data or it's hallucinating Okay so let's close this up I came to Cisco Live to figure out is there a future for network engineers this year We had an attendance of 22,000 people 22,000 people that care about networking that were there to learn about networking to kind of get a forecast for the future What are we supposed to be learning the overall take of many people I talked with was they're optimistic They're using AI every day in their job and they're actually excited about how it's going to make their lives easier their jobs easier Some are honest and saying \"Yeah it might take away some jobs but it won't take away the jobs of people who adapt who learn and use AI in their current roles.\" Now I know in many roles I've had we've been understaffed We needed more people but we couldn't find them So I totally understand the appeal of having an AI buddy to augment your staff I just hope it doesn't go too far to where they realize suddenly they don't need me either But I will say this I was so encouraged being at this conference because what I saw was still a strong desire to learn networking People are still tons of people are still going for their CCNA their CCMP Everyone's excited about learning that next new thing and they're also excited about learning the basics IP addressing subnetting OPF EIGRP For the time being no matter how good AI gets we need people who know those protocols so we can tell AI when it's being dumb But reality check real change is coming and we need to be ready to adapt You need to adapt now If you haven't already started playing with AI you need to become very familiar with it I think the best thing you can do for yourself right now is just ask yourself how can AI help me do my current job better also get in community Talk with your fellow engineers and see what they're doing But also take comfort in this This is no different than anything we've ever encountered in it We've always had to learn and adapt to the new technologies that come up The people who don't adapt they do get left behind We had traditional telefan migrate to voiceover IP We saw the big change with network automation going from manually configuring a switch a switch a switch with CLI to configuring thousands all at once with automation One might say that AI is simply another iteration the next generation of automation And as far as what network engineers will be doing in the future I think that's probably it It will not be getting in the weeds as much as we are right now dealing with outages and and looking through logs It'll be how can I make the network better how can I automate more of the stuff we already have and in 5 years who knows you can't know Be optimistic Keep studying And from what we can see the world needs network engineers And we have a shortage and more AI is being built and we got to help power it Now I want to know what you think The questions I asked I would love to have those put in the comments below That's all I got I'll catch you guys next "
