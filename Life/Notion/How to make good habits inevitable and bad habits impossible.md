### How to automate a habit and never think about it again

  

==**The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act**==

  

==**Technology can transform actions that were once hard, annoying, and complicated into behaviours that are easy, painless, and simple. It is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behaviour**==

  

==**When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet.**==

  

==**Each habit that we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth**==

  

==**Remove the mental candy from your environment and it’ll become much easier to eat the healthy stuff**==

  

==**When working in your favour, automation can make your good habits inevitable and your bad habits impossible. It is the ultimate way to lock in future behaviour rather than relying on willpower in the moment.**==

  

==**By utilizing commitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and technology, you can create an environment of inevitability, a space where good habits are not just an outcome you hope for but an outcome that is virtually guaranteed.**==
