why well  <br>00:00:04.880 I've been stuck in the past failing to  <br>00:00:06.759 see how easily notion Ai and some other  <br>00:00:09.240 quick shortcut features can massively  <br>00:00:11.480 Save Us hours and optimize our workflow  <br>00:00:14.480 now like me you might have been dubious  <br>00:00:16.520 as to how usable AI actually was in  <br>00:00:18.920 notion after hours of experimenting  <br>00:00:21.279 these are the best ways to use it that  <br>00:00:23.519 actually work saving you time and  <br>00:00:25.720 improving the quality of your work in  <br>00:00:28.000

second brain both easier to use  <br>00:00:41.360 and more powerful I mean these days it  <br>00:00:43.559 can even talk to you stick around for  <br>00:00:45.640 that and thank you to short form my  <br>00:00:47.840 other secret productivity tool for  <br>00:00:50.079 sponsoring this video this first one is  <br>00:00:53.039 a very exciting Discovery for me the new  <br>00:00:55.640 AI database properties are great and can  <br>00:00:58.199 help you a huge amount but often feel a  <br>00:01:00.440 bit generic and meaningless when used as  <br>00:01:03.039 a simple summary unless you Embrace how  <br>00:01:05.640 to customize them let me show you then  <br>00:01:07.720 some amazing examples that have been big  <br>00:01:09.880 news for me with how I've been using  <br>00:01:12.400 notion AI to manage my YouTube video  <br>00:01:14.920 creation from scripting through to  <br>00:01:16.680 managing projects with collaborators so  <br>00:01:19.000 if we click to my content manager you'll  <br>00:01:21.360 see all of my current videos including  <br>00:01:23.280 the one we're working on and this is  <br>00:01:24.720 where I run my channel now at the moment  <br>00:01:26.720 I'm working on creating a help Bop for  <br>00:01:29.479 my life OS template users to assist them  <br>00:01:32.200 something that can direct people to the  <br>00:01:33.960 relevant notion videos in my library  <br>00:01:36.439 which is here that link to specific  <br>00:01:38.399 templates I mentioned for example right  <br>00:01:40.560 down here I have all of my published  <br>00:01:43.119 videos with the links notion AI has  <br>00:01:45.680 helped this massively in the content  <br>00:01:47.799 manager so if we click on my simplified  <br>00:01:50.159 notion life OS tour you'll see that I  <br>00:01:52.159 have here a AI content summary tool this  <br>00:01:56.360 was generated by AI it is summarizing  <br>00:01:59.280 the title of the video it's putting the  <br>00:02:00.880 URL an intro to what happens talking  <br>00:02:03.399 about what I cover and saying why people  <br>00:02:05.600 should watch if I click in here and we  <br>00:02:07.880 edit the property we have an AI autofill  <br>00:02:11.200 and within this I can list a custom  <br>00:02:13.720 autofill so please do the following  <br>00:02:16.000 write the video title and URL then  <br>00:02:18.000 summarize the content of the following  <br>00:02:19.720 sections and then finally a subheading  <br>00:02:21.840 of why to watch and share some  <br>00:02:23.440 information on why people might enjoy  <br>00:02:25.080 watching it so what that's actually  <br>00:02:26.480 doing is down here we have in scripting  <br>00:02:29.680 we have the hook and setup here that I  <br>00:02:32.120 wrote as a script and we have a list of  <br>00:02:34.480 everything that I cover in the video  <br>00:02:36.440 planned out when I did my tour of this  <br>00:02:38.959 simplified life OS that I made and it  <br>00:02:41.200 summarized all of those details I've  <br>00:02:43.480 also created a property which is a  <br>00:02:45.879 custom auto and I've listed in here what  <br>00:02:48.959 to generate you're an expert in SEO  <br>00:02:50.959 create a YouTube description for the  <br>00:02:53.640 video and it can actually generate  <br>00:02:55.720 things as well let's give it a go you'll  <br>00:02:57.360 see it is writing out the video title  <br>00:03:00.519 it's suggested some sections and it's  <br>00:03:02.680 given me some keywords that is a huge  <br>00:03:04.560 amount of work for me normally which I  <br>00:03:06.239 can now work from in that video and I'm  <br>00:03:09.040 ready to rock so if you wanted to do  <br>00:03:11.040 this you would simply create whatever  <br>00:03:13.280 database that you want you would select  <br>00:03:15.480 a new property and you have these  <br>00:03:17.280 options up here for AI keywords  <br>00:03:19.440 translation custom autofill and AI  <br>00:03:21.560 summary I think this one is really  <br>00:03:23.440 powerful so if in my content manager I  <br>00:03:25.519 wanted to add a new one let's say I  <br>00:03:27.120 wanted keywords for each I could select  <br>00:03:29.159 the AI keywords option can see more  <br>00:03:31.680 details about it what to  <br>00:03:33.599 generate let's try  <br>00:03:35.640 it and you can see in here we now have  <br>00:03:38.680 if I wrap the column a list of keywords  <br>00:03:41.879 so this could be great in a larger  <br>00:03:43.560 system maybe you'd want to use it in a  <br>00:03:45.120 journal and you could add in keywords  <br>00:03:47.519 into the system and do it all  <br>00:03:49.040 automatically but even more remarkable  <br>00:03:50.959 for a while I found that notion AI could  <br>00:03:53.280 actually go further than this so if I  <br>00:03:55.040 open up this iPad accessories video  <br>00:03:57.200 there's my content summary as we've set  <br>00:03:59.519 but below it I've got this a final video  <br>00:04:02.480 description and it seemed strangely that  <br>00:04:05.159 it would reach outside the system it has  <br>00:04:07.400 since weirdly stopped working so this is  <br>00:04:09.480 an unconfirmed bit of info and in fact  <br>00:04:11.920 occasionally notion AI has raised an  <br>00:04:13.560 error saying it couldn't look at  <br>00:04:15.200 external URLs but take a look at this  <br>00:04:17.358 example what I've done with this if we  <br>00:04:19.399 look at the property final video  <br>00:04:21.079 description it says using the URL  <br>00:04:23.479 property link please find the video  <br>00:04:25.280 description for that link on YouTube and  <br>00:04:27.600 share the text from that video descript  <br>00:04:29.680 description in this property and it's  <br>00:04:31.600 genuinely done that this is the  <br>00:04:33.720 description for my video listing  <br>00:04:36.440 everything into it including all of my  <br>00:04:38.360 links to the products if I now jump to  <br>00:04:40.759 the YouTube page there it all is there  <br>00:04:43.720 is all the information that we listed in  <br>00:04:46.639 it so leave me a comment below if you  <br>00:04:48.440 found any other unexpected use cases and  <br>00:04:51.240 do give this a go and let me know if it  <br>00:04:52.880 works for you I've also used the key  <br>00:04:54.960 info option to list key topics on my  <br>00:04:57.280 clippings and notes pages and love the  <br>00:04:59.800 summary feature for journaling templates  <br>00:05:02.479 to Summarize each entry in a gallery  <br>00:05:04.960 view so I've been using this in my  <br>00:05:07.039 notion Essentials template so I've got  <br>00:05:09.160 all these different templates you can  <br>00:05:10.720 put the template in fill it out and then  <br>00:05:13.160 you will see the summary of what you've  <br>00:05:14.560 written in here but for example maybe  <br>00:05:16.680 you wanted to create a AI categories  <br>00:05:18.639 thing we could add a property here new  <br>00:05:20.840 property and we'll do AI keywords multi  <br>00:05:25.680 select and let's call this AI category  <br>00:05:30.680 something like that save the changes try  <br>00:05:34.080 on this page and if we now show it in  <br>00:05:36.639 here there you go it's coming up and you  <br>00:05:38.800 can add really quickly AI keyword  <br>00:05:41.680 summaries into the system you can check  <br>00:05:43.840 out my notion Essentials templates via  <br>00:05:45.960 the link below if you want to try any of  <br>00:05:47.840 these out now use case number two for  <br>00:05:49.639 you life OS and second brain users is  <br>00:05:51.880 that these summary properties get even  <br>00:05:53.840 cooler if we use AI from notion  <br>00:05:57.759 alongside save to notion to summarize  <br>00:06:00.400 clipping so if we jump to a web page you  <br>00:06:04.000 can download the Chrome extension for  <br>00:06:05.600 save to notion and you can create these  <br>00:06:07.360 forms right which are rather good and  <br>00:06:09.400 it'll link things in and include stuff  <br>00:06:11.440 in so what I want to do is I'm going to  <br>00:06:13.000 add a new property to that database add  <br>00:06:15.800 a new property and we'll make that a  <br>00:06:18.680 simple AI  <br>00:06:20.840 summary how about this summarize in  <br>00:06:23.800 bullet points the key information and  <br>00:06:25.720 lessons from the page material and  <br>00:06:27.840 reference any other possible page pages  <br>00:06:29.840 in my workspace that could be relevant  <br>00:06:31.520 to it so I'm going to save that there  <br>00:06:34.120 and what we'll do is we'll jump to here  <br>00:06:37.639 back to our page and our save to notion  <br>00:06:40.199 option I'm going to add a new field in  <br>00:06:42.240 here and I'm going to find the AI  <br>00:06:44.759 summary option there it is and we want  <br>00:06:47.280 to put all of the  <br>00:06:48.800 content web page content is going to go  <br>00:06:51.120 in and I'm going to save it so it's web  <br>00:06:53.120 page content it's all ready to go and  <br>00:06:55.479 maybe I will give this a status of on  <br>00:06:58.160 reading list so I can up up date it all  <br>00:07:00.039 in there then you save it to your  <br>00:07:02.879 workspace and now if we jump back there  <br>00:07:05.000 it is so there's all the information if  <br>00:07:06.800 we then get that to do its thing it  <br>00:07:09.240 summarizes everything within that page  <br>00:07:11.759 this is a brilliant use of AI to clean  <br>00:07:14.680 up the way you look at your information  <br>00:07:17.120 so notion AI is $10 for the add-on but  <br>00:07:20.680 if you see the value that is an amazing  <br>00:07:22.879 deal okay so that's cool but we can go  <br>00:07:25.800 further and actually talk to your  <br>00:07:27.879 workspaces to explore all the knowledge  <br>00:07:30.479 within them more on that later in the  <br>00:07:32.560 video but first let's look at a few of  <br>00:07:35.120 the latest quick and simple tricks that  <br>00:07:37.240 I've found that can also speed up how  <br>00:07:40.080 you use notion not just AI so my  <br>00:07:43.240 favorite new feature has got to be this  <br>00:07:45.599 if I go into my sidebar and I want to  <br>00:07:48.319 open something in a new tab press  <br>00:07:50.080 command and then click it and it opens  <br>00:07:53.039 it in a new tab that is super brilliant  <br>00:07:56.479 and on that note if I want to reference  <br>00:07:58.280 a page ever or get the link for it  <br>00:08:00.319 command L will copy it to your clipboard  <br>00:08:03.440 so that means if I go back into here  <br>00:08:05.479 command V mention the page you can very  <br>00:08:07.879 quickly create yourself a little menu  <br>00:08:10.159 using at mentions or this is just a  <br>00:08:12.440 great way to share pages with people  <br>00:08:14.319 that you're working with and finally on  <br>00:08:15.919 this list is number three AI tables and  <br>00:08:18.639 databases this one up here was created  <br>00:08:21.759 by creating a simple table and then  <br>00:08:24.639 turning it into a database so to  <br>00:08:27.199 shortcut that first part of the building  <br>00:08:29.560 process when you want to get a new  <br>00:08:31.319 bespoke nation database created this is  <br>00:08:33.880 a fantastic trick the quickest way to  <br>00:08:35.760 get into AI is just to press space and I  <br>00:08:38.320 can write what I want so I might say  <br>00:08:40.360 create a table of the top classic  <br>00:08:45.360 motorcycles from the UK and  <br>00:08:49.200 Europe let's see what that does there it  <br>00:08:52.080 goes year release best features  <br>00:08:53.519 reference URL it's creating the table  <br>00:08:56.080 and filling it out of course you would  <br>00:08:58.000 want to probably do a little bit more  <br>00:09:00.079 work on this yourself but look how fast  <br>00:09:02.440 it's creating this let's say it's done  <br>00:09:05.000 I'm then going to click on the side  <br>00:09:06.240 panel here click turn into database and  <br>00:09:08.920 just copy these into the  <br>00:09:12.200 columns and this one we will edit the  <br>00:09:15.480 property and turn it into a URL and we  <br>00:09:18.680 will delete this so it's a bit flawed  <br>00:09:20.800 but you get the idea another great tip  <br>00:09:22.839 with AI here is create yourself a  <br>00:09:25.120 database template edit the template and  <br>00:09:28.320 create yourself in here a custom AI  <br>00:09:31.160 block and then that will generate what  <br>00:09:33.160 you need into the page let us know what  <br>00:09:35.560 your favorite notion shortcuts are in  <br>00:09:37.480 the comments so we can all learn from  <br>00:09:38.800 each other and while you're there give  <br>00:09:40.360 me a thumbs up so that's got you saving  <br>00:09:42.519 some time in notion but it doesn't mean  <br>00:09:44.920 much unless the work you get done is  <br>00:09:46.800 actually meaningful so next we'll look  <br>00:09:48.760 at some notion AI features that can  <br>00:09:50.800 improve the quality of your work before  <br>00:09:52.920 that though I want to show you another  <br>00:09:54.360 app I've used for years alongside notion  <br>00:09:56.680 to improve my learning and knowledge  <br>00:09:58.519 short form and it's got its own AI  <br>00:10:00.680 features that have supercharged it even  <br>00:10:02.720 further now if you don't know by now  <br>00:10:04.560 short form is my favorite solution for  <br>00:10:06.800 recapping and discovering the key ideas  <br>00:10:09.440 in non-fiction books in advance of  <br>00:10:11.760 reading them of course and they cover a  <br>00:10:13.880 range of subjects like productivity  <br>00:10:16.320 creativity and Entrepreneurship it's  <br>00:10:18.480 more than a summary tool though and  <br>00:10:19.959 that's what's particularly cool it  <br>00:10:21.839 offers additional insights interactive  <br>00:10:24.120 exercises offering further perspectives  <br>00:10:26.279 on what you read I've recently finished  <br>00:10:28.000 reading the procrastination Cure by  <br>00:10:30.440 Daman zaharis a super useful book on  <br>00:10:33.399 understanding why we procrastinate and  <br>00:10:35.160 waste time another way to make sure you  <br>00:10:36.800 can get more done with less alongside  <br>00:10:38.440 these tricks but short form has an AI  <br>00:10:40.760 Chrome browser extension of its own and  <br>00:10:43.279 it's particularly accurate compared to  <br>00:10:45.120 others that I've tried now I'm finding  <br>00:10:47.079 it genuinely useful as a research tool  <br>00:10:49.320 to improve the quality of the content  <br>00:10:51.399 that I create it has fundamental  <br>00:10:53.040 features many AI extensions like they  <br>00:10:55.160 should generating high quality summaries  <br>00:10:57.120 for anything on the internet from emails  <br>00:10:59.320 to videos listing the key ideas and  <br>00:11:01.680 simplifying long and complicated topics  <br>00:11:04.200 but what I really like about the short  <br>00:11:06.079 form AI is the fact that it also offers  <br>00:11:08.519 additional sources that are linked to  <br>00:11:10.560 give an opportunity to learn further and  <br>00:11:12.880 gain well-rounded understandings on the  <br>00:11:14.959 subjects access to the AI extension is  <br>00:11:17.120 free but with limited accessibility and  <br>00:11:19.120 full capabilities are available with the  <br>00:11:21.120 premium subscription to short form new  <br>00:11:22.920 and existing paid premium users gain  <br>00:11:25.000 full access to the extension and short  <br>00:11:27.279 forms high quality nonf book guides so  <br>00:11:31.240 give it a try you can actually get a 20%  <br>00:11:33.760 discount to a short form premium  <br>00:11:35.320 subscription which includes that  <br>00:11:37.079 unlimited access to the AI via my link  <br>00:11:39.519 short [form.com](http://form.com/)  <br>00:11:40.880 creating so thank you very much to  <br>00:11:42.880 shortform for sponsoring this part of  <br>00:11:44.519 the video right back to notion and these  <br>00:11:47.000 next sections are about improving the  <br>00:11:49.600 quality of your work better  <br>00:11:51.519 collaboration this is another way that  <br>00:11:53.639 I've been using notion wrong not  <br>00:11:55.639 embracing the collaboration tools even  <br>00:11:58.600 in a personal workspace first remember  <br>00:12:01.519 that you can invite guests by clicking  <br>00:12:04.920 share up here and you can do it for free  <br>00:12:07.839 so when you jump up here you can find  <br>00:12:10.800 someone's email so let's say I wanted to  <br>00:12:12.680 invite Tom here if I click add and  <br>00:12:15.880 invite Tom it will also ask you if you  <br>00:12:18.040 want to add him to your workspace don't  <br>00:12:20.279 do that because you will end up paying  <br>00:12:22.079 for them as a member always skip that  <br>00:12:24.519 but you can still give them full access  <br>00:12:26.600 to the page which is rather good the joy  <br>00:12:29.360 that is that you can share pages and  <br>00:12:32.120 then anything within those pages those  <br>00:12:34.240 people can see as well so for example if  <br>00:12:36.720 you were using say my life OS and you  <br>00:12:39.199 shared the life OS with a person they  <br>00:12:42.800 would be able to access all of the  <br>00:12:44.680 databases within that template and you  <br>00:12:47.120 could start using it as a shared  <br>00:12:49.000 workspace for free in notion as long as  <br>00:12:51.880 you don't add them as a member recently  <br>00:12:53.560 I've been doing a complete audit of my  <br>00:12:55.800 company my work my channel and so on and  <br>00:12:58.040 so forth with an in company called the  <br>00:13:00.079 generalist Co we're doing a huge amount  <br>00:13:02.199 of work but what's really cool is that  <br>00:13:04.440 we're actually doing some commentary on  <br>00:13:06.839 things I really think you should start  <br>00:13:08.480 embracing the use of comments with  <br>00:13:10.160 people the best way to do this is to for  <br>00:13:12.519 example highlight a subject and then  <br>00:13:15.000 just click comment by using a at mention  <br>00:13:18.240 I can find my colleague Debs and I can  <br>00:13:20.680 say just showing the audience how to use  <br>00:13:24.199 comments in notion and send it and then  <br>00:13:27.839 people can reply underneath and once  <br>00:13:30.639 it's completed you can resolve it and it  <br>00:13:34.040 will disappear I've always avoided it  <br>00:13:35.760 but it's actually an excellent way to  <br>00:13:37.560 work with a guest collaborator did you  <br>00:13:39.320 know that you can use AI to generate  <br>00:13:42.440 visual data here's a little example I've  <br>00:13:44.839 created this prompt create a pie chart  <br>00:13:47.760 using mermaid which is a chart creation  <br>00:13:50.519 system you have to name the type of  <br>00:13:52.199 chart you want so I'm going to copy that  <br>00:13:54.000 paste it into Ai and press enter and  <br>00:13:56.320 watch this it will create the pie chart  <br>00:14:01.000 using Mermaid so if you can find a way  <br>00:14:03.120 to insert data and update that yourself  <br>00:14:06.519 this is a great quick way into learning  <br>00:14:08.600 to use mermaid and have data  <br>00:14:10.399 visualization in your workspace give it  <br>00:14:12.680 a go and finally chatting with your  <br>00:14:14.800 notion workspace now a lot of people  <br>00:14:17.440 down here might see this little button  <br>00:14:19.320 or you might see a sign up to the  <br>00:14:21.320 waiting list I recommend doing it  <br>00:14:23.240 because you can try this on a free  <br>00:14:24.639 account so this is the AI system so look  <br>00:14:28.079 it says hi Simon ask me about anything  <br>00:14:30.079 in better creating I'll find the answer  <br>00:14:32.639 and be able to help you do things I've  <br>00:14:34.600 only just realized the power of this  <br>00:14:36.560 it's like having a personal researcher  <br>00:14:39.079 within your workspace that can help you  <br>00:14:41.240 find things and do a lot of stuff what  <br>00:14:43.720 makes this special and different to  <br>00:14:45.279 something like chat GPT is that Q&A  <br>00:14:48.600 bases all its answers on the information  <br>00:14:51.120 in your workspace rather than the wider  <br>00:14:53.360 web this is a super powerful use case  <br>00:14:56.079 for it because it will only look for  <br>00:14:58.199 things you've got and not go wider so  <br>00:15:00.720 number one you could search your  <br>00:15:02.320 knowledge base or project back catalog  <br>00:15:04.560 so what should we say about what do I  <br>00:15:07.519 know about the par method first of all  <br>00:15:13.440 what it's doing is finding the  <br>00:15:15.480 references and then it will actually  <br>00:15:18.000 give me some direct answers now if you  <br>00:15:20.399 don't know about par it's a system to  <br>00:15:22.560 manage your projects areas resources and  <br>00:15:25.360 archives within something like a second  <br>00:15:27.440 brain now you can see that it's found a  <br>00:15:30.360 number of different sources here and you  <br>00:15:32.160 can see it is showing me also the link  <br>00:15:36.319 to the file so I can jump to it and go  <br>00:15:39.639 back to that same file where all the  <br>00:15:41.360 information was this is super powerful  <br>00:15:43.880 this combination of citation and  <br>00:15:46.279 answering but what we could also say is  <br>00:15:48.720 what videos have I created on the  <br>00:15:52.680 subject check the content database now  <br>00:15:55.279 it's not as accurate as finding  <br>00:15:57.440 something within a database yet and it  <br>00:15:59.199 also can't recognize if you say current  <br>00:16:01.360 page whilst in beta but it has done a  <br>00:16:04.040 little bit of work here look my notion  <br>00:16:06.040 life OS second brain uh and a beginner's  <br>00:16:08.880 guide and it will show me some of those  <br>00:16:10.519 things not bad now what's really nice  <br>00:16:12.600 about this window is that it will stay  <br>00:16:14.560 with you as you navigate so if I go to  <br>00:16:17.959 other pages I can continue to look at  <br>00:16:20.360 this meaning that it kind of has a  <br>00:16:21.880 memory and I can work with it as I move  <br>00:16:24.839 through my system which I think is  <br>00:16:26.839 really powerful but the great thing  <br>00:16:28.279 about this is it also works within a  <br>00:16:30.360 page using ask AI so if we look at my  <br>00:16:32.800 script and find save to notion in here  <br>00:16:34.880 we were talking about earlier I can ask  <br>00:16:37.040 AI what do I know about this and I can  <br>00:16:41.560 say look you can see where I've  <br>00:16:43.600 mentioned it in a document in fact it's  <br>00:16:46.680 in this one and I can also see that I've  <br>00:16:49.399 talked about it in various different  <br>00:16:50.800 places if I jump to my knowledge and  <br>00:16:52.639 clippings I can see my books here if we  <br>00:16:55.199 jump into say the 4-Hour Work week we  <br>00:16:58.040 can find some very ious quotes that I've  <br>00:17:00.120 taken from readwise and my Kindle to  <br>00:17:02.800 drop it in there now let's say that I  <br>00:17:04.520 wanted to take a look at an idea within  <br>00:17:06.679 this something like money I can ask AI  <br>00:17:10.119 what materials do I have on this subject  <br>00:17:11.839 for a lot of the time this is really  <br>00:17:13.760 super powerful you've got to be precise  <br>00:17:15.480 about how you use it and to be honest  <br>00:17:16.959 whilst this is a great answer it's got  <br>00:17:18.679 stuck on the current page so I'm  <br>00:17:20.119 actually going to give it a thumbs  <br>00:17:22.319 down there you go and I fed back to  <br>00:17:24.559 notion the next example for using Q&A in  <br>00:17:27.079 this is about creating proposals for  <br>00:17:29.400 projects or outlines based on your wider  <br>00:17:31.960 knowledge based so I can ask the Q&A  <br>00:17:34.360 system to draw on my existing content to  <br>00:17:36.919 create an informed outline for  <br>00:17:39.559 example I'm going to try this you're an  <br>00:17:41.960 expert in online education and social  <br>00:17:43.600 media create proposal based on my recent  <br>00:17:45.480 video scripts and YouTube projects to  <br>00:17:48.039 propose an outline for a video course  <br>00:17:51.720 called part-time productivity 101 let's  <br>00:17:54.280 try  <br>00:17:56.880 it so what's really interesting about  <br>00:17:59.520 this is this has referenced a number of  <br>00:18:01.880 things now I think this is a brilliant  <br>00:18:03.679 example of how far you can take this  <br>00:18:06.960 it's given me a introduction brain dump  <br>00:18:10.039 time management habits and getting  <br>00:18:11.600 things done minimalist productivity blah  <br>00:18:14.039 blah blah and it's referencing a number  <br>00:18:16.799 of things that I've created so I've got  <br>00:18:18.480 my skillshare course that I'm planning  <br>00:18:20.440 it's also looked at a video where I  <br>00:18:22.480 talked about this it's also found future  <br>00:18:26.480 projects that I was planning how to stop  <br>00:18:28.480 proc procastinating an old video and  <br>00:18:30.520 it's got a complete notion productivity  <br>00:18:32.679 in 60 seconds so it's referencing all of  <br>00:18:34.960 those kind of Key Systems that I've used  <br>00:18:37.159 and bits of writing and turned it into  <br>00:18:39.360 that I'm going to be using that to  <br>00:18:41.039 create myself a skillshare course and  <br>00:18:43.720 work into it so if you already have paid  <br>00:18:45.760 for the notion AI add-on you should have  <br>00:18:48.000 access to Q&A already if not just  <br>00:18:50.720 refresh your workspace but also do check  <br>00:18:53.159 if you have the option as a free user  <br>00:18:55.080 you probably do and you can use it for a  <br>00:18:57.120 limited number of entries finally be  <br>00:18:59.600 aware of the limitations of the current  <br>00:19:01.880 Q&A system in the beta version it can  <br>00:19:04.840 occasionally not find information so  <br>00:19:06.919 just give it a thumbs down and feedback  <br>00:19:09.000 if it's not right and that will help  <br>00:19:10.840 them improve it it's not great also at  <br>00:19:13.240 finding complete collections of pages if  <br>00:19:15.320 you ask to find everything on a subject  <br>00:19:17.120 it doesn't always do the full list and  <br>00:19:18.720 at the moment it can't search just  <br>00:19:20.159 within the current page it doesn't know  <br>00:19:22.000 what that means finally new data that  <br>00:19:24.000 you've added to your system might take  <br>00:19:25.720 around 30 minutes to be indexed before  <br>00:19:28.159 the system can reference it so so far we  <br>00:19:31.440 found a bunch of use cases that make  <br>00:19:33.320 notion AI worthwhile to save you time  <br>00:19:35.840 and improve what you do but there are a  <br>00:19:37.840 ton of ways that you can turn notion  <br>00:19:39.679 into the perfect personalized

[https://www.youtube.com/watch/FxisKkkY5no](https://www.youtube.com/watch/FxisKkkY5no)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.080 hi it's Simon and it turns out I've been  <br>00:00:01.959 using notion wrong for months why well  <br>00:00:04.880 I've been stuck in the past failing to  <br>00:00:06.759 see how easily notion Ai and some other  <br>00:00:09.240 quick shortcut features can massively  <br>00:00:11.480 Save Us hours and optimize our workflow  <br>00:00:14.480 now like me you might have been dubious  <br>00:00:16.520 as to how usable AI actually was in  <br>00:00:18.920 notion after hours of experimenting  <br>00:00:21.279 these are the best ways to use it that  <br>00:00:23.519 actually work saving you time and  <br>00:00:25.720 improving the quality of your work in  <br>00:00:28.000 notion  <br>00:00:30.960 so let's start to harness those hidden  <br>00:00:32.880 powers of notion to make your notion  <br>00:00:35.079 workspace life OS template wink or  <br>00:00:38.480 notion second brain both easier to use  <br>00:00:41.360 and more powerful I mean these days it  <br>00:00:43.559 can even talk to you stick around for  <br>00:00:45.640 that and thank you to short form my  <br>00:00:47.840 other secret productivity tool for  <br>00:00:50.079 sponsoring this video this first one is  <br>00:00:53.039 a very exciting Discovery for me the new  <br>00:00:55.640 AI database properties are great and can  <br>00:00:58.199 help you a huge amount but often feel a  <br>00:01:00.440 bit generic and meaningless when used as  <br>00:01:03.039 a simple summary unless you Embrace how  <br>00:01:05.640 to customize them let me show you then  <br>00:01:07.720 some amazing examples that have been big  <br>00:01:09.880 news for me with how I've been using  <br>00:01:12.400 notion AI to manage my YouTube video  <br>00:01:14.920 creation from scripting through to  <br>00:01:16.680 managing projects with collaborators so  <br>00:01:19.000 if we click to my content manager you'll  <br>00:01:21.360 see all of my current videos including  <br>00:01:23.280 the one we're working on and this is  <br>00:01:24.720 where I run my channel now at the moment  <br>00:01:26.720 I'm working on creating a help Bop for  <br>00:01:29.479 my life OS template users to assist them  <br>00:01:32.200 something that can direct people to the  <br>00:01:33.960 relevant notion videos in my library  <br>00:01:36.439 which is here that link to specific  <br>00:01:38.399 templates I mentioned for example right  <br>00:01:40.560 down here I have all of my published  <br>00:01:43.119 videos with the links notion AI has  <br>00:01:45.680 helped this massively in the content  <br>00:01:47.799 manager so if we click on my simplified  <br>00:01:50.159 notion life OS tour you'll see that I  <br>00:01:52.159 have here a AI content summary tool this  <br>00:01:56.360 was generated by AI it is summarizing  <br>00:01:59.280 the title of the video it's putting the  <br>00:02:00.880 URL an intro to what happens talking  <br>00:02:03.399 about what I cover and saying why people  <br>00:02:05.600 should watch if I click in here and we  <br>00:02:07.880 edit the property we have an AI autofill  <br>00:02:11.200 and within this I can list a custom  <br>00:02:13.720 autofill so please do the following  <br>00:02:16.000 write the video title and URL then  <br>00:02:18.000 summarize the content of the following  <br>00:02:19.720 sections and then finally a subheading  <br>00:02:21.840 of why to watch and share some  <br>00:02:23.440 information on why people might enjoy  <br>00:02:25.080 watching it so what that's actually  <br>00:02:26.480 doing is down here we have in scripting  <br>00:02:29.680 we have the hook and setup here that I  <br>00:02:32.120 wrote as a script and we have a list of  <br>00:02:34.480 everything that I cover in the video  <br>00:02:36.440 planned out when I did my tour of this  <br>00:02:38.959 simplified life OS that I made and it  <br>00:02:41.200 summarized all of those details I've  <br>00:02:43.480 also created a property which is a  <br>00:02:45.879 custom auto and I've listed in here what  <br>00:02:48.959 to generate you're an expert in SEO  <br>00:02:50.959 create a YouTube description for the  <br>00:02:53.640 video and it can actually generate  <br>00:02:55.720 things as well let's give it a go you'll  <br>00:02:57.360 see it is writing out the video title  <br>00:03:00.519 it's suggested some sections and it's  <br>00:03:02.680 given me some keywords that is a huge  <br>00:03:04.560 amount of work for me normally which I  <br>00:03:06.239 can now work from in that video and I'm  <br>00:03:09.040 ready to rock so if you wanted to do  <br>00:03:11.040 this you would simply create whatever  <br>00:03:13.280 database that you want you would select  <br>00:03:15.480 a new property and you have these  <br>00:03:17.280 options up here for AI keywords  <br>00:03:19.440 translation custom autofill and AI  <br>00:03:21.560 summary I think this one is really  <br>00:03:23.440 powerful so if in my content manager I  <br>00:03:25.519 wanted to add a new one let's say I  <br>00:03:27.120 wanted keywords for each I could select  <br>00:03:29.159 the AI keywords option can see more  <br>00:03:31.680 details about it what to  <br>00:03:33.599 generate let's try  <br>00:03:35.640 it and you can see in here we now have  <br>00:03:38.680 if I wrap the column a list of keywords  <br>00:03:41.879 so this could be great in a larger  <br>00:03:43.560 system maybe you'd want to use it in a  <br>00:03:45.120 journal and you could add in keywords  <br>00:03:47.519 into the system and do it all  <br>00:03:49.040 automatically but even more remarkable  <br>00:03:50.959 for a while I found that notion AI could  <br>00:03:53.280 actually go further than this so if I  <br>00:03:55.040 open up this iPad accessories video  <br>00:03:57.200 there's my content summary as we've set  <br>00:03:59.519 but below it I've got this a final video  <br>00:04:02.480 description and it seemed strangely that  <br>00:04:05.159 it would reach outside the system it has  <br>00:04:07.400 since weirdly stopped working so this is  <br>00:04:09.480 an unconfirmed bit of info and in fact  <br>00:04:11.920 occasionally notion AI has raised an  <br>00:04:13.560 error saying it couldn't look at  <br>00:04:15.200 external URLs but take a look at this  <br>00:04:17.358 example what I've done with this if we  <br>00:04:19.399 look at the property final video  <br>00:04:21.079 description it says using the URL  <br>00:04:23.479 property link please find the video  <br>00:04:25.280 description for that link on YouTube and  <br>00:04:27.600 share the text from that video descript  <br>00:04:29.680 description in this property and it's  <br>00:04:31.600 genuinely done that this is the  <br>00:04:33.720 description for my video listing  <br>00:04:36.440 everything into it including all of my  <br>00:04:38.360 links to the products if I now jump to  <br>00:04:40.759 the YouTube page there it all is there  <br>00:04:43.720 is all the information that we listed in  <br>00:04:46.639 it so leave me a comment below if you  <br>00:04:48.440 found any other unexpected use cases and  <br>00:04:51.240 do give this a go and let me know if it  <br>00:04:52.880 works for you I've also used the key  <br>00:04:54.960 info option to list key topics on my  <br>00:04:57.280 clippings and notes pages and love the  <br>00:04:59.800 summary feature for journaling templates  <br>00:05:02.479 to Summarize each entry in a gallery  <br>00:05:04.960 view so I've been using this in my  <br>00:05:07.039 notion Essentials template so I've got  <br>00:05:09.160 all these different templates you can  <br>00:05:10.720 put the template in fill it out and then  <br>00:05:13.160 you will see the summary of what you've  <br>00:05:14.560 written in here but for example maybe  <br>00:05:16.680 you wanted to create a AI categories  <br>00:05:18.639 thing we could add a property here new  <br>00:05:20.840 property and we'll do AI keywords multi  <br>00:05:25.680 select and let's call this AI category  <br>00:05:30.680 something like that save the changes try  <br>00:05:34.080 on this page and if we now show it in  <br>00:05:36.639 here there you go it's coming up and you  <br>00:05:38.800 can add really quickly AI keyword  <br>00:05:41.680 summaries into the system you can check  <br>00:05:43.840 out my notion Essentials templates via  <br>00:05:45.960 the link below if you want to try any of  <br>00:05:47.840 these out now use case number two for  <br>00:05:49.639 you life OS and second brain users is  <br>00:05:51.880 that these summary properties get even  <br>00:05:53.840 cooler if we use AI from notion  <br>00:05:57.759 alongside save to notion to summarize  <br>00:06:00.400 clipping so if we jump to a web page you  <br>00:06:04.000 can download the Chrome extension for  <br>00:06:05.600 save to notion and you can create these  <br>00:06:07.360 forms right which are rather good and  <br>00:06:09.400 it'll link things in and include stuff  <br>00:06:11.440 in so what I want to do is I'm going to  <br>00:06:13.000 add a new property to that database add  <br>00:06:15.800 a new property and we'll make that a  <br>00:06:18.680 simple AI  <br>00:06:20.840 summary how about this summarize in  <br>00:06:23.800 bullet points the key information and  <br>00:06:25.720 lessons from the page material and  <br>00:06:27.840 reference any other possible page pages  <br>00:06:29.840 in my workspace that could be relevant  <br>00:06:31.520 to it so I'm going to save that there  <br>00:06:34.120 and what we'll do is we'll jump to here  <br>00:06:37.639 back to our page and our save to notion  <br>00:06:40.199 option I'm going to add a new field in  <br>00:06:42.240 here and I'm going to find the AI  <br>00:06:44.759 summary option there it is and we want  <br>00:06:47.280 to put all of the  <br>00:06:48.800 content web page content is going to go  <br>00:06:51.120 in and I'm going to save it so it's web  <br>00:06:53.120 page content it's all ready to go and  <br>00:06:55.479 maybe I will give this a status of on  <br>00:06:58.160 reading list so I can up up date it all  <br>00:07:00.039 in there then you save it to your  <br>00:07:02.879 workspace and now if we jump back there  <br>00:07:05.000 it is so there's all the information if  <br>00:07:06.800 we then get that to do its thing it  <br>00:07:09.240 summarizes everything within that page  <br>00:07:11.759 this is a brilliant use of AI to clean  <br>00:07:14.680 up the way you look at your information  <br>00:07:17.120 so notion AI is $10 for the add-on but  <br>00:07:20.680 if you see the value that is an amazing  <br>00:07:22.879 deal okay so that's cool but we can go  <br>00:07:25.800 further and actually talk to your  <br>00:07:27.879 workspaces to explore all the knowledge  <br>00:07:30.479 within them more on that later in the  <br>00:07:32.560 video but first let's look at a few of  <br>00:07:35.120 the latest quick and simple tricks that  <br>00:07:37.240 I've found that can also speed up how  <br>00:07:40.080 you use notion not just AI so my  <br>00:07:43.240 favorite new feature has got to be this  <br>00:07:45.599 if I go into my sidebar and I want to  <br>00:07:48.319 open something in a new tab press  <br>00:07:50.080 command and then click it and it opens  <br>00:07:53.039 it in a new tab that is super brilliant  <br>00:07:56.479 and on that note if I want to reference  <br>00:07:58.280 a page ever or get the link for it  <br>00:08:00.319 command L will copy it to your clipboard  <br>00:08:03.440 so that means if I go back into here  <br>00:08:05.479 command V mention the page you can very  <br>00:08:07.879 quickly create yourself a little menu  <br>00:08:10.159 using at mentions or this is just a  <br>00:08:12.440 great way to share pages with people  <br>00:08:14.319 that you're working with and finally on  <br>00:08:15.919 this list is number three AI tables and  <br>00:08:18.639 databases this one up here was created  <br>00:08:21.759 by creating a simple table and then  <br>00:08:24.639 turning it into a database so to  <br>00:08:27.199 shortcut that first part of the building  <br>00:08:29.560 process when you want to get a new  <br>00:08:31.319 bespoke nation database created this is  <br>00:08:33.880 a fantastic trick the quickest way to  <br>00:08:35.760 get into AI is just to press space and I  <br>00:08:38.320 can write what I want so I might say  <br>00:08:40.360 create a table of the top classic  <br>00:08:45.360 motorcycles from the UK and  <br>00:08:49.200 Europe let's see what that does there it  <br>00:08:52.080 goes year release best features  <br>00:08:53.519 reference URL it's creating the table  <br>00:08:56.080 and filling it out of course you would  <br>00:08:58.000 want to probably do a little bit more  <br>00:09:00.079 work on this yourself but look how fast  <br>00:09:02.440 it's creating this let's say it's done  <br>00:09:05.000 I'm then going to click on the side  <br>00:09:06.240 panel here click turn into database and  <br>00:09:08.920 just copy these into the  <br>00:09:12.200 columns and this one we will edit the  <br>00:09:15.480 property and turn it into a URL and we  <br>00:09:18.680 will delete this so it's a bit flawed  <br>00:09:20.800 but you get the idea another great tip  <br>00:09:22.839 with AI here is create yourself a  <br>00:09:25.120 database template edit the template and  <br>00:09:28.320 create yourself in here a custom AI  <br>00:09:31.160 block and then that will generate what  <br>00:09:33.160 you need into the page let us know what  <br>00:09:35.560 your favorite notion shortcuts are in  <br>00:09:37.480 the comments so we can all learn from  <br>00:09:38.800 each other and while you're there give  <br>00:09:40.360 me a thumbs up so that's got you saving  <br>00:09:42.519 some time in notion but it doesn't mean  <br>00:09:44.920 much unless the work you get done is  <br>00:09:46.800 actually meaningful so next we'll look  <br>00:09:48.760 at some notion AI features that can  <br>00:09:50.800 improve the quality of your work before  <br>00:09:52.920 that though I want to show you another  <br>00:09:54.360 app I've used for years alongside notion  <br>00:09:56.680 to improve my learning and knowledge  <br>00:09:58.519 short form and it's got its own AI  <br>00:10:00.680 features that have supercharged it even  <br>00:10:02.720 further now if you don't know by now  <br>00:10:04.560 short form is my favorite solution for  <br>00:10:06.800 recapping and discovering the key ideas  <br>00:10:09.440 in non-fiction books in advance of  <br>00:10:11.760 reading them of course and they cover a  <br>00:10:13.880 range of subjects like productivity  <br>00:10:16.320 creativity and Entrepreneurship it's  <br>00:10:18.480 more than a summary tool though and  <br>00:10:19.959 that's what's particularly cool it  <br>00:10:21.839 offers additional insights interactive  <br>00:10:24.120 exercises offering further perspectives  <br>00:10:26.279 on what you read I've recently finished  <br>00:10:28.000 reading the procrastination Cure by  <br>00:10:30.440 Daman zaharis a super useful book on  <br>00:10:33.399 understanding why we procrastinate and  <br>00:10:35.160 waste time another way to make sure you  <br>00:10:36.800 can get more done with less alongside  <br>00:10:38.440 these tricks but short form has an AI  <br>00:10:40.760 Chrome browser extension of its own and  <br>00:10:43.279 it's particularly accurate compared to  <br>00:10:45.120 others that I've tried now I'm finding  <br>00:10:47.079 it genuinely useful as a research tool  <br>00:10:49.320 to improve the quality of the content  <br>00:10:51.399 that I create it has fundamental  <br>00:10:53.040 features many AI extensions like they  <br>00:10:55.160 should generating high quality summaries  <br>00:10:57.120 for anything on the internet from emails  <br>00:10:59.320 to videos listing the key ideas and  <br>00:11:01.680 simplifying long and complicated topics  <br>00:11:04.200 but what I really like about the short  <br>00:11:06.079 form AI is the fact that it also offers  <br>00:11:08.519 additional sources that are linked to  <br>00:11:10.560 give an opportunity to learn further and  <br>00:11:12.880 gain well-rounded understandings on the  <br>00:11:14.959 subjects access to the AI extension is  <br>00:11:17.120 free but with limited accessibility and  <br>00:11:19.120 full capabilities are available with the  <br>00:11:21.120 premium subscription to short form new  <br>00:11:22.920 and existing paid premium users gain  <br>00:11:25.000 full access to the extension and short  <br>00:11:27.279 forms high quality nonf book guides so  <br>00:11:31.240 give it a try you can actually get a 20%  <br>00:11:33.760 discount to a short form premium  <br>00:11:35.320 subscription which includes that  <br>00:11:37.079 unlimited access to the AI via my link  <br>00:11:39.519 short [form.com](http://form.com/)  <br>00:11:40.880 creating so thank you very much to  <br>00:11:42.880 shortform for sponsoring this part of  <br>00:11:44.519 the video right back to notion and these  <br>00:11:47.000 next sections are about improving the  <br>00:11:49.600 quality of your work better  <br>00:11:51.519 collaboration this is another way that  <br>00:11:53.639 I've been using notion wrong not  <br>00:11:55.639 embracing the collaboration tools even  <br>00:11:58.600 in a personal workspace first remember  <br>00:12:01.519 that you can invite guests by clicking  <br>00:12:04.920 share up here and you can do it for free  <br>00:12:07.839 so when you jump up here you can find  <br>00:12:10.800 someone's email so let's say I wanted to  <br>00:12:12.680 invite Tom here if I click add and  <br>00:12:15.880 invite Tom it will also ask you if you  <br>00:12:18.040 want to add him to your workspace don't  <br>00:12:20.279 do that because you will end up paying  <br>00:12:22.079 for them as a member always skip that  <br>00:12:24.519 but you can still give them full access  <br>00:12:26.600 to the page which is rather good the joy  <br>00:12:29.360 that is that you can share pages and  <br>00:12:32.120 then anything within those pages those  <br>00:12:34.240 people can see as well so for example if  <br>00:12:36.720 you were using say my life OS and you  <br>00:12:39.199 shared the life OS with a person they  <br>00:12:42.800 would be able to access all of the  <br>00:12:44.680 databases within that template and you  <br>00:12:47.120 could start using it as a shared  <br>00:12:49.000 workspace for free in notion as long as  <br>00:12:51.880 you don't add them as a member recently  <br>00:12:53.560 I've been doing a complete audit of my  <br>00:12:55.800 company my work my channel and so on and  <br>00:12:58.040 so forth with an in company called the  <br>00:13:00.079 generalist Co we're doing a huge amount  <br>00:13:02.199 of work but what's really cool is that  <br>00:13:04.440 we're actually doing some commentary on  <br>00:13:06.839 things I really think you should start  <br>00:13:08.480 embracing the use of comments with  <br>00:13:10.160 people the best way to do this is to for  <br>00:13:12.519 example highlight a subject and then  <br>00:13:15.000 just click comment by using a at mention  <br>00:13:18.240 I can find my colleague Debs and I can  <br>00:13:20.680 say just showing the audience how to use  <br>00:13:24.199 comments in notion and send it and then  <br>00:13:27.839 people can reply underneath and once  <br>00:13:30.639 it's completed you can resolve it and it  <br>00:13:34.040 will disappear I've always avoided it  <br>00:13:35.760 but it's actually an excellent way to  <br>00:13:37.560 work with a guest collaborator did you  <br>00:13:39.320 know that you can use AI to generate  <br>00:13:42.440 visual data here's a little example I've  <br>00:13:44.839 created this prompt create a pie chart  <br>00:13:47.760 using mermaid which is a chart creation  <br>00:13:50.519 system you have to name the type of  <br>00:13:52.199 chart you want so I'm going to copy that  <br>00:13:54.000 paste it into Ai and press enter and  <br>00:13:56.320 watch this it will create the pie chart  <br>00:14:01.000 using Mermaid so if you can find a way  <br>00:14:03.120 to insert data and update that yourself  <br>00:14:06.519 this is a great quick way into learning  <br>00:14:08.600 to use mermaid and have data  <br>00:14:10.399 visualization in your workspace give it  <br>00:14:12.680 a go and finally chatting with your  <br>00:14:14.800 notion workspace now a lot of people  <br>00:14:17.440 down here might see this little button  <br>00:14:19.320 or you might see a sign up to the  <br>00:14:21.320 waiting list I recommend doing it  <br>00:14:23.240 because you can try this on a free  <br>00:14:24.639 account so this is the AI system so look  <br>00:14:28.079 it says hi Simon ask me about anything  <br>00:14:30.079 in better creating I'll find the answer  <br>00:14:32.639 and be able to help you do things I've  <br>00:14:34.600 only just realized the power of this  <br>00:14:36.560 it's like having a personal researcher  <br>00:14:39.079 within your workspace that can help you  <br>00:14:41.240 find things and do a lot of stuff what  <br>00:14:43.720 makes this special and different to  <br>00:14:45.279 something like chat GPT is that Q&A  <br>00:14:48.600 bases all its answers on the information  <br>00:14:51.120 in your workspace rather than the wider  <br>00:14:53.360 web this is a super powerful use case  <br>00:14:56.079 for it because it will only look for  <br>00:14:58.199 things you've got and not go wider so  <br>00:15:00.720 number one you could search your  <br>00:15:02.320 knowledge base or project back catalog  <br>00:15:04.560 so what should we say about what do I  <br>00:15:07.519 know about the par method first of all  <br>00:15:13.440 what it's doing is finding the  <br>00:15:15.480 references and then it will actually  <br>00:15:18.000 give me some direct answers now if you  <br>00:15:20.399 don't know about par it's a system to  <br>00:15:22.560 manage your projects areas resources and  <br>00:15:25.360 archives within something like a second  <br>00:15:27.440 brain now you can see that it's found a  <br>00:15:30.360 number of different sources here and you  <br>00:15:32.160 can see it is showing me also the link  <br>00:15:36.319 to the file so I can jump to it and go  <br>00:15:39.639 back to that same file where all the  <br>00:15:41.360 information was this is super powerful  <br>00:15:43.880 this combination of citation and  <br>00:15:46.279 answering but what we could also say is  <br>00:15:48.720 what videos have I created on the  <br>00:15:52.680 subject check the content database now  <br>00:15:55.279 it's not as accurate as finding  <br>00:15:57.440 something within a database yet and it  <br>00:15:59.199 also can't recognize if you say current  <br>00:16:01.360 page whilst in beta but it has done a  <br>00:16:04.040 little bit of work here look my notion  <br>00:16:06.040 life OS second brain uh and a beginner's  <br>00:16:08.880 guide and it will show me some of those  <br>00:16:10.519 things not bad now what's really nice  <br>00:16:12.600 about this window is that it will stay  <br>00:16:14.560 with you as you navigate so if I go to  <br>00:16:17.959 other pages I can continue to look at  <br>00:16:20.360 this meaning that it kind of has a  <br>00:16:21.880 memory and I can work with it as I move  <br>00:16:24.839 through my system which I think is  <br>00:16:26.839 really powerful but the great thing  <br>00:16:28.279 about this is it also works within a  <br>00:16:30.360 page using ask AI so if we look at my  <br>00:16:32.800 script and find save to notion in here  <br>00:16:34.880 we were talking about earlier I can ask  <br>00:16:37.040 AI what do I know about this and I can  <br>00:16:41.560 say look you can see where I've  <br>00:16:43.600 mentioned it in a document in fact it's  <br>00:16:46.680 in this one and I can also see that I've  <br>00:16:49.399 talked about it in various different  <br>00:16:50.800 places if I jump to my knowledge and  <br>00:16:52.639 clippings I can see my books here if we  <br>00:16:55.199 jump into say the 4-Hour Work week we  <br>00:16:58.040 can find some very ious quotes that I've  <br>00:17:00.120 taken from readwise and my Kindle to  <br>00:17:02.800 drop it in there now let's say that I  <br>00:17:04.520 wanted to take a look at an idea within  <br>00:17:06.679 this something like money I can ask AI  <br>00:17:10.119 what materials do I have on this subject  <br>00:17:11.839 for a lot of the time this is really  <br>00:17:13.760 super powerful you've got to be precise  <br>00:17:15.480 about how you use it and to be honest  <br>00:17:16.959 whilst this is a great answer it's got  <br>00:17:18.679 stuck on the current page so I'm  <br>00:17:20.119 actually going to give it a thumbs  <br>00:17:22.319 down there you go and I fed back to  <br>00:17:24.559 notion the next example for using Q&A in  <br>00:17:27.079 this is about creating proposals for  <br>00:17:29.400 projects or outlines based on your wider  <br>00:17:31.960 knowledge based so I can ask the Q&A  <br>00:17:34.360 system to draw on my existing content to  <br>00:17:36.919 create an informed outline for  <br>00:17:39.559 example I'm going to try this you're an  <br>00:17:41.960 expert in online education and social  <br>00:17:43.600 media create proposal based on my recent  <br>00:17:45.480 video scripts and YouTube projects to  <br>00:17:48.039 propose an outline for a video course  <br>00:17:51.720 called part-time productivity 101 let's  <br>00:17:54.280 try  <br>00:17:56.880 it so what's really interesting about  <br>00:17:59.520 this is this has referenced a number of  <br>00:18:01.880 things now I think this is a brilliant  <br>00:18:03.679 example of how far you can take this  <br>00:18:06.960 it's given me a introduction brain dump  <br>00:18:10.039 time management habits and getting  <br>00:18:11.600 things done minimalist productivity blah  <br>00:18:14.039 blah blah and it's referencing a number  <br>00:18:16.799 of things that I've created so I've got  <br>00:18:18.480 my skillshare course that I'm planning  <br>00:18:20.440 it's also looked at a video where I  <br>00:18:22.480 talked about this it's also found future  <br>00:18:26.480 projects that I was planning how to stop  <br>00:18:28.480 proc procastinating an old video and  <br>00:18:30.520 it's got a complete notion productivity  <br>00:18:32.679 in 60 seconds so it's referencing all of  <br>00:18:34.960 those kind of Key Systems that I've used  <br>00:18:37.159 and bits of writing and turned it into  <br>00:18:39.360 that I'm going to be using that to  <br>00:18:41.039 create myself a skillshare course and  <br>00:18:43.720 work into it so if you already have paid  <br>00:18:45.760 for the notion AI add-on you should have  <br>00:18:48.000 access to Q&A already if not just  <br>00:18:50.720 refresh your workspace but also do check  <br>00:18:53.159 if you have the option as a free user  <br>00:18:55.080 you probably do and you can use it for a  <br>00:18:57.120 limited number of entries finally be  <br>00:18:59.600 aware of the limitations of the current  <br>00:19:01.880 Q&A system in the beta version it can  <br>00:19:04.840 occasionally not find information so  <br>00:19:06.919 just give it a thumbs down and feedback  <br>00:19:09.000 if it's not right and that will help  <br>00:19:10.840 them improve it it's not great also at  <br>00:19:13.240 finding complete collections of pages if  <br>00:19:15.320 you ask to find everything on a subject  <br>00:19:17.120 it doesn't always do the full list and  <br>00:19:18.720 at the moment it can't search just  <br>00:19:20.159 within the current page it doesn't know  <br>00:19:22.000 what that means finally new data that  <br>00:19:24.000 you've added to your system might take  <br>00:19:25.720 around 30 minutes to be indexed before  <br>00:19:28.159 the system can reference it so so far we  <br>00:19:31.440 found a bunch of use cases that make  <br>00:19:33.320 notion AI worthwhile to save you time  <br>00:19:35.840 and improve what you do but there are a  <br>00:19:37.840 ton of ways that you can turn notion  <br>00:19:39.679 into the perfect personalized  <br>00:19:42.080 productivity setup say that in a hurry  <br>00:19:44.360 to do that definitely get over to better  <br>00:19:45.919 creating. comom /downloads for my free  <br>00:19:48.799 and
