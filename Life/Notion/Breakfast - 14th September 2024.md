In "The 4-Hour Body" by Tim Ferriss, the recommended breakfast typically emphasizes a high-protein, low-carb diet. Ferriss suggests focusing on foods that help maintain energy levels and support muscle growth, such as eggs, legumes, and vegetables, often avoiding refined carbohydrates and sugars.

### Comparison:

**Current Breakfast:**

- **Protein Sources:** Porchetta (20g protein) and a small amount from sourdough and onions.
- **Carbohydrates:** Sourdough (49g carbohydrates) is the primary source, which is higher than Ferriss's recommendations.
- **Fats:** Mostly from porchetta (25g fat).
- **Micronutrients:** Includes B vitamins, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, Iron, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Zinc, Selenium, Manganese, Potassium, and antioxidants from coffee.

**Ferriss's Recommendations:**

- **Protein Sources:** Emphasis on eggs, legumes, and lean meats.
- **Carbohydrates:** Preferably low, with an emphasis on vegetables for fiber and nutrients.
- **Fats:** Healthy fats from sources such as avocados and nuts.
- **Micronutrients:** Focused on overall nutrient density without refined carbs.

### Summary Rating:

**Rating:** 6/10

**Reasoning:** The breakfast includes a good amount of protein and fats, however, it relies heavily on carbohydrates from sourdough, which is not in line with Ferriss's low-carb approach. Increasing protein sources and reducing refined carbs would align better with Ferriss's dietary principles. Additionally, the inclusion of vegetables with high nutrient density could improve the rating.
