  

### The seductive pull of social norms

  

==**Humans are herd animals. For most of our evolution becoming separated from the tribe or being cast out was a death sentence. The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.**==

  

==**Everyone wants to belong**==

  

==**We imitate the habits of 3 groups in particular:**==

1. ==**The close**==
2. ==**The many**==
3. ==**The powerful**==

### 1. Imitating the close

==**We pick up habits form the people around us**==

  

==**As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits**==

  

==**One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behaviour is the normal behaviour**==

  

==**Your culture set your expectation for what is normal. Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want tot have yourself. You’ll rise together.**==

  

==**Join a culture where your desired behaviour is the normal behaviour and you already have something in common with he group**==

  

==**Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one**==

  

==**Your identity becomes linked to those around you. Growth and change is no longer and individual pursuit.**==

  

==**The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviours last over the long run**==

### 2. Imitating the many

==**Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behaviour.**==

  

==**It’s usually a smart strategy. There is evidence in numbers**==

  

==**The normal behaviour of the tribe often overpowers the desired behaviour of the individual**==

  

==**Humans are similar. There is tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding the truth. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves**==

  

==**The human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along with others. This is our natural mode. You can override it, you can choose to ignore thr group or to stop caring what other people thin but it takes work. Running against the grain of your culture requires extra effort.**==

  

==**When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive**==

  

### 3. Imitating the powerful

  

==**Humans every where pursue power, prestige and status**==

  

==**Historically, a person with greater power and status has access to more resources, worries less about survival, and proves to be a more attractive mate**==

  

> ==**Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out**==

  

==**This is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly effective people. We try to copy the behaviour of successful people because we desire success ourselves**==

  

==**High-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others. And that means if a behaviour can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive**==
