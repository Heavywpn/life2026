prove00:00:02.919 it it's an amazing ingredient that's00:00:04.480 been used for its health benefits for00:00:06.000 example it has impact on visceral fat00:00:07.839 and that belly fat yeah it's the fat00:00:09.440 that's really bad for00:00:10.840 you yeah you're not supposed to do that00:00:13.799 Stephen oh gosh the glucose goddess is00:00:17.119 back Jesse enpay is a biochemist and00:00:19.640 best-selling author with a focus on00:00:21.359 nutrition and glucose management she00:00:23.080 provides simple science-backed tips to00:00:25.119 improve our health 80% of the population00:00:27.560 have glucose spikes every single day and00:00:29.640 that's when problems start happening00:00:30.920 from mental health to acne to faster00:00:32.558 aging infertility and PCOS which is one00:00:35.000 of the leading causes of infertility in00:00:36.760 women and the problem is we're in a00:00:38.280 situation where the food landscape is so00:00:40.000 toxic and most of us just eat sugar and00:00:42.160 starches but they're literally made up00:00:43.800 of glucose molecules is there any such00:00:45.520 thing as good sugar no so even all the00:00:48.079 fruit that we find today in supermarkets00:00:49.879 is not natural some people believe that00:00:51.600 if the sugar is coming from a fruit for00:00:53.320 example in a fruit smoothie that's good00:00:55.559 sugar but that's a total lie and your00:00:57.559 body doesn't differentiate but the sugar00:00:59.280 isn't a fruit smoothie or the sugars in00:01:00.600 a chocolate cake are there any foods00:01:02.160 that have surprised you when you tested00:01:03.680 them yes I think the biggest ones are00:01:07.119 wow this begs the question then is there00:01:09.040 a healthy way to consume sugar so these00:01:11.000 are four hacks that people can Implement00:01:13.159 in their lives and you're able to reduce00:01:14.720 your glucose spikes while still eating00:01:16.240 what you love and you took these hacks00:01:17.920 and did an experiment yes and 90% of00:01:20.360 people reduce their Cravings really00:01:22.000 significant impacts on sleep hormones00:01:24.560 mood on diabetes and it says roughly 40%00:01:27.119 of people who wanted to lose weight did00:01:28.520 in fact lose weight yep so what are the00:01:30.640 hacks the first one00:01:34.200 is this is a sentence I never

lucky people thank you from00:02:22.319 the bottom of my heart let's get to the00:02:26.020 [Music]00:02:27.200 conversation Jesse in chasby the glucose00:02:30.800 goddess we spoke two years ago and in00:02:34.599 that time I feel like there's been a00:02:36.360 real glucose Revolution much of which00:02:38.879 has been led by you your books have sold00:02:40.720 millions and millions and millions of00:02:41.920 copies around the world your00:02:43.560 conversations online have millions and00:02:44.920 millions and millions and millions of00:02:45.920 views more than I could possibly00:02:47.879 count what's going on with glucose the00:02:51.360 thing is glucose has always been00:02:53.599 incredibly important to our health but00:02:56.200 it's been going on behind the scenes but00:02:59.599 now now but with the technology that we00:03:01.080 have glucose monitors new science we're00:03:03.440 actually able to get a real good handle00:03:05.040 on it and understand our diet through00:03:07.599 that lens so most of us Stephen have00:03:11.920 unhealthy glucose levels to give you an00:03:14.000 example one billion people in the world00:03:15.959 have either type two diabetes or00:03:17.959 pre-diabetes one billion and that number00:03:20.680 is increasing every single day and then00:03:22.840 in people who don't have any health00:03:24.400 issues up to 80% of the population still00:03:27.360 has glucose spikes every single day and00:03:30.319 this leads to lots of symptoms from00:03:31.959 mental health problems to fertility to00:03:33.760 acne to faster aging glucose is really00:03:36.400 important and I'm really happy that00:03:37.599 we're talking about it more what have00:03:39.319 you have you been surprised by how much00:03:41.239 people have woken up to glucose sugar00:03:44.120 yeah definitely I think even the word00:03:46.159 glucose people used to know blood sugar00:03:47.879 but now the fact that people know what00:03:49.080 glucose is makes me quite happy that's00:03:51.159 the scientific way to refer to blood00:03:53.640 sugar it's surprising but the thing is00:03:55.799 like I'm on the inside I'm working every00:03:57.599 single day to make sure people know what00:03:58.959 glucose is so it's like you know when00:04:01.079 you put the frog in the water and then00:04:02.560 you slowly boil the water you know that00:04:04.120 image and the Frog doesn't notice the00:04:05.560 water is boiling that's how I feel00:04:07.120 because I've been doing this for five00:04:08.720 years now so I can tell now if I compare00:04:11.720 today to five years ago there's been a00:04:13.200 huge shift but I've been looking at it00:04:15.319 every single day day by day and the00:04:17.798 increase has been very gradual how do00:04:20.600 you define yourself there's this sort of00:04:23.840 name you go under the glucose goddess00:04:26.080 but professionally if someone says what00:04:28.840 you do H how do you define that I say00:04:31.039 I'm a biochemist I'm a biochemist00:04:34.039 passionate about sharing science in a00:04:36.320 fun accessible sexy way that's what I00:04:38.080 like to do these cgms continuous glucose00:04:41.400 monitors that everybody seems to be00:04:43.240 wearing these days they're much of the00:04:46.720 the reason people I guess know you00:04:51.759 because you post these incredible graphs00:04:53.520 on your Instagram showing the impact00:04:55.479 that of the things we on our glucose00:04:58.479 levels yeah I want to start there when I00:05:01.520 eat something sweet and full of sugar00:05:04.199 there's a spike in my CGM so my00:05:06.880 continuous glucose monitor does does the00:05:09.520 spike mean that something bad is going00:05:12.360 on in my body kind of yeah so I'll go00:05:16.919 just one step back there's lots of00:05:19.319 different categories of foods but there00:05:20.960 are two that impact our blood sugar00:05:23.039 levels it's starches so that's bread00:05:26.479 rice pasta potatoes oats and sugars so00:05:30.479 anything sweet from an apple pie turn00:05:32.960 orange juice these two categories of00:05:35.120 foods they're literally made up of00:05:36.919 glucose molecules so when you eat them00:05:39.280 they break down into individual glucose00:05:41.039 molecules and the glucose molecules00:05:42.639 arrive into your blood if you eat a lot00:05:44.840 of starches and sugars at once a lot of00:05:46.919 glucose molecules are arriving into your00:05:48.600 blood and that's what you see that's the00:05:50.680 spike you see on your glucose monitor00:05:53.800 now these Spikes have a few different00:05:56.880 consequences you know having a few00:05:58.800 spikes here and there is not not a big00:06:00.000 deal but if you have really big spikes00:06:01.919 which I think most of us are discovering00:06:03.319 we have even if we don't have diabetes00:06:05.360 that's when problems start happening00:06:06.919 there's basically three processes that00:06:08.440 take place in your body when you spike00:06:10.639 it's chronic fatigue of your00:06:12.520 mitochondria aging glycation and then00:06:15.720 insulin release and I can go into detail00:06:18.000 into these but these are what underpin00:06:20.319 all the negative consequences of glucose00:06:22.400 spikes so start with that first one okay00:06:24.599 the mitochondria so there's these little00:06:26.800 factories in your cells that are in00:06:28.280 charge of making energy you must have00:06:29.800 learned this at school you know the00:06:30.919 mitochondria is the factory of the cell00:06:34.000 these little mitochondria are constantly00:06:36.160 trying to make energy for your body and00:06:38.919 they turn glucose into energy so you00:06:41.680 give them glucose through food they turn00:06:43.199 it into energy and then your brain uses00:06:45.479 the energy your heart to pump your ears00:06:47.680 to listen your eyes to see your whole00:06:50.080 body uses this energy and so you might00:06:52.440 think okay I want lots of energy so I00:06:54.479 should give my mitochondria lots of00:06:55.800 glucose That's The Logical conclusion00:06:57.960 you might come to but that where it00:06:59.919 completely collapses see biology is a00:07:01.639 bit weird take the example of a plant do00:07:04.319 you have any plants at home I do yeah00:07:05.919 okay are you able to keep them alive um00:07:08.319 my cleaning does a great job of keeping00:07:09.639 all them alive I have a super hard time00:07:12.560 but the reason I'm bringing up plants is00:07:14.440 because you know that plants need some00:07:15.919 water to live but if you give them too00:07:18.360 much water they drown and they die the00:07:21.240 human body is kind of the same some00:07:23.520 glucose amazing steady energy too much00:07:26.520 glucose and your little mitochondria00:07:28.680 start freaking out out they get00:07:30.960 overwhelmed by too much glucose Reviving00:07:33.240 their way they kind of go on strike and00:07:35.319 I'm French so I know but they sort of go00:07:37.560 on strike and they get overwhelmed and00:07:39.280 stressed out and they're not able to00:07:40.800 make energy effectively anymore because00:07:42.599 we're overloading them with too much00:07:44.960 glucose to process and as a human what00:07:47.960 do you feel you feel chronic fatigue you00:07:50.879 wake up you're exhausted thinking of00:07:52.599 going to the grocery store or picking up00:07:54.039 your kids is super tiring there's this00:07:57.720 Energy System in your body is just kind00:07:59.360 of of broken but you keep eating carbs00:08:01.639 you know croissant some bread something00:08:03.960 sweet but you keep being more and more00:08:05.919 tired that's your mitochondria00:08:08.080 dysfunctioning so that's the first thing00:08:09.960 that happens when you spike you get00:08:11.960 tired your mitochondria gets stressed00:08:16.199 out and one thing that's interesting is00:08:19.120 that sometimes when we eat something00:08:20.520 sweet especially in the morning like an00:08:21.879 orange juice we kind of feel a sense of00:08:25.520 like a like a rush of energy you know00:08:27.120 you have a big glass of orange juice and00:08:28.639 you sort of perk up for a sec most00:08:30.639 people think that that is energy what's00:08:33.159 actually going on is that Sugar releases00:08:35.640 dopamine in the brain and it's the00:08:37.679 pleasure molecule it's the same molecule00:08:39.440 that gets released when you have sex00:08:41.159 when you play video games when you do00:08:43.159 illegal drugs sugar releases dopamine00:08:46.080 it's pleasure it makes you kind of feel00:08:48.279 awake just briefly but actually that's00:08:50.800 not energy because on the inside your00:08:52.519 mitochondria are being damaged so we're00:08:54.640 being tricked by sugary foods and when00:08:56.399 we're tired we often reach for something00:08:58.600 sugary to per us up but it doesn't work00:09:00.720 on the inside so that's the first thing00:09:03.040 your mitochondria gets stressed out and00:09:05.600 as your mitochondria gets stressed out00:09:07.040 they also release what's called free00:09:08.480 radicals which is something that00:09:10.040 increases inflammation in the body and00:09:11.680 inflammation is really nasty thing we'll00:09:14.120 get to it in a sec the second thing that00:09:16.160 happens when you spike has to do with a00:09:18.440 chicken cooking in the oven so if you00:09:21.079 put you're looking at me weird but let00:09:22.399 me explain if you put a chicken in the00:09:25.000 oven it goes from pink to brown right00:09:28.600 you've seen this it books this process00:09:31.120 of cooking is called glycation it's the00:09:34.399 process of Browning or of cooking same00:09:37.040 thing when you toast a piece of toast00:09:38.399 for00:09:39.200 example the interesting thing is a human00:09:42.360 being from the moment we're born we're00:09:44.720 slowly cooking in that same way on the00:09:48.240 inside we're slowly glycating we're00:09:50.920 slowly Browning and then when we're00:09:53.720 fully glycated when we're fully cooked00:09:57.079 we die that's why when you look at the00:09:59.800 cartilage of babies it's white and if00:10:02.040 you look at the cartilage of somebody00:10:03.320 who's 90 years old it's brown they've00:10:05.600 cooked on the inside and every glucose00:10:08.279 Spike increases you're looking at your00:10:10.160 skin yeah from the outside we'd have to00:10:13.600 like open you up and look at your00:10:14.800 cartilage color got about 10 minutes00:10:18.839 left and every glucose Spike increases00:10:21.320 his process of glycation so much so that00:10:23.600 glucose and glycation they kind of sound00:10:26.120 like a similar word glucose glyc a it's00:10:30.440 because it's glucose doing the glycating00:10:33.920 so every glucose Spike increases00:10:36.519 glycation increases cooking accelerates00:10:39.519 aging and this shows on your skin you00:10:42.639 get wrinkles faster if you glycate more00:10:44.880 and also on the inside your organs00:10:47.079 slowly get damaged so glucose spikes00:10:50.200 mitochondria get tired you age00:10:53.320 faster in response to this your body00:10:56.480 knows Stephen that a big glucose spike00:10:58.880 is not good for you your body knows that00:11:01.279 it has to do something to try to get00:11:03.000 that glucose level down so what it does00:11:05.880 it calls up your pancreas and it's like00:11:08.000 yo pancreas we got a glucose bike going00:11:09.880 on we need to get this glucose down in00:11:12.839 response your pancreas sends a hormone00:11:14.880 called insulin out in your body you've00:11:17.079 heard of insulin before right and00:11:19.320 insulin's job and we love her her job is00:11:21.680 to grab all these excess glucose00:11:24.079 molecules and to store them away so they00:11:27.480 don't damage your body anymore and00:11:29.760 Insulin stores glucose away into your00:11:32.560 liver into your muscles and then when00:11:35.600 those are full insulin stores glucose00:11:38.000 away into your fat cells and that's one00:11:41.120 of the ways that you gain fat on your00:11:43.680 body it's in response to the spikes and00:11:46.000 your body trying to protect you from the00:11:48.079 spikes the problem is insulin itself has00:11:51.680 consequences and is the driver of type00:11:54.160 two diabetes and insulin resistance so00:11:56.600 to answer your question yes when you see00:11:58.480 a big spike on your glucose monitor00:12:00.600 there's some of that going on and the00:12:02.320 more spikes you have the harder it is00:12:04.120 going to be for your body to manage your00:12:05.680 spikes so it kind of becomes a vicious00:12:07.600 cycle if you keep eating the same way00:12:09.519 your spice will get bigger and bigger00:12:11.120 and bigger and bigger over time with00:12:12.760 more and more damage on that last point00:12:14.880 about where insulin stores the excess00:12:17.720 glucose does that mean that if I have00:12:19.279 more muscle mass I'm better at eating00:12:23.680 sugary products yep and that's why if00:12:26.480 you really love cookies the best time to00:12:28.399 eat them is right after you work out00:12:30.199 right before you work out because your00:12:32.120 muscles are really hungry for glucose00:12:33.880 all the time and the bigger your muscles00:12:35.440 are the more you use them the more00:12:37.440 they're going to capture some of that00:12:38.880 glucose for energy okay so me and my00:12:41.639 partner we both go to the gym she is00:12:43.440 significantly smaller than me in every00:12:44.639 way she's she's short she's you know00:12:47.279 she's lean um I'm bigger than her I have00:12:50.399 I have more muscle mass that means that00:12:52.480 if I have one cookie and she has the00:12:54.199 exact same cookie then her glucose00:12:56.680 response is going to be potentially00:12:58.000 significantly different to mine00:12:59.959 yes potentially so if you just look at00:13:02.000 muscle mass since you have more muscle00:13:03.639 mass you'll be able to handle that00:13:04.920 cookie better but there's so many things00:13:07.079 that influence glucose response for00:13:08.800 example your level of hydration how00:13:11.240 stressed you are your microbiome your00:13:13.279 genetics what time of the month you're00:13:14.920 in when you're female how well you've00:13:17.240 slept last night I mean there's a few00:13:19.560 factors so if you were just to compare00:13:21.360 your Spike to hers you couldn't really00:13:23.399 draw any conclusions because there's so00:13:25.720 many confounding variables there's00:13:28.000 confounding variables give me a window00:13:29.839 into some of them and why they matter00:13:31.360 and how they have an impact on my00:13:32.440 glucose00:13:33.440 response so I think muscles is a really00:13:35.839 good example right if two people eat the00:13:37.680 same exact cookie the person with more00:13:39.680 muscle mass is going to potentially see00:13:41.680 a smaller glucose Spike because their00:13:43.800 muscles are going to absorb more of that00:13:45.480 glucose and faster if you look at00:13:48.120 genetics some people are better at00:13:50.560 growing their fat cells and at growing00:13:52.680 the number and the size of their fat00:13:54.440 cells so they have a bigger Reservoir to00:13:57.160 put glucose in people of South Asian00:13:59.399 descent for example they tend to have a00:14:01.399 harder time putting on fat cells and as00:14:04.240 a result their glucose spikes tend to be00:14:06.360 bigger because they don't have that00:14:07.839 storage unit that they can access and00:14:10.320 increase the size of does that make00:14:11.880 sense yeah yeah yeah are there any foods00:14:15.399 that you have been surprised at when00:14:17.920 you've tested them because this is one00:14:19.680 of the really shocking things that I00:14:22.240 discovered when I wore a continuous00:14:23.360 glucose monitor is I would eat some00:14:25.759 things that I've been eating for a long00:14:27.839 long time and they would cause a spike00:14:29.839 and I like what I thought that was00:14:31.199 healthy yeah um but what are those00:14:33.600 things I guess for the suris the00:14:35.240 surprising ones not just for you but for00:14:36.880 people that message you and go oh my God00:14:38.639 Jesse I've been lied to about my tomato00:14:40.839 ketchup or okay I think the biggest ones00:14:42.959 are honey and grapes okay so grapes00:14:46.680 first you think it's a fruit it's00:14:49.399 healthy it's natural it's good for me00:14:51.120 right well actually all the fruit that00:14:53.519 we find today in supermarkets is not00:14:55.440 natural it is the product of human00:14:58.320 breeding for thousands and thousands of00:15:00.160 years to make them extra sweet extra00:15:02.519 juicy in the same way that humans have00:15:04.600 been breeding dogs from the time of the00:15:06.720 gray wolves into Chihuahua and Golden00:15:09.199 Retrievers these are not natural types00:15:11.880 of dogs we've bred wolves into these00:15:14.240 dogs fruit is the same thing we've bred00:15:17.360 pces of fruit to make these beautiful00:15:19.759 grapes without any seeds and just this00:15:22.199 little pocket of sugar and so a grape00:15:24.199 when you look at it actually it's just a00:15:26.199 big dose of sugar it's in the fruit00:15:29.199 format so people think it's good for00:15:30.480 them but actually when it comes to your00:15:31.680 glucose levels it's just big glucose00:15:34.360 Spike so those are really surprising all00:15:37.399 fruits it varies right so for example00:15:40.639 berries are lower in Sugar so create a00:15:43.120 smaller Spike but any tropical fruit00:15:45.600 like bananas mangoes papayas and then00:15:48.440 grapes also those are really high in00:15:50.279 sugar yeah but the thing is you know00:15:51.880 piece of whole fruit is okay because it00:15:54.079 has fiber in it the real problem comes00:15:56.759 when you denature that piece of fruit00:15:58.360 and you turn it into a juice for example00:16:00.639 cuz then you're removing that protective00:16:02.279 fiber just extracting the water and the00:16:04.480 sugar yeah I've not drank a glass of00:16:06.440 juice since starting this podcast00:16:07.959 because so many people have spoken to00:16:09.240 have told me that it's just like00:16:10.199 drinking sugar water yeah it's just like00:16:11.959 drinking a can of Coke but people think00:16:13.360 well it comes from a piece of fruit so00:16:15.240 it's natural orange juice comes from00:16:16.959 oranges therefore it's good for you00:16:18.920 because it's natural what they don't00:16:20.319 realize is that the sugar in a can of00:16:22.600 soda is also natural it comes from sugar00:16:25.639 beets or canes so if you're you're00:16:29.079 really looking at the source of the00:16:30.279 sugar you realize it doesn't matter at00:16:31.759 all they all come from plants what00:16:33.319 matters is the concentration and the00:16:35.240 medium that the sugar is in I understand00:16:38.600 grapes causing a glucose Spike because00:16:40.720 when I taste it it tastes sweet but00:16:43.079 there's some things that I eat that00:16:44.519 don't taste sweet that cause a glucose00:16:46.480 Spike and those are the things that I00:16:48.120 think lie to me like bread like bread00:16:50.560 like rice yeah well the thing is glucose00:16:53.399 is actually not sweet what you're00:16:55.279 tasting in fruit is fructose so let me00:16:58.199 explain so starches like bread pasta00:17:02.040 rice potatoes00:17:04.119 oats those are starches those are00:17:06.679 literally millions of glucose molecules00:17:09.439 just attached hand to hand like this00:17:12.359 that's a starch it's just a long chain00:17:14.000 of glucose when you eat the starch poof00:17:16.480 it turns into individual glucose00:17:17.880 molecules raises your blood sugar even00:17:19.959 though it doesn't taste sweet in a piece00:17:22.199 of fruit or in Sugar you're not eating00:17:24.839 starch what you're eating is sucrose00:17:27.599 different kind of molecule which which00:17:28.960 is half glucose half00:17:32.160 fructose yeah so when it breaks down it00:17:34.679 gives you glucose and a spike but also00:17:36.880 fructose that tastes really sweet but00:17:39.559 doesn't raise your blood sugar levels00:17:41.080 that much so again on the other side of00:17:43.480 the queen then are there foods that00:17:45.360 taste sweet but don't have an impact on00:17:47.000 my glucose yes00:17:48.919 sweeteners Stevia aspartame things like00:17:51.960 that so you saying that I should put00:17:54.880 sweeters in my food as opposed to Sugar00:17:58.240 well I think people need to realize that00:18:00.120 even though sweeteners are not super00:18:01.440 good for us right of course it's better00:18:02.960 to drink water than a diet soda the diet00:18:05.720 soda is better for you than the regular00:18:07.760 can of soda with the 30 grams of real00:18:09.880 sugar in there I personally would never00:18:13.200 have a can of real soda I would always00:18:15.159 have the diet soda always always always00:18:17.760 because those sweeteners don't raise00:18:20.159 your blood sugar levels okay they don't00:18:22.159 create that big spike and that big00:18:23.559 insulin Spike and then the drop is there00:18:26.200 such a good thing as good sugar m00:18:29.960 is there any such thing as good00:18:31.919 sugar00:18:33.520 no people often believe that if the00:18:36.400 sugar is coming from a fruit and is is00:18:38.640 for example in a fruit smoothie that00:18:40.440 they might have in the morning that's00:18:41.960 good sugar but that Sugar that's in a00:18:43.520 cake is bad sugar so people tend to00:18:46.960 compare these two and say oh well I'm00:18:49.159 having a fruit smoothie that's good for00:18:50.520 me but oh that chocolate cake would be00:18:52.080 bad for me that's a total lie it's all00:18:54.600 the same molecules the molecules in that00:18:57.039 fruit smoothie and the molecules in that00:18:59.039 chocolate cake are the same it's sucrose00:19:01.360 it's the same stuff and your body00:19:02.960 doesn't differentiate whether the sugar00:19:05.280 is in a fruit smoothie or the sugar is00:19:06.760 in a chocolate cake so all sugar is the00:19:09.679 same even you know honey Agave maple00:19:12.919 syrup all these things that have these00:19:14.520 Health Halos because of marketing it's00:19:16.440 all the same molecules so I recommend00:19:19.240 that people just have the sugar that00:19:20.600 they like best don't think that one is00:19:22.880 going to be better for you than the00:19:24.039 other and have all sugar as dessert so00:19:26.960 that fruit smoothie that's also dessert00:19:28.720 dessert it's not super healthy because00:19:30.400 it comes from fruits it's just like the00:19:31.880 chocolate cake and are there is there00:19:34.080 such a thing as good sweetness and bad00:19:36.000 sweetness yeah so there's a few00:19:37.400 categories so the ones that seem to be00:19:39.320 really fine for us are Stevia monk fruit00:19:43.039 and allulose the ones that have been00:19:45.799 linked to quite a few health issues are00:19:48.960 aspartame ml sucralose so for example a00:19:53.440 Spartan you usually find it in soda00:19:55.679 whereas Stevia you might buy a little00:19:57.320 packet at home and put it in your tea00:19:59.880 that being said the spart tame is still00:20:02.799 better for you than the real can of coke00:20:04.840 with a 30 grams of real sugar so Stevia00:20:06.960 is something that I shouldn't be no00:20:08.760 Stevia is good yeah you shouldn't be too00:20:10.159 concern do you use Stevia I didn't put00:20:12.039 any Sweetness in anything I didn't put00:20:13.440 sugar in anything either so I'm trying00:20:15.240 to stay away have coffee it's just black00:20:17.000 coffee you don't even eat chocolate of00:20:19.080 course I chocolate maybe not so much00:20:21.320 maybe that's not my thing but what's00:20:23.400 your sweet thing carrot cake what's your00:20:26.240 sweet thing oh chocolate I love00:20:28.120 chocolate like my favorite is is like00:20:29.960 chocolate ice cream with a chocolate00:20:31.480 brownie and chocolate sauce and00:20:32.960 chocolate sprinkles anything chocolate00:20:35.039 that's not very glucose godess well00:20:37.159 here's where you're wrong Stephen I'm00:20:38.640 actually not anti- sugar what are you00:20:40.320 talking about no I love sugar I eat00:20:42.840 sugar I eat carbs all the time but I00:20:44.679 want people to know what I know which is00:20:47.440 how and when to eat those things that's00:20:49.159 the end of the podcast thank you so much00:20:51.600 really great to see you00:20:54.360 again seriously we need to learn how to00:20:57.480 eat these things cuz they're so00:20:58.679 delicious in a way that's less bad for00:21:00.200 our health it's not about cutting them00:21:01.559 out that would be a diet I don't I'm not00:21:03.320 I'm not pro diets I'm Pro knowledge and00:21:06.039 I want to make sure people are not00:21:06.960 having sugar and dessert for breakfast00:21:09.000 you know sweet cereal in the morning and00:21:10.799 orange juice that's dessert anyway I'm00:21:13.840 all about just trying to empower people00:21:15.159 with the information so they don't get00:21:16.840 trapped by these marketing lies are we00:21:20.120 meant to be eating the amounts of sugar00:21:22.400 that we eat though like are we meant to00:21:24.039 be eating any sugar is what does our00:21:26.080 sort of evolutionary history tell us00:21:27.600 about our relationship with glucose I00:21:29.559 think fruit is something we're meant to00:21:31.279 be eating but the fruit that used to00:21:32.840 exist was less sweet and harder to00:21:35.600 digest and more fibrous and then in00:21:37.440 terms of starches starches are totally00:21:39.200 fine to eat the problem is today most of00:21:41.200 us just eat sugar and starches we've00:21:43.480 completely lost touch with the nice00:21:46.000 proteins and the organ meats and the00:21:48.320 fiber and the healthy fats we're in a00:21:50.360 situation where the food landscape is so00:21:52.120 toxic and it's so just starches and00:21:54.400 sugars that people are getting sicker00:21:55.760 and sicker and sicker and it's addictive00:21:58.080 and it's cheap so we're in a very00:22:00.600 difficult situation and that's the00:22:02.080 situation that you know the gp1s are00:22:03.880 trying to solve we're in a pickle we are00:22:06.360 in a pickle are you optimistic about the00:22:08.960 pickle we're in as it relates to sugar00:22:10.679 and00:22:13.880 Creos I have to say yes because the00:22:16.400 amount of Transformations I see in my00:22:18.919 readers is really encouraging you know00:22:21.320 people are reclaiming their health00:22:22.679 getting power over it understanding food00:22:25.200 again but we've got a lot of work to do00:22:27.400 and I can do my work educating people00:22:29.400 from the ground up on these hacks but we00:22:31.159 also need like systemic change we need00:22:33.039 policy we need governments to get00:22:35.320 involved and we need to find ways to00:22:37.320 make healthier food because we're just00:22:38.799 killing the population right now it's00:22:40.279 really terrible so talking about some of00:22:42.960 the consequences of a high glucose diet00:22:47.679 one of them you mentioned earlier when00:22:48.919 we were talking about glycation is00:22:51.360 aging has anyone ever done any research00:22:54.000 to prove that a high glucose diet is00:22:57.279 associated with correlated with00:23:00.279 increased or accelerated aging I mean00:23:03.159 yes because we see that the people who00:23:04.720 eat the most sugar get the most diseases00:23:08.240 right so we see correlations but they're00:23:09.919 not they're not like a clinical trial00:23:11.600 you can't take two populations and say00:23:13.440 okay everybody's 30 years old we're00:23:15.279 going to give this half a healthy no00:23:17.679 glucose Spike diet and this half glucose00:23:19.919 spikes every single day and then we'll00:23:21.480 see when they're 80 you know which group00:23:23.279 has aged faster we can't do that that's00:23:25.200 unethical so we have to look at00:23:27.039 correlations and we see things like if00:23:29.600 you have really high glucose levels High00:23:31.440 insulin levels you're more likely to get00:23:33.080 heart disease dementia depression etc00:23:36.360 etc we have correlative studies and we00:23:39.600 understand the mechanism of the00:23:41.080 glycation what about the superficial00:23:43.120 signs of aging wrinkles like the00:23:45.200 wrinkles a lot of skincare products00:23:47.440 actually Target glycation from the00:23:48.880 outside in so they'll put like00:23:50.360 antioxidants on your skin to reduce00:23:52.760 glycation if you're in the skincare00:23:54.200 World you'll see glycation mentioned00:23:55.760 everywhere what they don't do is they00:23:57.720 don't look at at how to reduce glycation00:24:00.320 from the inside out which is what I00:24:02.720 think is more interesting and it's00:24:04.279 through food by reducing your glucose00:24:06.000 levels you reduce glycation it's just00:24:08.000 like a A to B it's very simple so if I00:24:11.440 want to Stave off wrinkles then I should00:24:14.400 keep my glucose levels down yes and you00:24:16.559 should also avoid smoking you know wear00:24:18.720 sunscreen Etc but in terms of your diet00:24:20.960 what you want to focus on is focus on00:24:22.600 reducing glucose spikes yeah absolutely00:24:24.799 what about things like acne and skin00:24:26.799 conditions so those are more00:24:28.480 inflammatory based diseases so eczema00:24:31.720 psoriasis acne rosacea those are00:24:35.200 expressions of inflammation going on00:24:38.159 within your body and I like to think of00:24:39.720 the skin as a mirror to what's going on00:24:42.799 within and so inflamation can happen to00:24:45.600 loads of different factors but one of00:24:47.120 the factors is glucose spikes so glucose00:24:49.520 spikes hurt our mitochondria that00:24:51.840 creates inflammation then glucose spikes00:24:54.279 lead to glycation which also leads to00:24:56.159 inflammation and Insulin release and a00:24:58.600 lot of insulin also increases00:25:00.279 inflammation so with every glucose Spike00:25:02.200 you're increasing inflammation within00:25:04.320 your body and if you're susceptible to00:25:06.279 any of these skin conditions you can00:25:07.679 have fups or increase their intensity00:25:09.679 very simply and does it also have an00:25:12.640 impact on my hormonal balance I am a lot00:25:15.640 of my friends I'm in that age range now00:25:17.039 where a lot of my friends are trying to00:25:18.320 have children yeah and there's so much00:25:21.120 talk around things like polycystic ovary00:25:23.960 syndrome and fertility and you know00:25:27.720 infertility in men with their sperm and00:25:29.440 all these kinds of things is there a00:25:30.760 link between glucose and hormones and00:25:34.039 fertility yes so we have studies that00:25:36.440 show that the more insulin resistant you00:25:38.919 are so insulin resistance is a00:25:40.559 consequence of just a lot of insulin in00:25:42.200 the body the more likely you are to be00:25:43.960 infertile and then we also know that00:25:47.279 PCOS so polycystic ovarian syndrome00:25:49.320 which is one of the leading causes of00:25:51.080 infertility in women we know that 60% of00:25:53.919 PCOS cases also are people who have00:25:57.840 insulin resistance there's a link there00:26:00.559 insulin resistance you're more likely to00:26:02.399 have PCOS and we also know that when00:26:04.799 there's a lot of insulin in a female00:26:06.520 body it tells your ovaries to produce00:26:09.840 more testosterone testosterone is the00:26:12.720 male sex hormone and if you have too00:26:14.880 much male sex hormone in the body that00:26:17.360 causes issues it can cause acne it can00:26:19.679 cause balding or hair growth on the face00:26:21.960 and it can stop your period now often00:26:24.919 when somebody has PCOS they're given the00:26:26.880 birth control pill00:26:28.760 which kind of makes sense on the surface00:26:30.480 but really doesn't solve anything what00:26:32.279 happens when you take the birth control00:26:33.480 pill is that you're just ingesting00:26:35.120 female hormones that's what the pill is00:26:37.240 it's female hormones so if you have high00:26:39.640 testosterone all of a sudden you're00:26:41.320 ingesting female hormones so the balance00:26:44.320 kind of comes back to an okay situation00:26:46.960 your symptoms of excess testosterone go00:26:50.039 away but as soon as you stop the pill00:26:53.000 the high testosterone is still there so00:26:55.320 a lot of people stop the pill trying to00:26:57.279 have a baby and they're like oh00:26:58.799 I don't have my period I have PCOS what00:27:01.919 do I do so one recommendation I have is00:27:04.559 if you have PCOS look at your glucose00:27:06.360 bikes first it's not the only reason00:27:08.480 this can happen but very often when you00:27:10.799 fix your glucose and insulin levels the00:27:12.919 symptoms of PCOS go away I was saw00:27:15.880 something on Twitter a couple of weeks00:27:16.919 ago that was trying to make the case00:27:19.159 that glucose and Insulin responses are00:27:23.760 the reason for PCOS yeah some people00:27:26.799 believe that totally you know it's a00:27:29.000 very politically charged topic some00:27:31.840 people believe you have PCOS it's00:27:34.200 genetic you can't do anything about it00:27:35.960 other people believe no no it's a00:27:37.279 metabolic disease it's a cluster of00:27:39.120 symptoms that come from high insulin I'm00:27:40.919 in that camp but you know there are some00:27:43.519 cases where somebody has PCOS and00:27:45.159 doesn't have high insulin levels so what00:27:47.480 category do they go into the thing with00:27:49.279 PCOS Stephen is that it's not a real00:27:51.720 Condition it's like a cluster of00:27:53.120 symptoms so some people could have PCOS00:27:55.559 and have cystic ovaries and balding00:27:57.840 somebody else could have PCOS and have00:27:59.840 you know missed periods and hair growth00:28:02.000 on their chin so it can take different00:28:04.559 forms so I think we're starting to00:28:06.399 understand there there variations of00:28:08.320 PCOS and some are in the insulin00:28:10.399 resistant category have you seen a woman00:28:13.120 res reverse have PCOS symptoms tons in00:28:16.039 my second book I ran a study three00:28:19.159 females who were in the program doing my00:28:21.200 hacks for just a month got their period00:28:24.200 back and were able to get pregnant in00:28:26.760 that month just with my hacks I see PCOS00:28:29.200 reversal all the00:28:31.279 time so these hacks that you you say00:28:34.039 those three women use to help reverse00:28:36.440 their their PCOS00:28:38.480 symptoms what are the hacks oh the hacks00:28:42.120 what are the ones that they did so the00:28:43.720 ones they did were Savory00:28:46.399 breakfast vinegar once a day veggie00:28:50.039 starters and moving after eating and00:28:53.360 these are four hacks that are the four00:28:56.399 most important ones of my 10 hacks that00:28:59.320 I've put together in the four-week00:29:00.760 method that second00:29:02.760 book and if you do these hacks you don't00:29:06.080 actually have to change anything else00:29:07.399 that you're eating you don't have to cut00:29:08.919 out anything you just add these in I00:29:11.200 like to see them like um little fairy00:29:13.840 godmothers that you have in your pocket00:29:15.200 and you just put throughout your day00:29:16.320 like this and you're able to reduce your00:29:17.960 glucose spikes while still eating what00:29:19.600 you love in a very low efforts kind of00:29:21.840 way and I believe these hacks should be00:29:23.880 seen like you would00:29:25.440 see brush your teeth wear sunscreen00:29:28.640 drink enough water have a Savory00:29:30.240 breakfast move after eating have a00:29:32.000 Savory breakfast so are you saying00:29:34.120 people shouldn't be eating sugar for00:29:35.399 breakfast correct so the concept of a00:29:37.600 savory breakfast comes from the simple00:29:40.080 realization that if you have a breakfast00:29:43.360 that creates a big glucose Spike you're00:29:45.720 affecting your body in many bad ways00:29:48.760 first of all you're leading to your00:29:50.480 brain not functioning too well during00:29:52.480 that day it's leading to brain fog it00:29:54.519 can make you a bit confused second it00:29:56.399 makes you tired it increases Cravings00:29:58.919 throughout the day and it also00:30:00.440 deregulates your glucose levels for the00:30:02.840 rest of the day your breakfast is very00:30:05.039 powerful if you have a glucose bike at00:30:07.120 breakfast your whole day is a glucose00:30:09.279 roller coaster so what you want to do00:30:11.080 Stephen is always have a Savory00:30:13.440 breakfast that keeps your glucose level00:30:15.080 steady a Savory breakfast is what it's00:30:17.360 based around00:30:18.600 protein eggs uh fish meat tofu nuts00:30:23.360 Dairy protein powder dinner leftovers00:30:25.640 okay protein it's really important to00:30:27.600 have protein in the morning then you add00:30:29.399 some healthy fats olive oil butter00:30:31.840 avocado and then if you want for taste00:30:34.960 you can add a bit of starch like a piece00:30:37.080 of bread for example or some potatoes00:30:39.960 importantly a Savory breakfast contains00:30:42.159 nothing sweet no cereal no muffins no00:30:44.880 orange juice no granola no fruit puree00:30:48.960 none of that it's really key sugar in my00:30:51.080 coffee no no no no if you want sugar00:30:54.720 have it as dessert after a meal after00:30:57.360 lunch or after after dinner because00:30:59.159 after your lunch and after your dinner00:31:00.760 you have lots of food already in the00:31:02.279 digestive system so any sugar you put in00:31:05.159 afterwards is going to impact your00:31:06.639 glucose levels less you said that if I00:31:09.840 have something sweet for my breakfast00:31:11.240 I'm then going to be on a glucose roller00:31:12.760 coaster yeah why because glucose Spike00:31:17.320 then insulin comes out and your glucose00:31:19.720 drop then your glucose are low here you00:31:23.360 get really hungry you have a lot of00:31:24.960 cravings when our glucose levels are00:31:26.799 dropping scientists have shown it00:31:28.600 increases the activity of the craving00:31:30.279 Center in our brain so it goes like00:31:32.519 Stephen eat some sugar and you can't00:31:35.399 control that so what you do you reach00:31:37.440 for more sugar bam another glucose Spike00:31:40.399 and then you just continue your whole00:31:42.080 day like that so you sort of put00:31:44.399 yourself into a corner if you start your00:31:46.159 day with a spike and it's really00:31:47.639 difficult to get off that roller coaster00:31:50.000 does that roller coaster last across00:31:52.960 days good question generally during the00:31:55.760 night is sort of resets and my glucose00:31:58.279 test I saw that when I go to sleep it00:31:59.760 kind of flattens out kind of goes quite00:32:01.120 low at night time00:32:03.960 however I've got this unscientific00:32:06.679 observation where if I start if I had a00:32:09.360 carrot cake now um there's a high00:32:11.880 probability that I'd probably want to00:32:13.159 have a carrot cake by dinner time00:32:14.360 tonight as well and then when I wake up00:32:16.639 the next day I probably I'm going to be00:32:19.000 more likely to go for the carrot cake00:32:20.279 again and I if I if I zoomed out on my00:32:22.720 life say the whole 12 months of a year00:32:25.880 there will be maybe like this little00:32:28.279 week or two in clusters where maybe00:32:31.200 there's a couple of months in between00:32:32.240 and then there's this two we [ __ ]00:32:33.919 Splurge again where I find it really00:32:36.080 hard not to reach for something across00:32:38.399 multiple days now I'm not sure if this00:32:40.039 is in my head I think there's a few00:32:41.760 things going on one The Taste is really00:32:43.639 addictive so you get addicted to getting00:32:45.720 that taste and getting the dopamine00:32:47.159 don't forget there's the dopamine rush00:32:48.600 in your brain second with every glucose00:32:50.960 Spike you're actually deregulating your00:32:52.559 hunger hormones so you get you have more00:32:54.919 Cravings you're hungrier and yes this00:32:56.440 can totally last for a few days and I00:32:58.440 think thirdly if you have the carrot00:32:59.840 cake at home for a few days maybe you're00:33:01.720 just more likely to reach for it because00:33:02.960 it's there you know but I feel I feel00:33:04.679 similarly to you I have these phases00:33:07.480 especially if I'm really busy and I00:33:08.679 can't do all the hacks all the time00:33:10.279 where I'm eating a bunch of sugar and00:33:12.000 then it lasts until I say okay stop back00:33:14.519 on the hacks and I do the hacks for two00:33:16.039 days and then I'm good again that's the00:33:17.960 same with me but also I find that if I00:33:19.799 do a really big workout yeah for me it00:33:22.080 helps to break that cycle so if I this00:33:24.799 weekend I did a re I was I think I was00:33:26.279 in that cycle of like I wasn't reaching00:33:28.840 for sugar as in like something sweet I00:33:30.880 was reaching for like I was having a lot00:33:32.120 of like toast with my breakfast or I was00:33:33.880 having like carbs and then I did a00:33:36.240 really big workout and the last thing I00:33:37.880 wanted was anything with carbs in or00:33:39.720 glucose I think it's also in the brain00:33:41.399 you know cuz you're rebalancing those00:33:43.840 hormones that dopamine you're getting00:33:45.399 endorphins from the workout so you're00:33:47.320 not seeking all that pleasure from just00:33:49.399 sugar okay I think if you're in a cycle00:33:51.279 where all you're just getting dopamine00:33:52.919 from sugar it just becomes addictive and00:33:54.399 you have to do stuff in your life that00:33:55.840 allows you to feel good in your brain00:33:57.279 without having that sugar so maybe I got00:33:59.399 the dopamine from the workout instead00:34:01.559 totally and so I kind of shifted yeah00:34:04.200 the source of dopamine so that was the00:34:06.080 first hack which is Theory breakfast00:34:08.719 Super Key by the way if you just do one00:34:10.918 hack do this one it is a complete00:34:13.199 GameChanger and a Savory breakfast00:34:15.440 should keep you satiated for 4 hours00:34:18.199 which is a long time most people get00:34:20.480 hungry again 2 hours after they have00:34:22.839 breakfast so make sure you're having00:34:24.599 enough protein in your breakfast to stay00:34:26.199 full for four hours00:34:28.239 okay on that what if I fast totally fine00:34:31.679 make sure the first meal of your day is00:34:33.399 also Savory so it can be at 8 a.m. it00:34:35.520 can be at 4 P.M I do not care as long as00:34:38.159 the first thing that you eat is00:34:39.520 something Savory because when you're00:34:41.280 fasted your digestive system is super00:34:43.760 empty and sensitive so whatever you give00:34:46.000 it whether it's in the morning after00:34:47.440 just sleeping or whether it's after a00:34:48.918 two week fast is going to go really00:34:50.960 quickly into your bloodstream so you00:34:52.399 have to be cautious and make sure you're00:34:54.599 not giving your body glucose otherwise00:34:57.200 big [ __ ] do you think fasting is good00:35:00.240 for you inent00:35:02.520 fasting I think it's nuanced I think00:35:05.040 what I've seen is that in men it just00:35:07.079 works way better in females it can kind00:35:10.440 of mess up your hormones you have to be00:35:12.000 a bit um judicious about when you fast00:35:15.359 and we also have to remember guys00:35:17.480 fasting is a stressor on the body it is00:35:20.440 a good stressor but it is a stressor so00:35:23.520 if you have an intense job kids to take00:35:26.680 care of you drink coffee you have you00:35:29.119 know three times a week you do hit00:35:31.200 cardio then you do a sauna then you do a00:35:33.359 cul lunch then you fast your body is00:35:35.240 going to freak the [ __ ] out you have to00:35:36.960 like dose these stressors in a way that00:35:39.920 is going to be manageable for your body00:35:41.599 I see lots of women who do all those00:35:43.560 things I just mentioned and then they're00:35:45.160 like and I don't have my perod and I00:35:46.560 don't understand I don't feel good I'm00:35:47.960 like your body is freaking out like00:35:50.560 relax you can't be putting all these00:35:52.640 stressors on yourself all the time so I00:35:55.200 fast when I'm on vacation and what kind00:35:57.839 of fasting do you do I like we'll skip a00:35:59.880 meal we'll skip dinner we'll skip00:36:01.480 breakfast and it just helps your body00:36:03.599 clean up its dead cells and it's really00:36:05.520 helpful but we have to remember that00:36:08.800 fasting is a stressor it has great00:36:10.920 benefits but you don't have to fast in00:36:13.280 order to be healthy it's very important00:36:15.240 to also look at what you're eating00:36:17.000 because if you're fasting 16 hours a day00:36:19.400 and then you're just eating junk food00:36:21.200 it's not going to be helpful to your00:36:22.480 body we have to do both in combination00:36:24.839 do you fast naturally yeah so I haven't00:36:28.440 eaten today what time are we we 1:00 um00:36:31.280 and I won't eat until you've had a00:36:33.480 coffee I've had a coffee this morning00:36:36.119 yeah but I won't eat until what 400 p.m.00:36:39.000 5:00 p.m. which will be probably you00:36:40.839 know after I get back to the office and00:36:42.400 stuff like that you feel good I feel00:36:43.880 fine so that's the thing right my00:36:45.760 recommendation is if you feel great Fab00:36:48.119 if you feel stressed out if you feel00:36:49.520 light-headed if it feels hard yeah then00:36:51.800 don't do it your body can't handle it00:36:53.000 just doesn't cross my mind to eat I00:36:54.319 don't know how people eat it's amazing00:36:56.040 yeah then go for it live your life Man00:36:58.560 live your life Stephen what about00:36:59.720 calorie restriction do you think much00:37:01.000 about that I mean it works right if you00:37:03.079 if few calories you're going to lose00:37:05.760 weight but this is one of my favorite00:37:08.079 stories do you know how calories were00:37:11.520 invented maybe okay they like put it in00:37:13.880 a box and burnt it they put yes I I told00:37:16.160 you that yes so back in the day to00:37:18.880 measure calories what do you want to00:37:20.079 measure the calorie of tell me something00:37:21.920 some my food car cake00:37:24.319 okay okay so if we were back in the day00:37:26.800 like 100 years ago and we wanted to00:37:28.040 measure the calories in your carrot cake00:37:29.680 here's what we would do we would take00:37:31.119 the carrot cake put it in a box then put00:37:33.760 this box in an aquarium filled with00:37:36.680 water so you have the aquarium and then00:37:39.520 inside you have the box with the carrot00:37:40.920 cake then we would light the carrot cake00:37:43.720 on fire inside the small box and measure00:37:47.160 by how many degrees the water in the00:37:49.520 aquarium increased in temperature so00:37:52.599 we're just measuring the heat that is00:37:56.079 created when we burn the carrot cake00:37:58.880 that is how we measure calories by how00:38:01.319 much heat is generated when you burn a00:38:03.319 food so if you were to put in that same00:38:05.480 box I don't know three avocados and you00:38:07.760 burnt them you might get the same00:38:10.000 temperature increase in the water so you00:38:11.440 might say oh this carrot cake and these00:38:12.920 three avocados have the same number of00:38:14.760 calories but the thing is with the00:38:16.280 calorie thing it's not actually telling00:38:18.119 you what's in the food it's just00:38:20.400 measuring energy that dissipated when00:38:22.839 you burnt it it's not telling you the00:38:25.079 carrot cake is going to lead to a big00:38:26.680 glucose Spike going to make you inflamed00:38:28.960 age faster release insulin whereas the00:38:31.079 three avocados will keep you steady and00:38:32.680 feeling better so two people can be00:38:35.160 eating 2,000 calories diets one person00:38:38.480 can be eating in a way that keeps their00:38:39.960 glucose nice and steady they feel good00:38:42.480 good energy F Cravings clear brain not00:38:45.599 super hungry all the time the other00:38:47.440 person can be eating just glucose00:38:49.000 spiking food and they're having a00:38:50.240 terrible time they're hungry constantly00:38:52.560 they have cravings brain fog insulin00:38:54.400 release so calories are interesting but00:38:57.160 they're not not everything we need to00:38:58.240 teach people about the molecules in00:38:59.760 their food I find that to be a much00:39:01.960 easier way to try to eat a bit less if00:39:04.000 you're trying to lose some fat is to00:39:06.160 just focus on your glucose levels00:39:07.440 because naturally your hunger hormones00:39:09.760 will rebalance you'll have few cravings00:39:11.359 and it's much easier to eat less is00:39:14.280 there a story that you've been sent or a00:39:16.240 case study from someone that's followed00:39:17.880 your work that's stuck with you someone00:39:20.040 that's understood their glucose and had00:39:21.760 a big shift in their life I imagine00:39:23.119 there's thousands but yeah there's many00:39:26.359 many I think for there's two things for00:39:28.720 me there's the the pregnancy stories00:39:30.839 because I think that's so touching00:39:31.920 because I've had many friends go through00:39:33.920 difficult fertility Journeys and to hear00:39:36.319 people who were about to embark on00:39:38.400 really intense fertility treatments and00:39:39.960 just tried this and then got pregnant I00:39:41.319 think that's really cool and then second00:39:43.400 I think it's the people00:39:45.040 whom there was this one guy he's had00:39:47.720 diabetes his whole life he's like in his00:39:49.400 50s um on lots of medication and just00:39:53.079 thought he would lose a leg and lose his00:39:55.040 vision that's what happens when you have00:39:56.240 type two for a very long time00:39:58.079 and the thing is his doctors had never00:39:59.720 explained to him why he had diabetes00:40:01.720 they had just told him you know take00:40:02.880 this pill and I take this insulin and he00:40:05.520 read my book and he understood why he00:40:07.720 got diabetes in the first place and he00:40:10.480 did the hacks he was able to reverse his00:40:12.640 type two diabetes in one year all his00:40:15.000 doctors were like how did you do it you00:40:16.960 know doctors don't often have this kind00:40:18.599 of information and then he sent me a00:40:20.520 long message saying now I'll be able to00:40:22.280 see my grandkid wedding and I really00:40:23.920 thank you for that it's so cute you know00:40:27.000 we're all we're all stuck in this00:40:29.960 vicious cycle of having this toxic food00:40:32.079 around us that's making us sick but not00:40:34.800 understanding how to get out of it and00:40:36.760 everybody wants to be healthy that man00:40:39.359 he was eating stuff that he thought00:40:41.119 would be good for him he was eating like00:40:43.119 the low calorie rice cakes and the fruit00:40:46.079 smoothies and the lowfat yogurts and all00:40:48.599 these things trying to be healthier but00:40:51.280 if you don't have the right information00:40:52.680 you can't actually make a change what00:40:55.640 would you say to parents it's it's00:40:57.680 really interesting cuz I I've had the00:40:59.520 experience of watching a lot of early00:41:01.000 parents over the last couple of months00:41:02.680 and um they care so much about their00:41:06.240 kids just eating it something that often00:41:08.839 they'll give them something that is high00:41:10.319 in glucose does it matter you know00:41:13.200 because sometimes people look at kids00:41:14.240 and go well they're a kid they they'll00:41:16.000 kind of it won't have an impact on them00:41:18.160 they'll kind of grow out of it yeah well00:41:20.240 we'll make sure that they eat healthy00:41:21.400 later we just need to make sure they eat00:41:22.839 something now listen we used to think00:41:25.520 type two diabetes was a disease is00:41:27.480 reserved for adults and now 5-year-olds00:41:29.240 get it it's very important to help your00:41:31.560 kids eat well so that they set up their00:41:33.720 body in a healthy way one thing that I00:41:35.640 hear is yeah Jesse I know I should be00:41:37.400 giving my kids eggs in the morning but00:41:40.040 they just keep begging for the cereal00:41:41.640 and I just I can't say no you know they00:41:43.760 they won't they won't let go I have to00:41:45.760 give it to them and I say what if they00:41:47.640 were begging you for00:41:49.280 cigarettes would you give them the00:41:51.359 cigarettes like you don't actually have00:41:53.800 to give your kids this food it's hard00:41:56.960 for for sure but if it's a priority for00:41:59.319 you you can totally do it absolutely and00:42:01.960 I think it's important to set an example00:42:04.839 actually because if you're having cereal00:42:06.440 and orange juice it's going to be really00:42:07.720 hard for your kids to take you seriously00:42:09.400 like come on dad like you know shut up00:42:12.200 what you think of giving kids orange00:42:13.440 juice oh my God it's terrible it's the00:42:15.240 worst it's it's it's just terrible it's00:42:17.960 big rush of sugar can affect it can00:42:20.319 affect Behavior you know tantrums and00:42:23.160 the sugar cravings and the sugar lows I00:42:26.400 mean no it's terrible it breaks my heart00:42:28.880 I'm like wow those little bodies are not00:42:31.200 happy right now you know there's so many00:42:33.920 parents that are listening right now00:42:35.800 like you don't [ __ ] get it you too00:42:38.400 childless better totally and that's why00:42:40.599 Stephen you know when I have kids I00:42:42.280 totally want to write a book about that00:42:43.559 because I think there's lots of stuff we00:42:44.559 can teach a parents about how to feed00:42:47.040 their kids it's too easy for me to say00:42:49.079 this stuff I don't have kids I don't00:42:50.119 know how it is but I can tell you one00:42:51.559 thing there will be no orange juice in00:42:53.960 my house no orange juice like my mom my00:42:57.319 mom was addicted to diet coke when she00:42:58.839 was younger so we never had soda in our00:43:00.680 house never and I hate I hate soda now I00:43:03.359 would never be able to drink any of that00:43:05.240 stuff because it was never I never00:43:06.839 learned to like it so don't be scared00:43:09.040 that your kid is going to binge if you00:43:11.040 restrict all the sugary stuff I think00:43:12.559 it's the opposite I think if you don't00:43:13.920 give them the Habit they just won't have00:43:15.240 the habit I do agree we we um we didn't00:43:17.880 have many sweet things or fizzy drinks00:43:20.960 or anything in in the house and I think00:43:22.400 as a kid I was resentful because you00:43:24.359 you'd go to school and you'd see those00:43:25.640 things you you'd lean towards them and00:43:27.319 you'd love them at school but frankly as00:43:29.079 I've grown older I'm completely cool00:43:30.920 with just drinking water all the time00:43:33.200 that's part partly because that's what00:43:34.480 we had in the house so my relationship00:43:36.160 with water is pretty strong I feel you00:43:38.280 but you know one thing that parents do00:43:39.599 tell me is that when they do their00:43:40.680 glucose hacks and they manage their00:43:42.280 glucose levels they're able to be more00:43:43.960 Zen around their kids and sort of you00:43:46.079 know stay a bit more um centered when00:43:49.040 their kids are freaking out or asking00:43:50.520 about something a lot their their mood00:43:52.400 is steadier so they can actually make00:43:53.920 better choices for the whole family and00:43:55.280 they have a bit more stamina and uh then00:43:57.960 their kids do the hacks and their kids00:44:01.079 get calmer and then the family is just00:44:02.880 having a better time generally but it00:44:05.079 can really00:44:06.319 impact even a marriage this a great00:44:08.520 study I have to tell you about that was00:44:10.680 looking at married couples so they00:44:12.559 recruited 300 married couples and bless00:44:15.160 these scientists they're just insane so00:44:17.400 they recruited 300 married couples they00:44:20.000 gave each person in the marriage a00:44:22.640 voodoo doll representing their spouse so00:44:26.680 if you're in a marriage you have a00:44:27.880 voodoo doll representing your husband or00:44:29.400 your wife scientists then asked the00:44:32.400 people to put a pin in the voodo doll00:44:36.440 representing their spouse every time00:44:38.319 their spouse annoyed them for six weeks00:44:42.400 at the end of the study they took all00:44:43.839 the voodoo dolls counted the pins they00:44:45.839 also measured the participants glucose00:44:48.520 levels what they found Stephen is that00:44:51.960 those who had more variable glucose00:44:54.400 levels specifically those who had more00:44:56.160 low glucose level events which happens00:44:58.440 after spikes had put more pins in the00:45:02.520 voodoo doll representing their spouse so00:45:05.359 their glucose levels seem to be linked00:45:07.240 to how irritated they were with their00:45:09.079 partner and then the scientists00:45:10.880 speculated that this had to do with a00:45:13.000 neurotransmitter called tyrosine and the00:45:15.280 more glucose roller coaster you have00:45:17.119 going on the lower your tyrosine levels00:45:19.440 and tyrosine balances our mood so the00:45:22.599 food you eat can impact your marriage00:45:25.480 can impact how you show up00:45:27.640 with others can impact how you feel00:45:30.160 about other people's behavior it goes00:45:32.079 really deep it's not just about diabetes00:45:34.559 it it impacts who you are as a person00:45:36.559 your personality so if I stop eating00:45:38.680 sugar it will save my marriage I mean00:45:41.200 you said00:45:43.079 it it's not it's really interesting I00:45:45.040 was thinking as you were talking as well00:45:46.240 about how glucose is linked to our sort00:45:51.240 of discipline more broadly you know you00:45:53.839 were talking earlier about parents and00:45:55.559 them being able to be more sort of00:45:56.599 disciplined and strict with and calm00:46:00.119 when they themselves get their glucose00:46:02.000 under control but you think about all of00:46:03.359 our lives our lives are shaped by the00:46:04.760 habits that we perform consistently and00:46:06.680 for us to have good um habits that are00:46:10.000 prod conducive with our health our00:46:12.480 happiness our success then we need to be00:46:15.240 focused and disciplined and be able to00:46:17.000 reach for the right things um whether00:46:19.240 it's a dumbbell or whether it's our00:46:21.160 laptop yeah so like do do you ever think00:46:23.599 much about the role that glucose plays00:46:25.200 with our sort of discipline to be who we00:46:27.079 want to be to sh up how we want to sh up00:46:28.680 completely because so many people are00:46:30.520 stuck in a cycle of being a victim to00:46:33.079 their Cravings being a victim to their00:46:34.599 fatigue and they can't show up as the00:46:36.440 person they want to be and if you switch00:46:39.599 your diet and use these hacks you can00:46:42.079 actually be more connected to the00:46:44.079 version of yourself that you want to be00:46:45.920 and even just a simple thing like a00:46:47.200 Savory breakfast it can deeply change00:46:49.960 how you show up throughout your day00:46:52.280 instead of being exhausted at 11:00 a.m.00:46:55.160 needing four coffees feeling this00:46:56.920 lethargic in your work meeting then at 300:46:59.040 p.m. thinking oh I really want to have a00:47:00.640 nap I would have a nap on the floor00:47:02.000 right here if I could looking for sugar00:47:03.839 all the time you actually have a clearer00:47:05.680 brain like we know glucose spikes are00:47:07.440 linked to even just brain fog and brain00:47:09.680 fog is a debilitating symptom to have00:47:12.440 you can't show up as the person you want00:47:14.559 to be I would never be able to do the00:47:16.160 work that I do if I didn't have my00:47:17.960 glucose under control and I learned that00:47:19.800 from the very beginning that's why I got00:47:21.119 into this work in the first place but00:47:23.200 100% agree with you yeah so the first00:47:25.839 hack we talked about was the Savory00:47:27.839 breakfast there was the second one you00:47:29.040 talked about vinegar which we talked00:47:30.280 about last time which I remember I was00:47:31.440 really repulsed by but you count this as00:47:33.680 one of your most important hacks is to00:47:36.319 eat vinegar every day it's drink one00:47:38.480 tablespoon of vinegar in a big glass of00:47:40.319 water before your biggest meal of the00:47:42.440 day and the reason it's important00:47:43.599 Stephen is because it's easy and I'm all00:47:45.960 about easy hacks big bang for your bck00:47:48.720 so vinegar contains acetic acid which00:47:51.640 interacts with your digestive enzymes00:47:53.680 and cuts the glucose Spike of your meal00:47:55.440 by up to 30% with no effort so if you00:47:58.280 want a super low effort albeit not very00:48:01.040 delicious super low effort hack to try00:48:03.800 do that and see how you feel with a00:48:06.480 smaller Spike and a smaller crash few00:48:08.559 Cravings less fatigue what kind of00:48:10.440 vinegar any kind of vinegar it can be00:48:12.680 the vinegar you have at home literally00:48:14.079 tonight just grab the white vinegar in00:48:16.319 your kitchen and not the cleaning00:48:17.640 vinegar if it's next to the toilet paper00:48:19.079 it's not the right vinegar you want the00:48:20.800 kitchen vinegar one tablespoon in a big00:48:23.079 glass of water dilute it drink it 1000:48:25.079 minutes before having your dinner see00:48:26.440 how you feel what's what role is the00:48:28.079 water playing in this just dilution so00:48:30.520 that it doesn't hurt your teeth because00:48:32.280 your dentist won't be very happy if you00:48:34.240 take a shot of vinegar because it can00:48:35.520 hurt your teeth's enamel okay so that's00:48:38.240 hack number two and that's really to00:48:39.640 sort of line my stomach to so no that's00:48:42.800 to interact with your digestive enzymes00:48:44.960 the line stomach is the third hack which00:48:46.960 is Veggie starters so all around the00:48:49.640 world if you look at different cultures00:48:51.160 you see this habit this tradition of00:48:53.440 starting your meal with veggies in Italy00:48:56.160 aunti00:48:57.359 in France crud raw vegetables at the end00:49:00.359 of your at the beginning of your meal in00:49:02.200 the Middle East you start your meals00:49:04.119 with herbs by the bunch right why are we00:49:07.319 doing this veggies first thing well00:49:09.559 recently scientists have discovered why00:49:11.040 it's so powerful it's because veggies00:49:13.520 contain fiber we love fiber she's the00:49:16.760 best when you have fiber at the00:49:18.480 beginning of a meal what it does is that00:49:20.359 it coats your intestine it makes this00:49:22.440 sort of protective barrier this00:49:24.960 protective mesh kind of goo fibrous mesh00:49:28.720 and so any glucose you eat afterwards00:49:31.400 will not be able to go through your00:49:33.839 intestine into your bloodstream so00:49:35.680 quickly so it slows down the arrival of00:49:38.040 glucose into your blood and it slows00:49:40.079 down that Spike you can make the00:49:42.119 experiment if you're wearing a monitor00:49:44.359 just have a a small plate of you know00:49:47.240 carrots or spinach or broccoli or cherry00:49:49.280 tomatoes or whatever veggie you like00:49:51.160 before a meal and see how much smaller00:49:53.000 your glucose spike is you stay Fuller00:49:55.359 for longer have few crat and you're00:49:57.200 helping your body from within too and00:49:59.559 the fourth one you mentioned was moving00:50:01.440 after after eating yeah so after eating00:50:05.240 use your body and your muscles for 1000:50:07.200 minutes you can clean your apartment go00:50:10.319 for a walk with your dog dance to a few00:50:12.680 songs if you're at the office you can do00:50:15.240 calf raises under your desk like this so00:50:17.200 you just sort of push up onto the balls00:50:18.920 of your feet up and down for 10 minutes00:50:20.960 nobody will see and your calves contain00:50:23.559 a muscle called the Solus muscle which00:50:25.240 is really good at soaking up glucose but00:50:27.559 it's what we were talking about earlier00:50:28.839 Stephen your muscles are really00:50:31.000 effective glucose dumps and the more you00:50:33.119 use them to contract the more they're00:50:34.920 going to soak up glucose from your00:50:36.520 bloodstream to use for energy so that's00:50:39.400 the four hacks Savory breakfast vinegar00:50:42.119 once a day veggie starter once a day you00:50:44.319 can also combine those two and do like a00:50:46.599 vinegar dressing on a veggie starter and00:50:49.319 then moving after eating and then when00:50:51.200 you want to get Pro you go to all my00:50:52.480 other hacks people talk about being in a00:50:54.240 food comr after they've eaten yeah which00:50:56.640 which is I mean the antithesis of what00:50:58.040 you're you're saying absolutely food00:51:00.520 coma is like a combination of brain fog00:51:02.119 and fatigue right and what's going on00:51:04.200 there well I think there's a lot of00:51:06.000 things going on but one study that's00:51:07.520 really interesting shows us that in rats00:51:10.839 when you create lots of big glucose00:51:12.839 spikes and when you monitor the activity00:51:15.040 of their neurons in the rats scientists00:51:17.480 noticed that the more glucose spikes00:51:19.400 they had the slower the speed of the00:51:23.440 signal between their neurons so their00:51:25.799 brain was literally slowing down the00:51:28.960 information was going more slowly00:51:31.000 throughout the brain and they're the00:51:32.400 they theorized that in humans this could00:51:34.440 lead to brain fog so you have glucose00:51:36.799 spikes linked to brain fog and your00:51:39.079 mitochondria becoming exhausted from Big00:51:41.720 glucose spikes potentially making you00:51:43.839 really tired you know 90 minutes after00:51:45.640 eating with the hack food coma reduced00:51:49.079 significantly so you can actually do00:51:50.839 stuff after eating instead of just being00:51:53.119 lying down and not being able to get up00:51:55.960 and you took these hacks and you did an00:51:57.920 experiment right on page seven of your00:52:00.640 book the glucose goddess00:52:03.440 method you talk about this 2,700 person00:52:07.040 pilot experiment that you did in 201900:52:10.599 yeah which of the hacks did you use for00:52:13.000 this experiment and what did you find so00:52:15.040 it was these four hacks so it was a00:52:16.720 four-week experiment week one you start00:52:19.480 your Savory breakfast every day you do00:52:21.559 that for the four weeks week two you add00:52:24.160 in vinegar once a day you continue for00:52:26.520 for the rest of the three weeks week00:52:28.240 three you add veggie starters and week00:52:30.079 four you add moving after eating you00:52:33.040 don't have to change anything else about00:52:34.799 what you're eating I'm not cutting out00:52:36.599 sugar I'm not telling you to not drink00:52:38.280 alcohol I'm not telling you to not drink00:52:39.559 pasta I'm just asking you to add these00:52:42.200 for hacks in and see what happens and00:52:45.440 these people were from 110 countries00:52:47.559 yeah I recruited I recruited them online00:52:49.760 on through Instagram between the ages of00:52:51.799 20 and 70 years old mhm and what00:52:55.160 happened listen the results were really00:52:57.520 stunning so 90% of people reduced their00:52:59.799 Cravings 90% of people had more energy00:53:02.160 you had really significant impacts on00:53:04.040 sleep on hormones on skin on mood on00:53:08.400 Diabetes I mean of course this is not a00:53:11.119 you know Placebo controlled randomized00:53:13.200 trial it's just an experiment I didn't00:53:15.079 have a control group but these numbers00:53:17.400 are pretty remarkable and that's what I00:53:19.359 see when I meet people when I see the00:53:21.400 testimonials from my readers so just00:53:23.520 very quick impact because glucose spikes00:53:26.240 imp act all parts of our system physical00:53:29.799 and mental and when you balance them00:53:31.400 Stephen you're creating a much better00:53:33.559 foundation for your body and your mind00:53:36.079 to be healthy and these are00:53:37.640 self-reported symptoms right totally00:53:39.240 yeah so we did a survey at the end of00:53:41.240 every of the four weeks and uh just00:53:43.599 measured the results and when you say00:53:46.200 there's no control group that means that00:53:48.440 there wasn't another group who weren't00:53:50.960 who were doing like a different kind of00:53:52.760 intervention or Placebo no okay so it00:53:54.960 was just 3,000 people doing the hacks00:53:57.240 and I was just asking them questions uh00:53:59.680 at the end and it says here 40% roughly00:54:02.000 40% of people who wanted to lose weight00:54:03.680 did in fact lose weight in those four00:54:05.040 weeks yeah with no calorie restriction00:54:07.680 no request to eat less and the reason00:54:11.400 this is interesting is that even though00:54:13.200 weight loss is not the primary objective00:54:15.359 of balancing your glucose levels what00:54:17.400 happens when you reduce your spikes is00:54:19.799 that you reduce Cravings because you're00:54:21.760 not activating that craving Center00:54:23.319 anymore you reduce hunger you have more00:54:25.799 energy to potentially move more and you00:54:28.839 lower your insulin levels now this is00:54:30.920 very important because when there's00:54:32.480 insulin present in your body you cannot00:54:34.799 burn fat insulin is storing fat and00:54:38.240 making more fat and when you lower00:54:40.520 insulin you can actually burn some of00:54:42.760 the fat that you stored and there's00:54:44.799 going to be people screaming because00:54:45.799 they want to know the other sort of six00:54:47.680 this 10 right yeah I can go through all00:54:49.400 of them if you want sit the other six AR00:54:51.839 of course of course of course so another00:54:54.359 hack is eating your food in the right00:54:56.799 now this is kind of similar to the00:54:58.440 veggie starter it's just a bit more00:55:00.280 complicated and it's really where the00:55:02.119 science it's really what the science00:55:03.960 shows us the science shows us that if00:55:06.400 you eat a meal in the right order00:55:08.280 meaning veggies first then proteins and00:55:11.559 fats then starches and sugars instead of00:55:14.480 the opposite you reduce the glucose00:55:16.400 Spike of the meal by up to00:55:18.559 75% you're eating the same meal the same00:55:22.440 quantity the same food just the order00:55:24.480 and using that fiber first mentality00:55:26.920 is going to reduce your Spike00:55:28.559 significantly just to be clear this00:55:29.680 doesn't mean that I'm going to gain less00:55:31.799 weight from that00:55:33.520 meal well no because it doesn't H you00:55:36.039 know weight loss doesn't happen within00:55:37.559 one specific meal but it does mean00:55:39.359 you'll have fewer Cravings a couple00:55:41.079 hours after that meal so maybe you won't00:55:42.680 reach for the donut okay that's how it00:55:44.680 would work so indirectly I might not00:55:46.520 game more away exactly exactly so eating00:55:49.520 your food in the right order okay having00:55:51.880 a Savory breakfast we talked about it00:55:54.000 veggies first we talked about it vinegar00:55:56.520 we talked about it moving after eating00:55:57.799 we talked about it and then there's00:55:58.920 clothes on00:56:00.119 carbs so that means anytime you eat00:56:03.119 starches or sugars which are the big00:56:05.280 category of carbs make sure you're never00:56:07.280 eating them naked or on their own00:56:10.960 because if you eat them on their own00:56:13.400 plof they just turn into glucose really00:56:15.200 really quickly so instead of having a00:56:16.480 slice of bread on its own have bread and00:56:19.039 some avocado add some fat to that that's00:56:21.640 a good clothing to add or add some00:56:23.440 protein or add some Fiber if you're00:56:25.119 having a carrot cake don't have it on00:56:27.280 its own have it with a Greek yogurt for00:56:29.480 example so that's clothes on carbs it's00:56:33.839 really easy to remember especially if00:56:36.599 you're going throughout your day and you00:56:37.839 can't really pick what you're eating00:56:39.440 because you don't have many options just00:56:40.760 think clothes on carbs then we have00:56:43.119 Savory00:56:44.240 snacks so during a day if you want to00:56:46.920 have a snack between meals when your00:56:49.039 stomach is empty try to have something00:56:51.280 Savory that won't increase your glucose00:56:53.440 spikes instead of having something sweet00:56:56.760 then another hack that we kind of00:56:57.920 touched on is if you want to eat00:57:00.119 something sweet have it as dessert00:57:02.400 instead of on an empty stomach so if I00:57:04.359 want a cookie or a carrot cake I will00:57:06.319 make sure to buy it in the morning if I00:57:07.880 know where I want to get it from and00:57:08.960 then have it as dessert after my lunch00:57:10.839 or after my dinner so I'm not removing00:57:13.880 any of the sugar from your life I'm just00:57:15.960 showing you how and when to eat it so it00:57:18.720 will reduce the glucose Spike and then00:57:21.000 we have always eat your fruit whole00:57:23.720 never Juiced never dried never smoothed00:57:26.920 only whole to have that protective fiber00:57:29.200 in there thinking about your Instagram00:57:32.079 you post these photos of glucose spikes00:57:33.920 with um in response to different foods00:57:35.920 how do you trial that is that oh great00:57:38.319 question are those your spikes yeah00:57:40.039 those are my spikes or the spikes from00:57:41.480 somebody on my team but it's really00:57:42.799 important to note that these spikes are00:57:46.119 just00:57:46.920 illustrating studies trials that have00:57:49.520 been done by scientists around the world00:57:51.000 so for example I'll find a clinical00:57:52.960 trial showing that vinegar before a meal00:57:55.079 reduces a glucose Spike it's been shown00:57:57.039 at scale with a placebo you know proper00:57:59.799 clinical study and I'll just make an00:58:02.000 example with my own data to illustrate00:58:04.799 that scientific study and that's why if00:58:06.599 you swipe on my post you'll see my graph00:58:08.799 and then the study that I mentioned or00:58:10.200 in the description of the post I don't00:58:12.280 draw any conclusions from my own glucose00:58:14.400 data I'm not like oh look today I had a00:58:16.880 green tea and that didn't cause a spike00:58:18.359 and yesterday I had a green tea and I00:58:19.760 also had a piece of I don't know00:58:21.119 whatever an almond and that caused a00:58:23.160 biggest [ __ ] so I should be telling00:58:25.160 everybody to not have elments like00:58:26.640 that's not how it works at all it's just00:58:28.720 an illustration of existing studies00:58:30.960 that's my role that's my job that's what00:58:32.319 I love to do to translate studies that00:58:34.440 are existing in a way that makes it00:58:37.440 easier for people to understand because00:58:39.240 you can't just give somebody a00:58:41.400 scientific paper you have to explain it00:58:44.039 in a visual way that they can00:58:45.839 immediately get it so of those visuals00:58:49.200 that you've made is there some in00:58:52.280 particular that were most surprising to00:58:53.920 you or most shocking to you because I'm00:58:55.200 going to put some of them on the screen00:58:56.720 so some of them that come to mind that00:58:58.280 would maybe had the biggest response00:59:01.000 from your audience for example yeah I00:59:03.480 think some of the ones that show00:59:04.960 traditional food combinations and how00:59:06.559 they're actually good for our glucose00:59:07.760 levels are fascinating for example00:59:09.720 grapes and cheese so I'm French and00:59:12.400 often when you eat like a big uh plateau00:59:15.119 of cheese you'll have some grapes there00:59:16.559 to have with and it you know the glucose00:59:19.039 response shows us that if we had the00:59:20.359 grape on its own it would be a bigger00:59:22.280 Spike than the grape with the cheese not00:59:24.319 only is it really delicious it's Al00:59:26.280 better for your glucose levels because00:59:27.480 you're putting clothing on that sugary00:59:29.799 carb that is the piece of fruit or ham00:59:33.880 and melon or rice and beans all these00:59:37.359 traditional combinations cause smaller00:59:40.039 spikes than you would expect from the00:59:41.799 individual ingredients that's really00:59:43.920 quite fascinating in terms of the most00:59:46.400 um shocking ones I think00:59:48.760 any glucose graph showing food order is00:59:52.559 really interesting so for example if you00:59:54.280 have salad and then then pasta which is00:59:57.640 much better for your glucose levels than00:59:59.359 having pasta and then the salad01:00:01.880 interesting yeah and that's the food01:00:03.240 order hack going on do you know off the01:00:06.440 top of your head what your most engaged01:00:08.960 post has been of all time the one that's01:00:10.920 been shared the most or commented on the01:00:12.359 most um actually it's one currently at01:00:15.640 least on YouTube it's one where I01:00:17.280 explain where I show an image of an01:00:19.440 ancestral banana what bananas used to01:00:21.960 actually look like in nature and what01:00:24.319 bananas look like today to illustrate01:00:26.000 that the fruit that you find today in01:00:27.160 the supermarket is not natural so that's01:00:30.160 a very very popular one and then I think01:00:32.280 it's the hacks um it's the glucose01:00:34.960 graphs and the videos where I explain01:00:36.280 food order people really love that it's01:00:38.480 so interesting to see that if you have01:00:41.839 your veggies at the beginning of a meal01:00:43.559 you have such a big impact on your01:00:45.520 glucose levels whereas we've all been01:00:47.160 taught that all your food mixes in your01:00:49.319 stomach and mixes like big smoothie and01:00:51.039 it doesn't matter well it does01:00:53.359 actually yeah that because that's really01:00:56.000 easy to change as well totally you don't01:00:57.799 have to change what you're eating how01:00:59.799 much you're eating just next time you're01:01:02.000 sat at a meal think oh I'm going to have01:01:04.280 the veggies on my plate first that's it01:01:07.559 so powerful these hacks are so easy01:01:10.640 Stephen I really want everybody to know01:01:12.160 them I want to become irrelevant I don't01:01:13.880 want to have any more work because01:01:15.359 everybody knows these hacks it's so01:01:17.200 important for our Public Health I think01:01:19.599 some uh vinegar has arrived for you to01:01:21.280 shot yeah no we can't shot it Stephen we01:01:23.559 have to dilute it I'm I'll dilute it as01:01:25.599 well let01:01:28.680 for yes so this is side of vinegar but01:01:32.160 any vinegar works you don't have to buy01:01:33.680 expensive vinegar it doesn't have to be01:01:35.240 organic unfiltered whatever just kitchen01:01:37.359 vinegar works no I try it straight I've01:01:40.119 actually never really drink okay but if01:01:41.599 you're dentist is upset it's not my01:01:42.839 fault okay01:01:45.920 well so Jesse told me to drink this01:01:48.839 straight no she's an expert she said01:01:51.200 she's a scientist01:01:57.599 oh01:01:59.880 gosh yeah you're not supposed to do that01:02:01.960 Stephen no I'm01:02:03.359 sorry no it's been really lovely getting01:02:05.599 to imagine if but it's not that bad but01:02:09.520 it's not something that I would do for01:02:11.079 fun yeah but also if you want to have01:02:12.760 vinegar straight you need to get higher01:02:14.160 quality vinegar there's some vinegars01:02:15.640 that taste really really good but in our01:02:17.799 case we're just trying to get the acetic01:02:19.559 acid and we don't need high quality01:02:21.039 expensive vinegar we can just do like01:02:22.400 really cheap01:02:23.359 vinegar and this is a we just put one01:02:25.480 tbspoon this is a good hack if you have01:02:27.240 a parent that has diabetes and they01:02:29.200 don't want to change anything about01:02:30.319 their lifestyle just get them to add01:02:32.160 this before their meals when they're01:02:33.160 eating carbs and you'll see a good01:02:34.319 impact on their glucos levels okay so01:02:36.119 I'm mixing it like this you didn't put01:02:37.880 much in there I put a tablespoon it's a01:02:41.839 tablespoon and even that small amount01:02:44.119 you L it looked like you you kind of01:02:45.520 filled the lid I fill the lid twice01:02:47.279 basically which is approximately one01:02:49.400 tablespoon I think cuz this is probably01:02:51.880 like yeah this is half a tablespoon I01:02:54.920 would say okay I've done this01:02:56.799 before and now you can't taste01:03:01.119 anything you're telling me that that01:03:03.039 will have an impact absolutely and the01:03:04.520 studies prove it I can't taste anything01:03:06.799 yeah maybe because I just had the big01:03:08.160 shot I think that's probably why but but01:03:11.400 totally Stephen I even meet people on01:03:13.520 the street or like my readers and stuff01:03:15.079 and they'll show me that in their purse01:03:16.440 they have a little um bottle of vinegar01:03:18.640 they take with them it's super easy and01:03:21.000 you know I was very skeptical and I01:03:22.279 think everybody was super skeptical01:03:23.680 about the vinegar thing until the01:03:25.799 studies were widely read it's it's an01:03:28.680 amazing ingredient that's been used for01:03:31.079 Millennia for its health benefits but01:03:33.279 now we understand how it works it has01:03:35.119 impact on visceral fat on cholesterol01:03:37.359 levels on glucose and on insulin levels01:03:39.319 it's a magical ingredient it's super01:03:41.039 cheap so have some vinegar but be very01:03:43.640 careful now a lot of big brands are01:03:45.559 jumping on this and are making vinegar01:03:47.039 drinks that have sugar in them so you01:03:48.960 want straight vinegar you don't want01:03:50.319 anything that has even a tiny bit of01:03:51.920 apple juice or sugar uhuhuh straight01:03:54.359 vinegar01:03:56.319 you said visceral fat yeah is that belly01:03:58.319 fat yeah it's the fat between your01:04:00.000 organs it's the fat that's really bad01:04:02.079 for you so you can have fat that is sort01:04:04.680 of on the outside of your body and you01:04:06.160 can you can grab it you know you can01:04:08.319 grab it and you can really pinch it01:04:09.920 speak for yourself no I totally have01:04:12.160 nice fat here that I can grab yeah yeah01:04:14.279 so this fat you know I can grab visceral01:04:17.160 fat is underneath my muscle layer and01:04:20.160 you would know if somebody has visceral01:04:21.799 fat if they have kind of a big hard01:04:24.200 belly have you ever seen that and they01:04:26.480 just kind of but if you touch it you01:04:28.039 can't make it into a roll that's01:04:30.039 visceral fat that's between your organs01:04:31.400 and that's really bad for you so vinegar01:04:33.000 helps of course this is not a magic01:04:35.079 solution that's going to fix all your01:04:36.960 issues and you know prevent ton of01:04:39.160 diseases it's a good Ally to have and01:04:41.720 I'm all about little allies you bring01:04:43.920 with you Gentle Giants you have01:04:45.440 throughout your day that are going to01:04:46.720 help you get to Health in an easy01:04:48.319 manageable way so so if I have that01:04:51.079 glass that you've just made for me which01:04:52.640 basically I can't taste the vinegar in01:04:54.160 because it's been dilated by water and01:04:56.400 then I eat something yeah remind me01:04:58.559 again of the impact that that will have01:04:59.760 on my glucose Spike so it'll reduce your01:05:03.079 glucose Spike by up to 30% and your01:05:05.359 insulin Spike also by up to 30% the way01:05:08.240 it works is that you have these little01:05:11.400 scissors in your stomach like miniature01:05:15.359 scissors called enzymes their job is to01:05:18.440 chop up the starches and sugars and turn01:05:20.920 them into individual glucose molecules01:05:22.920 it's a part of your digestive process01:05:24.960 these enzymes01:05:26.200 do this01:05:27.799 job vinegar will temporarily inactivate01:05:31.880 some of those little scissors01:05:33.119 essentially slowing down how quickly the01:05:36.039 glucose arrives into your bloodstream01:05:38.520 it's all about velocity we're all about01:05:41.200 trying to reduce the speed of arrival of01:05:43.920 glucose into your bloodstream that's the01:05:46.440 key so vinegar is a really effective way01:05:48.880 of doing this one of the things that I01:05:51.160 read online as well about glucose and01:05:52.839 again this is like conspiracy theories01:05:55.079 that are01:05:56.480 I read this is a variation of the Tweet01:05:59.279 um I'll read it out it says sugar in a01:06:02.520 baby's brain is called ADHD sugar in01:06:06.279 adult's brain is called dementia and01:06:07.960 Alzheimer's sugar in your eyes is called01:06:10.720 glycom sugar in your teeth is called01:06:13.000 cavities sugar on your skin is called01:06:15.240 Aging sugar in your sleep is called01:06:17.720 insomnia sugar in your blood is called01:06:20.799 diabetes sugar on Wall Street is called01:06:24.000 a billion dollar industry boom I get the01:06:27.480 point I think sugar is definitely one of01:06:30.000 the main drivers of all these things but01:06:32.520 there's other stuff going on of course01:06:33.839 but I like that I think the Alzheimer's01:06:35.440 one is really interesting to talk01:06:37.760 about there's a study that has followed01:06:40.880 people for 30 years and they found that01:06:45.240 people who had elevated glucose levels01:06:47.599 in their 40s were more likely to get01:06:50.920 Alzheimer's when they reach 60 70 80 so01:06:55.720 having high glucose levels at midlife is01:06:57.680 a risk factor for Alzheimer's when01:06:59.880 you're older not only that but01:07:01.960 scientists have started to see that some01:07:03.480 of the things you see in the brain of01:07:05.760 someone with Alzheimer's are actually01:07:07.520 similar to what you see in the body of01:07:10.240 somebody with diabetes namely01:07:13.359 inflammation glycation and insulin01:07:17.400 resistance so much so that some01:07:19.960 scientists call Alzheimer's type 301:07:23.960 diabetes diabetes of the01:07:26.720 brain pretty freaking fascinating01:07:30.279 there's going to be so many people that01:07:31.760 are listening to our conversation when01:07:33.279 we talked about PCOS or Alzheimer's or01:07:36.200 all these kinds of things I think like01:07:38.480 how how is it fair that I've got these01:07:41.119 conditions when I don't even eat as much01:07:43.279 sugar as most people yeah you know they01:07:45.720 probably look at someone who is really01:07:47.799 binging out on sugar who doesn't have01:07:50.119 any of these things if I was a woman and01:07:51.839 I had PCOS and I ate just a little bit01:07:55.960 of sugar I'd be like this is not fair01:07:58.079 and a second ago when you said at 40 if01:07:59.640 you have elevated gluc glucose levels is01:08:03.079 that relative to like or is that to your01:08:06.920 response no they're looking at fasting01:08:09.240 glucose so a measure of a how diabetic01:08:11.839 you are essentially if you're healthy01:08:13.760 pre-diabetic or diabetic so it's not01:08:15.359 looking at the spikes it's looking at01:08:17.238 your Baseline in the morning which is01:08:18.799 what doctors measure with a blood test01:08:21.120 oh okay yeah yeah but Stephen life is01:08:23.960 unfair like I01:08:26.120 my glucose spikes led to terrible mental01:08:29.560 health episodes of depersonalization01:08:31.839 lots of people I know eat so much sugar01:08:33.759 all the time have never had one mental01:08:35.238 health issue in their life I like I01:08:37.439 don't have all the answers to that we01:08:39.120 just know that on average if you look at01:08:41.158 everybody by reducing those spikes01:08:42.960 you're going to reduce the likelihood of01:08:44.759 these diseases but you see people who01:08:46.439 like smoke two packs of cigarettes a day01:08:48.759 drink two liters of orange juice and01:08:50.399 live to 120 with no health issues and01:08:52.719 you have people who are perfectly01:08:54.120 healthy who get cancer at 25 and die01:08:56.640 like I'm not God I don't know but what I01:08:59.600 do know is that in a lot of cases when01:09:02.120 you have a condition that's linked to01:09:03.399 glucose levels and you apply these hacks01:09:05.238 you can get relief or remission that's01:09:07.198 all I know are there any societies where01:09:09.359 they just don't really eat sugar that01:09:11.640 you you can think of or any sort of I01:09:14.640 think any any culture any country that's01:09:16.880 been globalized and now has access to01:09:18.600 like fizzy drinks and stuff it's so01:09:19.960 addictive that stuff as soon as you01:09:21.479 introduce it somewhere everybody starts01:09:22.960 drinking it I'd love to do a continuous01:09:25.520 glucose monitor on like the heads a01:09:26.880 tribe or something in Africa and see01:09:28.839 amazing if they're like inflammation01:09:30.839 levels and stuff yeah I would do01:09:32.399 continous glucose monitor but also01:09:33.880 fasting glucose levels right to just01:09:35.640 kind of see what their Baseline is at do01:09:37.520 any of them have diabetes pre-diabetes01:09:39.799 or not at all what's going on but yeah I01:09:41.560 agree it's fascinating you mentioned a01:09:43.319 term earlier that I've only ever heard01:09:44.600 used when talking about a zmek glp1 yeah01:09:48.439 what what relationship does glucose have01:09:50.198 with gp1s and what the hell is a01:09:53.120 glp1 it's so interesting so01:09:55.960 in your digestive system you have these01:09:57.520 little cells they're called L cells and01:10:00.120 they're like little sensors and they01:10:01.960 just hang out there in your digestive01:10:03.520 tract just like chilling and doing01:10:05.040 nothing and then as soon as you eat and01:10:07.640 they sense food they wake up they're01:10:10.159 like alert we have a job to do and their01:10:12.960 job is to release a substance called01:10:16.920 glp1 this01:10:18.960 substance then goes to different parts01:10:21.120 of your body and tells you that you've01:10:22.840 eaten enough food and you can stop01:10:24.480 eating so for example you're having a01:10:26.440 big plate of01:10:27.640 pasta the starch goes into your01:10:30.239 digestive system the little L cells01:10:32.239 sense the pasta they're like oh we've01:10:33.800 eaten food and then it tells your brain01:10:35.880 Stephen you can stop eating you don't01:10:37.280 have to eat another five pounds of pasta01:10:39.280 you're satiated M and you become less01:10:41.560 hungry not only that but glp1 also helps01:10:45.360 your body deal with that glucose spike01:10:47.679 it says alert glucose is here let's put01:10:50.320 some of that glucose away into liver01:10:53.120 muscle and fat cells so glp101:10:55.800 is a totally normal part of our01:10:58.679 physiology it's been there forever we01:11:00.560 all have it but recently it's been kind01:11:03.600 of01:11:05.719 um just taking advantage of so there01:11:08.199 were scientists and Pharma companies who01:11:09.920 said hey this gp1 thing is pretty cool01:11:13.480 what happens if we give somebody 1001:11:16.880 times 20 times a 100 times more glp101:11:19.199 than they naturally have what what's01:11:21.159 going to happen Let's test that so they01:11:23.400 did that and what happened was people's01:11:25.600 glucose levels started decreasing a lot01:11:27.800 because remember gp1 puts glucose away01:11:31.239 second impact people stopped01:11:35.360 eathing they were not hungry anymore01:11:38.159 they appetite Zapped gel1 is a very01:11:41.600 powerful appetite suppressant especially01:11:43.440 wh"
