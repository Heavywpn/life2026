    I designed this Life OS system to separate Notes and Ideas () from Knowledge & Clippings ()
    
    _In a previous version of this template they were the same database filtered by a Tag - but I just wished they were separate in the end._
    
    - Use the Notebooks for ideas, meeting notes, reflections, planning, etc. - and link them to projects
    - Use the [[Knowledge Base 2]] to manage Clippings, Quotes, references - you can link these to your personal notebooks and notes using relations, and even used ‘/ Synced Block’ To sync quotes from one page to another to create truly powerful connections.
    - Also note that there is a prompted for regular personal reflection: think of it as your personal diary, rather than your work notebook!
    
    Here’s an overview of how the Notebooks work.
    
    - **Adding New Notes**
        1. You can add notes to the Notebook system either by using the inbox at the top of the dashboard: it is all served by the
            - Notes are Sub-items, Notebooks are Parent Items.
            - On the [[Notebooks 2]] page and homepage, Notes disappear from the Notes Inbox when **added to a Notebook other than [[Theatre Project Ideas 2]]** The Inbox is filtered where a note doesn’t have notebook or it’s notebook is quick notes: so to clear it and organise it into the database - just add it to a new notebook!
            - Use the database templates and Quick Action Buttons to Create New Notebooks, a New Quick Note, or A New Notebook and Note set. Just like tasks.
            - You can link notes to other databases and you’ll see them appear in filtered views for things like Projects, Contact or Creative OS Projects if you have that.
    - **Sorting & Viewing Notes**
        - Labelling a Note in the Status column as 'Live' means it will show in the Live Notes views.
        - Labelling a Note 'Archived' will mean it is only viewable in the Archive Section of the [[P.A.R.A Dashboard 2]] - like all other databases. toggles under the All Notes view.
        - Labelling a Note 'Priority' will keep it in the priority view on the [[Notebooks 2]] dashboard.
        - The Live Notes dashboard view is sorted by last edited.
        - The Notebooks on the right of the dashboard in desktop view are filtered by two views: Last Edited / Live, and All Notes.
        - Use the Subject Headings to be able to tag work and find related content with filters and searches!
