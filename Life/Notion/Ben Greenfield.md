Ben Greenfield: Guilty as charged.  **0:11**So how do you think about the  information overload solution then? Caleb Applegate: I think this is like a really good   lead in to talk about the advent of what you and I  have been kind of concocting, creating, building,  **0:24**crafting in the background to solve these  types of problems for everyday folks like us.**0:32**Ben Greenfield: I am super excited about  **0:44**today's show because I get to interview  my best friend. And even though you   might be wondering why the heck I'd just be  interviewing one of my pals on the podcast,  **0:53**it goes way beyond that. So if you listen to  my show, if you read my articles on my website,  **1:00**follow me on social media, or digest anything from  Ben Greenfield Life, the man at the helm of the  **1:08**amazing team working at Ben Greenfield Life.  And the president of the company is my guest  **1:14**on today's show, Caleb Applegate. Caleb, he'll  share with you his deep history and an impressive  **1:24**career leading up to, coming up to Ben Greenfield  Life. But I thought, gosh, there's so much that  **1:30**you guys get that is produced in the secret Batman  labs up here in the inland northwest that I gotta  **1:38**get the man behind the scenes on the show because  he's a wealth of knowledge, not just in business,  **1:44**but he's also tuned into the health, the  biohacking, the fitness world and beyond.**1:50**Ben Greenfield: And you're actually gonna start seeing Caleb   more and more places, too. For example, he'll  be presenting at the Health Optimization Summit  **1:56**coming up in London. Although this podcast might  be coming out after that show, you're going to see  **2:01**him a lot more popping up with some new projects  that we have going at Ben Greenfield Life as well.  **2:07**So I thought, what the heck, Caleb? I might as  well have you on the show. What do you think? Caleb Applegate: Ben, thanks for  **2:12**having me, man. Pleasure to be here. Ben Greenfield: Yeah. And you have   a pretty funny story that you tell.  I think you tell it better than me  **2:20**about how we actually connected up here in  Spokane. It involves me dirty and barefoot.**2:29**Caleb Applegate: It does involve you   dirty and barefoot, dialed in, zoned in on  one of your walking calls outside. But yeah,  **2:37**you're right. It's funny. This was right during  the middle, or actually at the beginning of  **2:43**COVID. We were looking for land. We have three  kids. My wife and I decided, hey, this is a good  **2:50**time to go get on a piece of property. And  so we actually were able to get something.**2:57**Caleb Applegate: Turns out, what, ten minutes from your old place,   North Spokane. And literally, the day that  we're moving, we're driving down the road,  **3:06**and I see this guy, barefoot, shirtless, walking  down the road, like, in the zone as you're   walking. And I'm like, wait a minute, I know this  guy. Turns out I didn't have your number anymore  **3:18**because we had met years before, through your mom,  actually, and I had to message you on Facebook,  **3:26**dude, I think we just moved ten minutes from  where you're at. We should get together. And   that kind of began the next season of our  families getting together quite often.**3:37**Ben Greenfield: Yeah. And at the time, you weren't, at least   to my recollection, you were super tuned into  the health and biohacking world at that point.**3:50**Caleb Applegate: No. That may be an understatement. No. In fact,   I would ping you all the time, if you recall, hey,  what do you think about this? Or, hey, I'm feeling  **4:00**a certain way, and you would always send me,  because you've probably written about literally  **4:06**everything. You have, the Bible. With Boundless,  it's easy for you to just like, hey, check out  **4:12**this article, or, I just did this podcast, or  you'd really get a lot of information extracted  **4:17**out of this new thing we just put out. And so  it was like you were the information repository,  **4:24**and I was like, holy smokes, this guy is dialed  in. I have to just have to keep asking questions.**4:30**Caleb Applegate: So I was probably that,   at least at first, that annoying  guy that kept pinging you.**4:36**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, it kind of went both ways, though,   because you were, like, the expert on business  building, the metaverse, information technology,  **4:45**crypto, all these things I didn't know much  about. I think that would actually be interesting   for people. Before we talk about the direction  that you've taken with health and fitness and  **4:55**what your routines and rituals are looking like  now. Where'd you actually come from before that? Caleb Applegate: Right, yeah, no, it's a great  **5:01**question. In fact, a pastor friend of ours likes  to say, God draws straight with crooked lines, and  **5:08**I'm definitely that crooked line story. And so,  yeah, years ago, I started in the entertainment  **5:15**space. I was blessed enough to have my first film  produced by Leonardo DiCaprio's company, Appian  **5:23**Way. And so that was kind of the first push into  the film industry, into the entertainment space,  **5:30**and it was an amazing experience, once in a  lifetime opportunity. I was able to take my  **5:35**family, but we made the decision at that  point that we didn't want to live in LA  **5:41**and raise our kids in LA. And so we landed  in Moscow, Idaho, where I would eventually  **5:48**meet you and other really great friends.  And we fell in love with the community.**5:54**Caleb Applegate: And we knew because we were making   that choice, the entertainment industry might  not be as accessible. I would have to travel a  **6:01**lot. And so we looked at alternative opportunities  on more of a local level. And it was through that  **6:09**that I opened a restaurant. And Moscow was  able to experiment with a few startups, but  **6:15**ultimately started offering consulting services.  And it wasn't that I put myself out there as the  **6:22**people would ask me advice on things, or, hey,  would you be willing to step in and help with  **6:30**this particular project? And one of  those projects, as it turns out, was a   Minecraft gaming server that needed some business  development executive help. And so I was able to,  **6:42**kind of the TLDR version of that was, I'm  not a gamer at all, but I did love business,  **6:50**and so was able to make the connection  with Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks,  **6:57**and envision and dream the American  Airlines center arena inside of Minecraft.  **7:04**And so ultimately this got the attention of  Microsoft and Mojang, all things considered.**7:10**Caleb Applegate: Long story short,   our server, Mineplex, was one of three that  helped pioneer the Minecraft marketplace that  **7:17**we know today. And we were super early, but  helped kind of build that all out. So it was  **7:23**an amazing experience. Then you mentioned  metaverse. This is where things get even  **7:29**more just funny and odd. It was through the  gaming ecosystem, we were using this gaming  **7:41**community connector. It was called Enjin.  This was pre-NFTs, pre-Enjin Coin ICO.**7:52**Caleb Applegate: We were using the   Enjin client. And so through that process  of getting to know the team over there,  **8:00**we started working together. And so they  brought me on as an advisor. And then  **8:05**after a good amount of time of helping  them kind of see things a bit different,  **8:11**they asked if I would come on board as a COO. So  I ran Enjin, which was then a top 50 blockchain  **8:17**company for four years. Had a blast, have huge  respect for those guys. Was able to co-found a  **8:24**token over there called EFI on Polkadot. And so,  yeah, became it was just all things blockchain.**8:31**Caleb Applegate: Taking what I've learned   from gamification, but really digging into the  software stack of things and understanding how  **8:39**information moves. Consequently, or I should  say, incidentally, Enjin pioneered the whole  **8:47**concept of a non-fungible token. This was  early days, 2017, right alongside cryptopunks,  **8:55**Witek Radomski, the CTO and co-founder of  Enjin, pioneered ERC 1155 standard and had  **9:04**envisioned this whole, what we coined a  multiverse where a game could mint items,  **9:12**melt them and remint them in another game. In  fact, it was a non-fungible token that actually  **9:19**had value in an ecosystem of interoperability. So  that's the whole metaverse Web3 NFT intersection.**9:30**Ben Greenfield: So my very rudimentary understanding   of that would be like the ninja sort of power  that I acquired in one game could actually  **9:36**have some type of value and be traded across  a different platform or something like that?**9:42**Caleb Applegate: Yep, absolutely. Absolutely. And Vtech had   such an incredible pioneering vision for this. I  mean, the stuff that Enjin did and has been doing  **9:53**still is just incredible, cutting edge. Again,  I have nothing but huge respect for those guys.**9:59**Ben Greenfield: Well, you've come a long way, baby,   because now you and I have conversations about the  EMF and blue light levels of VR headsets and how  **10:10**they could be heating and destroying tissue in the  brain. And so you've pivoted a little bit, man.**10:15**Caleb Applegate: I have pivoted a little bit. Look,   so blockchain has been a blast. I still kind  of dabble. And I sit on a board of a company  **10:25**called Passage that previously I was the  CEO of and another just incredible team.  **10:33**I love it. I think the principles behind  blockchain, governance, participation,  **10:41**bringing community together. An infinite ledger  of transaction history, immutability, trustless.  **10:48**I think so many principles that are embedded  in the DNA of blockchain, I just naturally  **10:56**gravitate towards. It's easy for me to talk  about what is money, who assigns it its value.**11:02**Caleb Applegate: The advent of bitcoin   introduced all sorts of, I think, very  critical, very compelling narratives,  **11:10**and we should be asking these questions. However,  you and I got together and started just talking  **11:17**about the world of health and wellness. And  this was really my own journey of having   some health issues and admittedly being a  little bit, just a little bit overweight.**11:28**Ben Greenfield: But you had an excuse for the   sector that you were working in. I mean, it's kind  of funny because, not to distract us too much,  **11:36**but River and Terran, my sons and I are headed  over to America's biggest gaming convention called  **11:42**Gen Con because my sons have started this card  game and board game business. And we were watching  **11:48**the instructional video for registration and  kind of like looking at videos of previous year's  **11:56**conferences and I warned them, I'm like, guys,  this is not going to be a fitness convention,   right? And not the stereotype. I'm going to offend  a lot of gamers. I'm sure. But I told them you  **12:05**guys are probably going to see a lot of giant  monster energy drinks, neck beards, piercings,  **12:12**goth makeup, giant oversized t-shirts, and people  playing Dungeons & Dragons and Catan until like  **12:19**3 a.m. under blue lights. Like, just be prepared  that this is the sector that we're venturing into.**12:25**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, no, it's true.   It's true. I think the background backend  principles of gaming, usability, engineering,  **12:39**what draws a person to use a product, that  type of conversation and kind of deep dive  **12:48**diligence is what I gravitate towards.  I want to know what makes people tick,   what they like, what they need, what's part of  their everyday rhythm, what makes them better.**13:01**Ben Greenfield: Now, since I brought you   on to Ben Greenfield Life, I'm just curious, what  has changed? I realize that's a loaded question  **13:10**as far as like your routine, what you've learned,  what big changes that you've made because you've  **13:15**transformed your body. I know that you're doing  a lot now as far as your own routine, what have  **13:22**been the biggest game changers for you in your  own routine, things that you've picked up here?**13:27**Caleb Applegate: Well, you've had   two guests on your podcast that made a huge  impact on me. Number one, Dallas Jenkins,  **13:35**who is a friend of yours, also a friend of  mine. Dallas was the original individual that  **13:44**got me into the film industry and helped  me out, introduced me to my entertainment  **13:50**attorney. And this is way back. This is  like 2000, I want to say 2007, maybe.**13:56**Ben Greenfield: By the way,   I'll link to that in the show notes.  Bengreenfieldlife.com/applegate is where the  **14:02**show notes are. Bengreenfieldlife.com/applegate,  Caleb's last name. But Dallas Jenkins, and I'll  **14:08**put that interview in there, he directed The  Chosen, which a lot of people are familiar with.**14:14**Caleb Applegate: Yep, he did. He's had an incredible journey,   but he gave some very practical, everyday habits  and disciplines that really spoke to me when I  **14:26**listened to that podcast. And I hadn't connected  with Dallas since he had done The Chosen,   it's been a while. But it was like, hey,  I can do this. This isn't actually that  **14:37**difficult. I can do this. Another gentleman  you had on your podcast was Michael Chernow,   Kreatures of Habit and his discipline stack.  I had to relisten to that over and over.**14:49**Caleb Applegate: I'm like, this guy has his shit together. He is   so dialed. I would say between those two and then  just being around you and just, you know, I don't  **15:02**want to be like the guy that looks like you just  ate a bag of Doritos. I want to actually, like,  **15:08**try to be better. And being around you, listening  to a few of, some of the guests that you've had  **15:15**on, I'm like, look, I've got to get serious  about this. On top of that, I have a wife who's,  **15:22**so I'm 6'3", she's 5'3", and she's a personal  trainer and loves homeopathy. Like, she has been  **15:29**the champion in our family, really pressing for  better health, better food, better environment,  **15:37**just all the way around, better ecosystem.  And I'm the guy that's been like, you know,   I have to work, I have to build, I have to create.**15:44**Caleb Applegate: I have to, you know,   make a better life for my family. All the  while, my own body is breaking down. And  **15:51**so I finally started listening to her who says,  look at these things and listen to what Ben is  **15:59**saying, like, do these things. So  I think it's been an amalgam of a   bunch of different variables that have been  very influential into my current routine.**16:09**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I get that   sometimes the spouse who says, you can't believe  how much money you've cost me after my significant  **16:17**other recommended the insert podcast here, the  Red Light podcast, the Toxic Mattress podcast,  **16:24**et cetera. So my apologies to folks who have  had their spouse introduce them to my podcast,  **16:31**but it's kind of funny. Caleb, a couple of  things came up for me as you were talking   about those podcasts that were a couple of  your favorites, the Dallas Jenkins show. I  **16:39**also learned a ton from that, one of the big  takeaways. And I don't know if you tried this,   he had debilitating low back pain. And one  of the recommendations that he gave on there,  **16:51**amongst a lot of really great recommendations for  low back pain, was to foam roll your butt. Foam  **16:56**roll your butt. And I started doing that more  intensively, like two or three times a week.**17:02**Ben Greenfield: And it is incredible   how if you kind of sit on a foam roller, you  kind of slap one leg on top of the other leg,  **17:08**and you start at the base of your knee and just  shimmy your body all the way up to your butt,   get up to your butt, weave back and forth, dig  into the tissue, then go back down to the knee,  **17:19**and you do that as about like ten passes or  so per side. And then I'll even lay myself  **17:24**on top of the foam roller and kind of like,  bring. This is difficult to describe an audio,   but I'm going to try it. I'll loop one  leg over the other leg and kind of like,  **17:33**crack the back on one side and then loop over the  other leg and crack the back on the other side.  **17:38**Not. That's an incredible move. Did you try any of  the butt foam rolling after listening to that one?**17:44**Caleb Applegate: Yeah. No, look, I didn't just   try it. I've been doing it every single day since  then. Um, that is the single biggest game changer,  **17:52**because a lot like Dallas, I, too, have lower  back pain. Or did. So I didn't just get a roller,  **17:59**though. I actually got one of those theragun  rollers where you can, like, create vibration.**18:05**Caleb Applegate: Oh, dude, game   changer. Love it. I do it every morning.  So my morning stack is a little bit of a  **18:12**blend of what Michael Chernow talked about and  Dallas talked about. So I start with rolling.  **18:18**So I'll do that a good, you know, 10, 15  minutes. And I do butt, legs, feet even.**18:25**Caleb Applegate: Then I'll jump into a workout,   usually 30 to 45 minutes. Oftentimes it's  walking or running or I do a lot of, like,  **18:34**peloton biking, which is really fun. And then I'll  jump into the sauna, do that for 25 to 30 minutes,  **18:40**hit the cold plunge. Thanks to our friends at  Morozko, I love their tub. And then have some  **18:49**quiet, meditative time, prayer time, and jump  into my workday. So even during the workouts,  **18:54**though, I'll be. I'm kind of addicted to work.  I love what I do, so I'm constantly just. Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I want to dig   into your ritual a little bit more. But you also  mentioned Michael Chernow, and apparently he went  **19:04**and flew down in high school with Lance Armstrong  in Texas. Recently, I just found out about this,   and Lance actually invested in that company  that Michael and I talked about on the show,  **19:13**the Kreatures of Habit Meal One. These little  done-for-you oatmeal packets. And I got some  **19:19**of those after the interview with him. What  I do is I soak them overnight in half-apple  **19:27**cider vinegar and half-water. And these are,  like, nostalgic flavors that you might remember   from Quaker oatmeal, if you're listening in.  Like, blueberry, and they got, like, a maple.**19:36**Ben Greenfield: It's fantastic. They   got chocolate. They got a vanilla apple cinnamon,  which is definitely nostalgic to the Quaker piece.  **19:43**You soak it overnight. These are glyphosate  free oats, and it makes, like, this kind of,   like, mushy pudding that I can use as a smoothie  filler that I can use for dessert. Like, a lot of  **19:54**times my dessert is yogurt with dark chocolate and  berries. But sometimes I'll put a spoonful of that   Meal One in there. And for travel, it's incredible  because you got these packets, you mix them up,  **20:05**you know, hotel room, you don't want to go  down to the nasty continental breakfast. Ben Greenfield: I'll even, I don't   know if I told you this, Caleb. I'll surf to  the airport. I go up to Starbucks when I want  **20:13**to have a meal in the airport because I always  have a couple of the Meal One packets in my bag,  **20:18**and I asked them what I say so I can get free  hot water because some of these basketballs will  **20:24**charge, like, $0.75 for hot water. As I say, it's  not technically a lie, but I say I have oatmeal,  **20:31**but I forgot to get hot water. Do you have hot  water in a spoon that you can give me in a cup?  **20:37**I'm sure they think I probably got the oatmeal  at Starbucks, and we're gonna get hot water at   Starbucks. But anyways, they graciously give me  the hot water, the spoon, I mix up the oatmeal,  **20:46**and this is like, you know, usually as I'm  walking to my gate, by the time I get to my gate,   it's soaked in that hot water. It's nice,  it's mushy, and I can have a meal if I'm  **20:54**traveling. And even though I often fast when I  travel, some of these longer bouts, you know,   if I've worked out in the morning, whatever,  I want some to, some to crush, it's healthy.**21:03**Ben Greenfield: So the Meal One, I'm glad you brought it up,   because that's been a winner, and it stops for  me. I got a whole pantry full of those things.**21:10**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, same. I have it   five days a week. Uh, typically, we do something  else on the weekends because we're together as a  **21:17**family, but during the week, again, game  changers. Super practical in a packet,  **21:23**and I'm moving so quick on, you know, just,  uh, in my routine in the mornings because  **21:29**I've got so much on my plate for the day,  so I've got to be ultra disciplined, like,   down to the minute. So its really  nice to just take that packet,  **21:36**dump it in. I take some walnut halves, throw it  in. I love putting the Kion colostrum into that.**21:44**Caleb Applegate: I mean, it just makes   it milky and smooth and so good. Put  some water in, maybe cut up a banana  **21:51**and a pinch of colima salt. I dont know  if youve done that. So good, man. So good.**21:57**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, its incredible. This is   turning a giant commercial for Kreatures of Habit.  But one more tip is when you soak it overnight,  **22:03**even though it's got, like, pumpkin seeds  and chia seeds, got all this stuff in it,   you put a few scoopfuls of chia seeds in  there, and it turns into, like, this thick,  **22:11**gelatinous pudding. So you can make it  even thicker with the addition of chia   seeds before you do the overnight soak. So  you gotta try that one if you haven't yet.**22:18**Caleb Applegate: As it turns out,   man, you and I are foodies.  We like to eat good food. Ben Greenfield: I know, I know.  **22:24**How has your diet actually changed since you  started? Kind of like, soaking up a lot more   from Ben Greenfield life and working behind the  scenes, you know, chatting with partners, like,  **22:34**you know, Kreatures of Habit or whatever  else, getting your hands on a lot of this   stuff. I'm just curious how it's evolved,  because, well, I mean, I'll open the kimono  **22:42**on this a little bit. You know, the town that  you and I kind of originate from and met in is  **22:49**a town that has a very kind of, like. It's  like a large reformed protestant community,  **22:56**the church that you and I attended. But  it's very much like giant Sabbath feasts   and cigar and whiskey. And it's not necessarily  focused that much on healthy diets, per se.**23:07**Ben Greenfield: I was a part of that   culture. I know you were. But I'm just  curious how it's changed from kind of  **23:12**like that general mentality to being a little  bit more aware of your nutrients in your diet.**23:19**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, well, look, you   are right. The community and culture that we've  been a part of is rich and beautiful and glorious  **23:28**and just eat the fat, really lean in and enjoy  God's bounty. I think for me personally, because  **23:38**every body type is different, being more aware  of what I'm putting into my body. In other words,  **23:45**you know, I have a propensity to like sugar  and sweets. You know, cheesecake is probably  **23:54**one of the biggest things that I've, at  least recently been, having to navigate.**23:59**Ben Greenfield: Especially, by the way,   at my mom's coffee shop that you alluded  to, they had pretty hefty cheesecake there.**24:05**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, 100%. And so I just. It's discipline,   right? I don't say no. I say sometimes, and I try  to work for it. One of the tips that you gave me,  **24:16**and this has been also a game changer. I was  actually sharing this with some folks at a new gym  **24:22**that I joined yesterday. And that is like going  to bed hungry, right? It's okay to be hungry.  **24:30**Right before the opposite of that was, I'm eating  so much that I'm constantly full. I feel bloated,  **24:38**I feel heavy, I feel thick. Going on a walk after  dinner, and I'm just like, this is miserable.**24:44**Caleb Applegate: The opposite of that   is eat just enough, portion out what you need.  Really. What is it that you need? That's the  **24:50**question that I've been asking myself. And the  feeling of being satisfied and then turning into  **24:57**that hungry state right before bed, it feels at  first you're like, man, I want to go snack or  **25:05**something. But if you hold the line, you feel  so much better. And your mind is clearer, too.**25:12**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, there's a certain character   developing, stoic, shut up, the inner bitch type  of mentality that's involved with going to bed  **25:22**hungry. But it's kind of funny, because before you  moved down to Moscow, you and I used to have a lot  **25:28**of these conversations over dinner, and I haven't  even filled you in on this yet, but now I think   you can have your cake and eat it, too. So I'll  tell you why. You know our mutual friend Martin,  **25:36**who you're doing the Shark Tank Panel with at  the Health Optimization Summit. Martin Tobias. Caleb Applegate: Love Martin. Yep.**25:42**Ben Greenfield: Okay. I don't remember   if you were at this dinner. We were down at  Lodgepole in Moscow. Let me know if this.  **25:48**If this jogs your memory or if you weren't at  this dinner. And Martin, who's also a foodie,  **25:53**he comes in, and I'd already ordered up,  like, five killer appetizers. It was, like,   pork belly and deviled eggs and these beautiful  salads. And, you know, they're wonderful.**26:04**Ben Greenfield: You know, fresh   baked warm bread with the butter there.  They put all sorts of herbs into. And  **26:09**Martin ponies up. He sits down, and I'm  watching. During the whole dinner, he has,  **26:15**like, a couple of glasses of water and half  of one of the deviled eggs. And he's like,  **26:21**I'm just not hungry. He's like, I can't eat. And  it turns out that he had started onto a zemp, the  **26:27**GLP-1 agonist, to try it out. Hopefully, I'm not  outing Martin on this show. My apologies, Martin.**26:33**Caleb Applegate: We were there. I remember this. Ben Greenfield: Yeah, okay. You were   there. He couldn't. He was nauseous. And that was  when I first started thinking about GLP-1. Now,  **26:41**long story short, since then, I've written  a lot of articles and done podcasts and some   of the dangers of long-term use of that peptide.  But the mechanism of action is to increase GLP-1  **26:52**to GLP-1 agonists, as the name implies. And that  makes you feel full. Well, since then I've been  **26:59**looking at other agents that could act similarly  that give you the same release of satiety-inducing  **27:05**hormones. There's three of them, namely GLP, one  called CCK, one called PYY. Turns out that you  **27:14**can consume certain compounds that make you feel  full and satiated, meaning you can eat less for  **27:21**say dinner or lunch if that's your vice, go to  bed, feel satisfied, but also you've eaten less.**27:31**Ben Greenfield: And two of the most powerful things   I've found besides ketone. I used to use ketones  for this for a long time, like the drinkable  **27:37**ketone esters. And now the two things are, you can  increase GLP-1 production and appetite-regulating  **27:47**hormones via your microbiome. This company called  Pendulum, they've been sponsored the podcast in  **27:53**the past. They have a probiotics called the GLP-1  probiotic. And again, I don't remember if I've  **27:59**told you about these two, Caleb, but you take it  when you wake up in the morning and it stabilizes  **28:04**your appetite throughout the day. It's acromantia,  albutericum and lactobacillus probiotic blended  **28:10**together. So that's one strategy, but  then the second one is even more powerful.**28:15**Ben Greenfield: So if you can trigger the   bitter receptors in your small intestine, then  you don't get hungry. The problem is the amount  **28:24**of bitterness that it takes to do that is highly  unpalatable. Like a lot of people will say, oh,  **28:30**use apple cider vinegar or the peels of certain  citrus fruits or bitter meal and extract or  **28:35**whatever. None of those are bitter enough to make  you full. They're bitter enough to decrease your  **28:40**blood glucose response to a meal, but not to make  you full. So there is an extract of hops, the same  **28:47**stuff that you would use to make beer. And this  company in New Zealand, they figured out how to  **28:53**extract it. It's a compound called amasarate, and  they put the capsule in a little lipid medium.**29:03**Ben Greenfield: You swallow it, it goes through your stomach   intact, it opens up in your small intestine, hits  all the bitter receptors without you having to  **29:11**taste it on your tongue because you literally like  puke, it's so bitter. And your fullness, if you  **29:16**do this, say like a couple of capsules an hour  before lunch, a couple capsules an hour before   dinner. Again, you don't. It's almost dangerous  because you want to enjoy your meal and you still  **29:27**enjoy it a little bit. But you don't think about  food. You go to bed, super full. It's almost,  **29:32**you know, you got to warn people, hey, be careful  not to lose too much weight, lose too much muscle,   etcetera. But those two are incredible. If,  you know, if you like me or a foodie and just  **29:43**go to bed thinking about food, you got to try  at least one or both of those at some point.**29:49**Caleb Applegate: Good to know.   Yeah. There's so many, I think, different  things to try here, and for me right now,  **30:00**I'm just trying to develop mental clarity  and discipline. I think it starts there.  **30:06**If I can change my mindset on things, to me  that's the biggest thing. And I have found  **30:12**personally that that's the biggest  obstacle out of the gate to conquer.**30:17**Ben Greenfield: Yeah. This is something I wanted   to ask you about because I know you've thought  about this a lot, coming from your background  **30:23**in gamification, in even community building and  accountability. What do you think is the biggest  **30:31**barrier? People who are listening in and they've  already heard about foam rolling your butt and   soaking oatmeal and chia seeds and taking a  GLP-1 agonist mimicking device and exogenous  **30:41**ketones and the Morozko cold plunge. What do you  think is the biggest barrier for people who are  **30:48**tuning into podcasts like this and just getting  dizzy in terms of the advice on how to implement?**30:54**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, it's a great   question. And I would say, and this is  just me speaking personally for myself  **30:59**and my family. It's information overload.  Like, where do you begin? What is it? Okay,  **31:06**this is the information. Why should I care? Where  does it intersect with my personal values and  **31:13**how I want to orient my life and how. And how I  think most people get tripped up because there's  **31:19**a lot of information out there. There's a lot of  influencers, brands and products and services,  **31:26**and where do you even begin? Right. It is,  it's just information complete overload.**31:34**Ben Greenfield: Guilty as charged.   So how do you think about the  information overload solution then?**31:42**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, I mean, this is just, again, personally   anecdotal. We have been walking this journey with  the Greenfield family and with a few other key  **31:53**folks like our good friend Dr. Leland Stillman,  who's been tremendous in my family's life. And  **32:00**through this process, we recognize that; a, we can  do better, b, there's a good chunk of information,  **32:12**c, how do you activate it? I think for our family,  the how has been a bit nebulous at times. It isn't  **32:22**always solvable by just changing up a supplement  or eating at different times or eating different  **32:30**portions. There are so many different variables.  And so I think this is like really good lead in to  **32:36**talk about the advent of what you and I have  been kind of concocting, creating, building,  **32:43**crafting in the background to solve these  types of problems for everyday folks like us.**32:52**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, yeah, I want to talk   about that for sure. But I don't want to leave  behind one thing. You mentioned Dr. Stillman.  **32:57**He's been on the show before. He's a genius when  it comes to the type of testing that he does,   and then the replenishment program that you start  on afterwards. What'd you learn from him? Or was  **33:08**there anything you found out about your body  that you changed after working with Leland? Caleb Applegate: Yeah. One thing that I really  **33:14**respect about Dr. Stillman is just that he's calm,  he's collected, and he doesn't panic. Right. You  **33:22**might have an issue or you might think you're  dying. He's like, no, you're not. And here's what  **33:28**we need to do. And I like that calm, disciplined,  sober-minded leadership. So it isn't just applying  **33:36**medical prowess or information that he has,  it's also his guidance through the process.**33:43**Caleb Applegate: And so I think   what he and I have talked about over the  past several years, or couple of years,  **33:51**is just how to make the process easier for  everyday folks. What do I mean by that?  **34:00**Everyone is bio custom individual. You might see  a great advertisement for the latest supplement  **34:08**package. Doesn't mean that you need that  though. And I think that's something I've   come to learn. Some products look incredibly  sexy and I want to try this and it's awesome.**34:18**Ben Greenfield: It does mean you need it if your neighbor   or your favorite biohacker or transhumanist is  taking it to live to 160, it must be, right?**34:26**Caleb Applegate: Exactly. But I think what   working with Dr. Stillman has shown me is that  that isn't always the case. Everybody's different.  **34:35**Every body is different. And so using that as  your starting point and going what's your body  **34:42**telling you? What data can we extract from, say a  Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis? You might have heavy  **34:51**metals that's creating toxicity in your body.  You might be deficient. You and I, Ben, we live  **34:57**in the Pacific Northwest, which means we might  not get as much vitamin D as someone that lives   down in Arizona, right? So there are variables  and factors that play into this. And so as  **35:08**this bio custom outlook kind of takes shape, it's  important to know that it's not one size fits all.**35:17**Caleb Applegate: And that's been a game   changer in our family because we would just go  with the typical supplements protocol or typical,  **35:26**hey, this influencer says we need this. Turns  out our chemistry might not actually need that.**35:33**Ben Greenfield: The HTMA, the Hair   Tissue Mineral Analysis that you mentioned.  I actually really like that. It's a perfect  **35:39**example of what you're talking about, right? It's  like 100, maybe a little bit more, dollar test.  **35:45**You get it. And a lot of people are like, well,  it only tells me minerals and toxins. It doesn't   tell me everything else, but everything from your  copper to your zinc ratios to your sodium levels,  **35:54**potassium levels, indicators of sympathetic  and parasympathetic nervous system balance.  **35:59**There is a ton that you can glean from  that one test. I actually took Leland's  **36:04**entire HTMA course to learn how to interpret  it better and just learned that, oh my gosh,   this is more than just like a simple hair  test for metals and toxins and minerals.**36:13**Ben Greenfield: Like, it goes pretty deep.   And it is kind of cool how even though you can do  like, I've interviewed the folks from Wild Health,  **36:21**the fancy multi-thousand dollar executive  panel and the full body mris and the full   genome analysis and the metabolomics report for  fatty acids and amino acids and micronutrients  **36:32**and all these things that you can do that  we, and certainly people like Dr. Stillman  **36:38**walk people through. The HTMA is a perfect  example of taking the seemingly complex world  **36:45**of self-quantification and at least trying  to introduce some amount of simplicity to it. Caleb Applegate: 100%. It gives you a baseline to build  **36:52**off of data is important. It's really important.  And I would say that data without overload is a  **37:02**great starting point. Just show me the basics  that explain how I'm feeling, maybe why I'm  **37:09**feeling a certain way, so that we can quickly get  into the how. How do we start to solve for this?**37:16**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I mean, I know that you. It's kind   of interesting because you're unique. I may call  you an Avatar, Caleb, even though you're not blue,  **37:24**your unique avatar in that. You know, I met you  when you were really wanting to be healthier.  **37:33**You're super interested in a lot of the biohacks  that I was talking about. And for a lot of people,  **37:39**it is not to kick that live to 160 horse to death,  but it's not about bragging rights for living the  **37:45**longest time or owning the half-million dollars  worth of biohacks or whatever. It's more about  **37:53**having more productivity being unleashed to create  more wealth, having time available and left over  **38:01**after your fitness and your self-preservation  efforts for family and hobbies and career and  **38:08**social life, etc. And so, you know, I would  love to hear how you kind of, you know, in your  **38:16**situation, think about or thought about or began  to tackle this issue that you kind of ran into.**38:22**Ben Greenfield: At least I think   this is the way you kind of explained  to me, like, just knowing me, you know,   as my friend, you get bombarded with a lot  of information. Then once you came on at Ben  **38:31**Greenfield Life is just more information through  the firehose of health. And, you know, you kind  **38:39**of came up with some solutions or potential ways  to reduce some of that complexity and confusion.**38:46**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, you're absolutely right. And again,   so much of what you and I have talked about has  been anecdotal. This is me personally, my family,  **38:55**and our personal journey. And part of the issues  that we've hit up against time and time again is;  **39:03**a, there's a ton of information out there,  b, what do you do with it? And does all of  **39:09**it pertain to you? Right. You might see really  cool supplements, but they may not be for your  **39:17**bio custom individual self. And every body  is different, as we said earlier. So it's  **39:23**sifting through all the noise. There's a  lot of noise, but it doesn't stop there.**39:28**Caleb Applegate: Let's say you get down   a path with a functional medicine doctor. How do  you know if it's working? You started taking those  **39:35**supplements. Do you feel better? Is it placebo?  Are you really starting to see change? There's new  **39:41**and different ideas and opinions and things that  are always surfacing. Right. Who do you listen to?**39:48**Ben Greenfield: Right? Or worse yet, by the way,   because I run into this a lot, you listen to like  20 different podcasts, and you've woven through  **39:56**maybe like four or five different doctors, and  you've got like four shells in your pantry of  **40:03**all the supplements and creams and lotions and  transdermals that you started on with one person  **40:08**or heard about on a podcast, and now you just  kind of almost like, dizzy when you walk into   your pantry or open your refrigerator trying to  figure out what to take and what's right for you.**40:19**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, exactly. And the thing that you   and I have discussed a ton through this process  of my journey, my family's journey, is if that's  **40:29**happening with us, we can surely assume that it's  happening with a lot of other folks out there. And  **40:36**so as you and I started thinking through, not just  the problems, but what could potential solutions  **40:44**look like. We've, from the outset, been thinking  about what we're coining as the every person.  **40:52**Right. We think about the folks who are busy  running their kids back and forth from school  **40:58**and husbands going to work and trying to build a  career. We're not just talking about, you know,  **41:05**the elites, the top tier class A executives.  We're talking about folks, just everyday folks,  **41:12**who know something is off. We're trying to figure  out easy solutions for that group of folks.**41:21**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, it's a really good point too,   because I get this a lot. People come up to me at  conferences or at events and they're like, well,  **41:27**I want to get healthy, but I'm not as extreme  as you. Or they think the person I'm talking  **41:33**to is the elite biohacker or they have to sign  up for some super duper, admittedly expensive  **41:40**private VIP coaching program with me in order to  get healthy. And that's one thing that you and I  **41:46**have been talking about just the past few months  is I've created journeys and transformations, but  **41:53**they're expensive and they're one-on-one and you  got to sign up to work with me. And furthermore,  **41:59**like I don't even work with more than ten people  in a month, but yet we have all this information,  **42:06**all this content, all these connections, all  these vetted and curated companies and products,  **42:14**all of these, all this information. But you're a  way better architect than me, Caleb. Cause for me,  **42:23**you walk into my office, it's not exactly  clean, but I kind of know where everything is.   Whereas you're good at kind of  architecting a journey for someone,  **42:32**to so-called transformation or something, that  they might be seeking in the world of health.**42:38**Ben Greenfield: So when you presented   to me the idea of the next evolution of Ben  Greenfield Life, I was actually pretty excited  **42:48**about it. But I'd love for you to share in  your own words what you were kind of like   laying awake thinking about at night and then,  you know, voxering me about in the mornings.**42:58**Caleb Applegate: Well, you are correct.   You are the mad scientist, right? I go into your  zen den and you've got the coolest gadgets on the  **43:06**planet and they're all, like, incredible in their  own right. The question that you and I have been  **43:12**wrestling with is how do we take that and somehow  make that or a version of that or information,  **43:19**the science behind that available to all people.  And so yeah, we really started transitioning to  **43:28**what if. What if there was a place, one place,  not walled gardens everywhere, which you see in  **43:35**a lot of different spaces, especially in the  health and wellness space. What if there was   one house with lots of different rooms? Rooms  with the best products, the best curated core  **43:47**contributing experts in their various fields,  all in that health and wellness space. What  **43:54**if they could offer their services? And what  if you could build community around that? So,  **43:59**in essence, what if it was the public square  of all things transformation geared for you  **44:07**and for your desired health transformation  outcomes. Like, this is a game changer.**44:12**Caleb Applegate: And this was the thing that I think   you and I together identified early on is that  that didn't really exist. And the what if became,  **44:22**well, let's build it. Let's start putting  the pieces together. Where do we begin? And  **44:27**that's where the architecture really came  into place. But you've built a lifetime of  **44:33**incredible relationships. You've tried some  of the coolest gear on the planet, really.  **44:38**My job is just now building the architecture  that connects it all and threads the needle. Ben Greenfield: Early on, we were talking about podcasts,  **44:46**right? There's maybe somebody subscribes like  15 different health podcasts. So you have all   this information flying out there. It's not  structured. You don't know exactly what to do  **44:55**with it. But you have this information jumbling  around inside your head, and you're grabbing a   little bit here and a little bit there, and maybe  have a few friends who are doing the same thing,  **45:04**but they might listen to a few different podcasts  and have their own approach. And then from a book  **45:09**standpoint, you've got something like Boundless,  right, which you referred to as the Bible earlier   in the podcast. Well, that's also kind of  a cookbook full of a lot of information,  **45:19**but you don't necessarily open it, take your  finger, point, click, and all of a sudden be  **45:24**able to have a program designed for you that  leaps out from the, say, the sleep chapter or  **45:32**the hormones chapter or the longevity chapter.  And so what got me excited when I was talking  **45:38**to you early on in this process of what do we  do with all this information to actually make  **45:43**it accessible in a way that allows to someone,  that allows someone to actually time hack this,  **45:50**transform themselves, but also kind of like,  have all these experts in your back pocket,  **45:55**like, actually accessible to you to be able  to be like, hey, Ben, I have a question. Ben Greenfield: Hey, you know, I'm going to hop on the Wednesday  **46:01**AMA and ask Ben this, and it correlates directly  to the program that's been created for me that me  **46:07**and other members of a community are following to,  say, optimize sleep, or optimize hormones or lose  **46:13**fat or we're on a, you know, a transformation  challenge this month for, say, buttery hips and  **46:21**mobility, or whatever the case may be. So we threw  around a few ideas, but I don't remember which one  **46:30**of us or a team member or whatever came up with  the idea of, like, a network? We bandied about a  **46:38**few terms, but really what we've settled on is  this idea of a life network, right? All things  **46:46**life optimization within one network that's not  expensive, that consolidates all this information,  **46:55**that gives you access to your favorite experts  and also gives you a roadmap to follow and a  **47:01**community to support you and have fun with  you along that journey of transformation.**47:08**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, no, beautifully   said. Here's the thing. I've spent years  and years and years designing products,  **47:15**experiences using gamification, really  digging into usability, engineering this  **47:21**next chapter of my life together with you and  the tremendous team at Ben Greenfield Life.  **47:28**We want to help you design your outcomes,  design your transformation outcomes. This  **47:34**is about you and your journey. Again, so much  of this was anecdotal for me and my family,  **47:40**right? I ignored, ignored, ignored. Now I'm  like information overload. How do I distill  **47:47**it and create act real action orientation around  it? Not just I'm going to get a gym membership,  **47:54**not just I'm going to try to get a little bit  more sleep or that's a cool supplement over there.**48:00**Caleb Applegate: We want you to connect with things that are going   to create real, lasting, both short and long-term  true transformation. So it's, yeah, Life Network  **48:10**is, I think, it's the future. I think it takes the  power of data tracking with wearables and a lot  **48:18**of the cool products that are out there. And it  also lets us, like, that's a foundational building  **48:23**block. It allows us to use that data coupled with  real community data points. Like, how did you  **48:32**participated in a challenge? You did that workout.  Who's tracking that? And one of the beautiful  **48:38**things with Life Network is that we emphasize four  key things: mind, body, spirit, and community.**48:46**Caleb Applegate: These are the things that we've identified   as our core pillars. What if you could have, this  goes back to the what if, right? What if you could  **48:54**have a life performance score, more holistic view?  Not just how you slept or your HRV, but looking  **49:03**at the whole picture of things. So really, life  network becomes a health tracking concierge team.**49:11**Ben Greenfield: I'm doing it right now,   by the way, Caleb, I'm wearing the Life Network  branded ultra human ring. I think you have one,  **49:17**too. Yeah, that's just like a sneak peek.  If people are watching the video, it's at  **49:22**bengreenfieldlife.com/applegate. Literally, blood  glucose, sleep, blood and biomarkers, activity,  **49:29**HRV, meditation sessions, breath work, coaching,  all built into one beautiful curated ring,  **49:36**right? That's available to our members. Rinse,  wash, and repeat that with your sauna and cold  **49:42**plunge package, with your home environmental  optimization package, etc. And it's kind of funny,  **49:47**Caleb, because, well, inside baseball for folks,  we have these really fun annual Ben Greenfield  **49:55**Life team retreats where we bring the whole team  together. And I crafted a vision two years ago  **50:02**at the team retreat in which I described how,  probably because I'm kind of like a content  **50:07**junkie and autodidact, I love to digest all this  information from the healthosphere and then turn   around and figure out a way to package  that and make it palatable for people.**50:17**Ben Greenfield: I architect, or I describe the   vision of like a podcast network, right? What if  we took what we've done with me and then we have,  **50:27**you know, we're generating revenue from ads,  but we've got the mommy endurance runner,  **50:34**and the swimmer, and the weightlifter, and  the biohacker, and the nutrition junkie, etc.,  **50:41**etc. And that was kind of sort of a cool idea. But  you really showed me that people don't need just a  **50:51**bunch more content, right? They need an actual  journey, and they need it structured in such  **50:57**a way that they actually have a plan to follow.  And yet, I actually am excited about the content  **51:05**part of the Life Network, too, because we have  taken this idea of podcasters, albeit ad free,  **51:13**hooray, within the Life Network. But tell me  about the idea of the actual content in there,  **51:18**especially like the podcast, AMA,  audio, video, learning type of stuff.**51:24**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, I think you hit on some really important   things here. One thing that I will highlight is  the thing that I'm the most excited about is,  **51:34**to your point, what do you do with all this  information? What our family needed, what I needed  **51:40**was movement. Constant movement. Forward, one step  at a time. Movement. In community. And then how do  **51:49**you take that information to make better informed  decisions about yourself, your health patterns,  **51:55**and then how can you contribute back into  the community? It's a beautiful flywheel,   actually. When we look at the content inside of  Life Network, it has a communal aspect to it.  **52:07**It's very dynamic. Instead of I'm reading this and  it's transactional, here's what I mean by that.**52:13**Caleb Applegate: You don't just jump into Life Network and you're   met with a bunch of different articles or some  of Ben's beautifully produced, epic masterclass  **52:24**course content. It is that, but it's so much more.  You mentioned shows, so we have a show, a weekly  **52:31**show called Triumph Weekly. This is the summary  of all things happening on the network. Everything  **52:38**from, we've got this VIP cooking event coming  up. Members only. There's 50 spots, this Friday.**52:46**Caleb Applegate: Make sure you don't forget   to join. Set your timer and be first in line.  We've got different core-contributing experts  **52:55**that we'll bring onto the Triumph Weekly Show. And  this is only like a 10 to 15 minutes show. Think   of it like a news anchor. Kind of like, here's all  things happening in the networks. Because it's a  **53:04**community. We want to celebrate wins. We want  to highlight achievements. Even if you didn't  **53:12**win a challenge, the fact that you participated,  you just got there is a win in and of itself. We  **53:21**will have challenges. We'll have different  shows. We have our new team, Team Triumph.**53:27**Ben Greenfield: RAW. We have RAW. Caleb Applegate: Right? Right. Go   ahead. You talk about RAW. This is your thing.**53:34**Ben Greenfield: Okay, I'll talk about   Rob. By the way, you were mentioning  Team Triumph. Many of you were on the  **53:39**ladder platform where you're following my  workouts. For those of you who missed that,   that's all going to be in Life Network now  as part of Team Triumph. So you get your  **53:50**daily workouts. I'll let Caleb and a little bit  tell you about the super slick interface. Like,   we have not messed around as far as the interface  goes and the usability. But part of this,  **54:00**too is like, I have thoughts sometimes when I'm  interviewing a guest, I only have so much time.**54:07**Ben Greenfield: Typically there's an hour to an hour and 15   minutes allotted for me to interview somebody. I  often keep my mouth shut when I disagree or when I  **54:17**want to argue back at a point. I often have things  I want to share post-show that are on my mind that  **54:24**I don't get a chance to share just cause there's  only so much time in the day. And a lot of times I   have things that I know I want the guests to talk  about that we just don't have time to get to. If  **54:33**I'm constantly interrupting them and arguing and  pushing back and sharing my own thoughts, etc.   You guys listen to the podcast, you probably hear  that I try not to talk over the guests too much.**54:43**Ben Greenfield: I also have things that   I want to talk about that go way beyond the twice  monthly Q&A's that I do like. Tons of tips from,  **54:53**gosh, the RAW episodes or everything from things  I'm doing for big toe and low back mobility, to  **55:00**new family and relationship habits, to different  ways I've been tapping into some of the appetite  **55:07**control stuff Caleb and I were talking about  earlier. I wanted an ad free platform where I  **55:14**could just talk to you like you and me having  a phone conversation where, hey, here's the. I   actually have some clients who will do this to me.  Like, they'll pay for a consultation and they'll  **55:23**lead off the consultation with. So, Ben, tell  me what you haven't been talking about in the   podcast. Tell me about the new things you've  discovered lately that are working for you.**55:32**Ben Greenfield: And basically, like my podcast and the Life   Network, the RAW show, is just that. It's quick,  it's edgy, it's me. It's like 30 minutes long,  **55:43**and it's literally just my chance to, to share  the stuff that I just don't get a chance to   share with you on this normal podcast feed, the  one you're listening to right now, in an ad free  **55:53**environment with the ability for you to be able  to interact with me within that environment.  **55:59**We're talking like AMA's forums, not just me,  but the other experts within the platform.  **56:04**I'm pretty excited about The RAW Podcast,  Caleb. It's been fun to record the first few. Caleb Applegate: I know, and you're crushing it. It's  **56:11**amazing because you're right. You have so much in  your orbit that's happening. All the crazy stuff  **56:17**that you get introduced to, the people that you  get to meet. I'm personally really excited about  **56:23**RAW with Ben Greenfield because it is, it's like  meeting Oz behind the curtain. So it's going to be  **56:29**super fun. So we've got RAW, we've got Triumph  Weekly. We've got several other shows that are  **56:36**already in production that will launch post-MVP of  Life Network, which we are hoping for-August ish.  **56:45**Around that timeline, we'll be doing a friends  and family release of that. We also, Team Triumph,  **56:52**like you mentioned. But this is the biggest thing  I think I'm the most excited about. We're going  **56:57**to be hosting debates. Do you want to talk for  a minute about this? Because this was really,  **57:03**this was your brainchild, and I know we've  kind of ideated together, but this is so cool.**57:10**Ben Greenfield: Okay, so this is something.   It's kind of like herding cats for me. But I've  got some really good debates that I'm going to be  **57:19**moderating. I got Sean Baker and Joel Green doing  carnivore versus omnivore. I have a doctor who  **57:26**hates stem cells debating a doctor who is super  into stem cells. I'm doing seed oils are bad  **57:33**versus seed oils are good. Just about, you know,  keto versus, you know, a high carb diet is better  **57:40**for the thyroid and for metabolism, anything  that you've heard on two different podcasts  **57:46**and you wish those people would just step into  like celebrity death match and go at each other.**57:52**Ben Greenfield: We're doing that within   the Life's Network. So basically juicy, juicy  debates on all the topics related to health,  **58:01**nutrition, fitness, biohacking. So  that's kind of another cool feature. Caleb Applegate: Yeah, 100%. And there is  **58:09**no other platform that's going to spotlight  conversation like this. Like X is great,  **58:16**but it's such a generalized public square. What  we're aiming to create here is a safe place  **58:25**around health, wellness and life optimization. So  conversation movements in community, we're here  **58:31**together. And then you and I, it doesn't just  stop there. We have really exciting plans to  **58:36**take this digital environment and kind of touch it  down locally, practically. So lots of cool stuff.**58:42**Caleb Applegate: We'll have our own   merchandise line that we're dropping with some  really epic, like Triumph t-shirts. We've got,  **58:49**I mean, the list goes on and on. I cannot wait  for the public to see this and experience it. The  **58:55**other thing that I want to highlight here, because  we've talked about, what are some of the cool  **59:00**things inside the Network. But one of the biggest  things that just to be transparent for a minute,  **59:09**that you and I have talked about is making  this accessible and affordable for everybody,  **59:15**right? Looking at the health and wellness space,  there's some just incredible products out there.  **59:21**Our desire, though, and I think our family's  desire, is to make sure that every person on  **59:29**the planet has access to this. Which means it  needs to be ultra affordable, right? We have  **59:37**operating costs, there's a baseline fee, but we've  put this thing at 16.99 a month. 16.99 a month.**59:44**Ben Greenfield: $16. Not 1,699. $16.99.**59:50**Caleb Applegate: That's exactly   right. Which is a game changer. It  doesn't exist in this space. Right?**59:56**Ben Greenfield: And look, by the way,   folks, I kind of like, let's not beat around  the bush. I own Ben Greenfield Life. It's how  **1:00:03**I feed my family. And when Caleb came to me, he's  like, we can do this at $16.99 a month. I'm like,  **1:00:10**oh, I don't know if we're going to actually  generate any meaningful revenue from that,  **1:00:18**but it's really about a lot of people in the  community. We want to build a massive tribe  **1:00:26**and a network. And sure there's things within  the Life Network. Like if you join for $16.99,  **1:00:32**you're not going to get like the $400 ring, right?  Like we make certain things accessible within  **1:00:37**the Life Network that you then get access to as a  member that you can't get unless you're a member.**1:00:42**Ben Greenfield: But all the content,   all the podcasts, all the debates, all the  community, all the Team Triumph workouts,  **1:00:49**all of the forums, everything is $16.99 a month.**1:00:55**Caleb Applegate: Yeah. It is your one-stop home,   your family, your community of like minded  individuals who are wanting the exact same  **1:01:05**thing. And that is to feel better and take that  desire and contribute back into the community.  **1:01:12**Pour back into the community. Somebody asked  me, or I've been asked several times recently,  **1:01:19**what are you expecting in terms of  users? And this is really important,   and I do feel compelled to share this. I've  said this over and over and over again. If we  **1:01:30**get 50 people out of the gate, I want to make  sure those 50 people are loved on so much and  **1:01:38**that they are experiencing real outcomes and feel  valued, that they want to tell 50 other people,  **1:01:46**so on and so forth. Our goal is to make this  boutique experience be the best, most world class  **1:01:55**experience on the planet, where you're not just  getting information, but you're getting engaged.**1:02:02**Ben Greenfield: Yeah. Yeah. And it's consolidated   and curated. I want to tell a story to drive  my point home. When I first started my podcast,  **1:02:10**this was like 17 years ago, right? This was before  River and Terran were born. That I was this,  **1:02:15**you know, freckle-faced personal trainer with a,  af you go back and find episode one, super high  **1:02:22**pitched voice, you know, skinny kids sitting in  the gym, opening up my age old computer with the  **1:02:32**computer camera turned on, talking into the camera  and like, thumbing through strength conditioning   journals and research. It was like 17 episodes  in when I interviewed my first official guest.**1:02:43**Ben Greenfield: I think it was Angela   Nath. Shout out to Angela. I think she  still listens to the show. Professional   cyclist and triathlete. There was maybe like  Gillian Michaels, Dave Asprey, Rob Wolf.  **1:02:56**I think Joe Rogan had a podcast. I don't remember,  but there were less than 100 podcasts, period.  **1:03:03**This is where you had to hard code your RSS feed  to Apple, wait two weeks for it to get accepted.**1:03:10**Ben Greenfield: If it was over something stupid,   like 100 megabytes, if any line of code was messed  up, your podcast would disappear. And this was  **1:03:20**like the dinosaur days of podcasting.  Well, kind of like blogging, you know,  **1:03:25**in the way that blogging transformed from the late  90s to the mid 2000s, you know, podcasting from  **1:03:31**the early 2000s to present day. Even if you just  talk about, like, health and fitness, podcasts  **1:03:37**has absolutely blown up. There are thousands  and thousands of podcasts which means a stream  **1:03:45**of information that you could listen to all day  long at 4x speed that you still would not be able  **1:03:52**to get through listening 7 days a week. So one of  the ways I think about the Life Network is what if  **1:04:00**it was all consolidated and curated, and all you  had to do was open the Life Network and just have  **1:04:05**those podcasts? Like, that's all the information  you need. We split it. Mind, body, spirit.**1:04:11**Ben Greenfield: You've got all the advice you need. I'm looking   over everything. I'm vetting all the guests,  I'm vetting all the experts. It's an ad free  **1:04:18**environment. Yeah, I mean, I don't want to shoot  myself in the foot here. You're still going to get   a lot of value out of this podcast that you're  listening to right now. But imagine if you were  **1:04:26**listening to this podcast. Let's say something  about, I don't know, haptic therapy for sleep.**1:04:32**Ben Greenfield: And you could actually go   within the Life Network and on the weekly AMA say,  hey Ben, how come you didn't ask the guests XYZ,  **1:04:39**and are you actually using ABC? Right. You can  actually interact with me within the Life Network  **1:04:45**in a much more personal way. And not just me,  but all these other experts and podcasters,   by the way, many of which you're going to be  familiar with when you join the Life Network.  **1:04:53**You're going to be blown away by the people we  have in there. But the way I think about it is   in an era of information overload, why not just  cut to the chase, get the stuff you want, and  **1:05:05**be supported by a community and experts who are  ensuring you get the most out of that information.**1:05:13**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, very well said. Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I agree. Simplicity, affordability,  **1:05:19**accessibility and just a world class experience  making it simple for people to understand  **1:05:26**what they need and what they  need to get in community.**1:05:32**Ben Greenfield: Caleb, I'm sure   people are wondering, and this is probably the  dumbest thing I've ever said on my podcast,  **1:05:39**but I don't remember what the  URL is for the Life Network. Caleb Applegate: Golifenetwork.com.  **1:05:44**We're not live yet. We're almost there. Ben Greenfield: We might be by the time this podcast comes out. Caleb Applegate: We might be. This  **1:05:51**is the beautiful thing. We're not promising  the future. We've built it. It's functional,  **1:05:56**it works. We have an active, pretty big dev  team working on this, doing an incredible job.  **1:06:02**Our entire team is filling this platform, this  network, with all sorts of incredible content,  **1:06:09**all the way from our coaching team, to our  partnerships team, to podcasts and all these  **1:06:14**new shows that we're creating again. Shout  out to our amazing team at Ben Greenfield  **1:06:19**Life. But everybody is incorporating into their  daily rhythms just content and contributions  **1:06:26**into the network. So this thing is going to be  rocking. I cannot wait to unveil it to the world.**1:06:32**Ben Greenfield: Yeah. And then a huge amount   of gratefulness to you, Caleb, because as you guys  listening and heard, we're talking like, you know,  **1:06:41**mineplex engine passages, taking all this  knowledge of how to make a slick user interface  **1:06:50**that's accessible, that's gamified, that's fun,  that doesn't break every hour while you're on it,  **1:06:56**and then marry that to the best of  the best. From health, from fitness,   from biohacking, from longevity, nutrition,  supplementation, etc. This is where, Caleb,  **1:07:05**you came in at a really clutch point, like being  able to actually pull this off from a technical  **1:07:13**standpoint. And for all you listening in, I know  we're getting a little long in the tooth here,   so we'll wrap up pretty soon, but you have to  see what this experience is like. And I mean,  **1:07:23**you heck, just like, you know, when  it's ready, go join. You don't,   you don't have to stay in if you don't want  to. Although I, I doubt that will be the case.**1:07:30**Ben Greenfield: But if you just want to surf around, see   what it looks like. Golifenetwork.com. And I mean,  yeah, I was even showing my wife and kids and  **1:07:38**they're like, wow, this is really professional.  This looks really good. And you don't see  **1:07:44**that a lot in the health and fitness space.  Something that's beautiful, but that also works.**1:07:50**Caleb Applegate: Yeah. I was on with one of our newly onboarded   core-contributing experts that probably so many  folks listening to the Ben Greenfield Life podcast  **1:08:02**would instantly recognize. And she, she was blown  away. And she said, and I quote, you have no idea  **1:08:11**how this is going to change lives. This is the  most beautiful platform I have ever seen in this  **1:08:18**space, end quote. And that was really encouraging  from a guy who doesn't come from the health and  **1:08:23**wellness space to be able to take my background,  kind of the culmination of everything that I've  **1:08:29**learned, intersect that with your expertise,  your relationships, all the knowledge base that  **1:08:36**you bring in and mash that all together, is really  exciting to see all of that come to life. So I am,  **1:08:44**man, I couldn't be more thrilled. Thank you  for the opportunity for believing in this   and allowing us this opportunity to release a  platform that will help change people's lives.**1:08:55**Ben Greenfield: Well, if you're listening in,   you know that I'm moving to Idaho. It just  so happens I'm moving about 20 minutes away  **1:09:02**from Caleb. So we're gonna keep building, keep  architecting, keep creating beautiful things that  **1:09:08**will change your life and transform you. And  the Life Network is now the hub for that.

Ben Greenfield: Guilty as charged.  **0:11**So how do you think about the  information overload solution then? Caleb Applegate: I think this is like a really good   lead in to talk about the advent of what you and I  have been kind of concocting, creating, building,  **0:24**crafting in the background to solve these  types of problems for everyday folks like us.**0:32**Ben Greenfield: I am super excited about  **0:44**today's show because I get to interview  my best friend. And even though you   might be wondering why the heck I'd just be  interviewing one of my pals on the podcast,  **0:53**it goes way beyond that. So if you listen to  my show, if you read my articles on my website,  **1:00**follow me on social media, or digest anything from  Ben Greenfield Life, the man at the helm of the  **1:08**amazing team working at Ben Greenfield Life.  And the president of the company is my guest  **1:14**on today's show, Caleb Applegate. Caleb, he'll  share with you his deep history and an impressive  **1:24**career leading up to, coming up to Ben Greenfield  Life. But I thought, gosh, there's so much that  **1:30**you guys get that is produced in the secret Batman  labs up here in the inland northwest that I gotta  **1:38**get the man behind the scenes on the show because  he's a wealth of knowledge, not just in business,  **1:44**but he's also tuned into the health, the  biohacking, the fitness world and beyond.**1:50**Ben Greenfield: And you're actually gonna start seeing Caleb   more and more places, too. For example, he'll  be presenting at the Health Optimization Summit  **1:56**coming up in London. Although this podcast might  be coming out after that show, you're going to see  **2:01**him a lot more popping up with some new projects  that we have going at Ben Greenfield Life as well.  **2:07**So I thought, what the heck, Caleb? I might as  well have you on the show. What do you think? Caleb Applegate: Ben, thanks for  **2:12**having me, man. Pleasure to be here. Ben Greenfield: Yeah. And you have   a pretty funny story that you tell.  I think you tell it better than me  **2:20**about how we actually connected up here in  Spokane. It involves me dirty and barefoot.**2:29**Caleb Applegate: It does involve you   dirty and barefoot, dialed in, zoned in on  one of your walking calls outside. But yeah,  **2:37**you're right. It's funny. This was right during  the middle, or actually at the beginning of  **2:43**COVID. We were looking for land. We have three  kids. My wife and I decided, hey, this is a good  **2:50**time to go get on a piece of property. And  so we actually were able to get something.**2:57**Caleb Applegate: Turns out, what, ten minutes from your old place,   North Spokane. And literally, the day that  we're moving, we're driving down the road,  **3:06**and I see this guy, barefoot, shirtless, walking  down the road, like, in the zone as you're   walking. And I'm like, wait a minute, I know this  guy. Turns out I didn't have your number anymore  **3:18**because we had met years before, through your mom,  actually, and I had to message you on Facebook,  **3:26**dude, I think we just moved ten minutes from  where you're at. We should get together. And   that kind of began the next season of our  families getting together quite often.**3:37**Ben Greenfield: Yeah. And at the time, you weren't, at least   to my recollection, you were super tuned into  the health and biohacking world at that point.**3:50**Caleb Applegate: No. That may be an understatement. No. In fact,   I would ping you all the time, if you recall, hey,  what do you think about this? Or, hey, I'm feeling  **4:00**a certain way, and you would always send me,  because you've probably written about literally  **4:06**everything. You have, the Bible. With Boundless,  it's easy for you to just like, hey, check out  **4:12**this article, or, I just did this podcast, or  you'd really get a lot of information extracted  **4:17**out of this new thing we just put out. And so  it was like you were the information repository,  **4:24**and I was like, holy smokes, this guy is dialed  in. I have to just have to keep asking questions.**4:30**Caleb Applegate: So I was probably that,   at least at first, that annoying  guy that kept pinging you.**4:36**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, it kind of went both ways, though,   because you were, like, the expert on business  building, the metaverse, information technology,  **4:45**crypto, all these things I didn't know much  about. I think that would actually be interesting   for people. Before we talk about the direction  that you've taken with health and fitness and  **4:55**what your routines and rituals are looking like  now. Where'd you actually come from before that? Caleb Applegate: Right, yeah, no, it's a great  **5:01**question. In fact, a pastor friend of ours likes  to say, God draws straight with crooked lines, and  **5:08**I'm definitely that crooked line story. And so,  yeah, years ago, I started in the entertainment  **5:15**space. I was blessed enough to have my first film  produced by Leonardo DiCaprio's company, Appian  **5:23**Way. And so that was kind of the first push into  the film industry, into the entertainment space,  **5:30**and it was an amazing experience, once in a  lifetime opportunity. I was able to take my  **5:35**family, but we made the decision at that  point that we didn't want to live in LA  **5:41**and raise our kids in LA. And so we landed  in Moscow, Idaho, where I would eventually  **5:48**meet you and other really great friends.  And we fell in love with the community.**5:54**Caleb Applegate: And we knew because we were making   that choice, the entertainment industry might  not be as accessible. I would have to travel a  **6:01**lot. And so we looked at alternative opportunities  on more of a local level. And it was through that  **6:09**that I opened a restaurant. And Moscow was  able to experiment with a few startups, but  **6:15**ultimately started offering consulting services.  And it wasn't that I put myself out there as the  **6:22**people would ask me advice on things, or, hey,  would you be willing to step in and help with  **6:30**this particular project? And one of  those projects, as it turns out, was a   Minecraft gaming server that needed some business  development executive help. And so I was able to,  **6:42**kind of the TLDR version of that was, I'm  not a gamer at all, but I did love business,  **6:50**and so was able to make the connection  with Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks,  **6:57**and envision and dream the American  Airlines center arena inside of Minecraft.  **7:04**And so ultimately this got the attention of  Microsoft and Mojang, all things considered.**7:10**Caleb Applegate: Long story short,   our server, Mineplex, was one of three that  helped pioneer the Minecraft marketplace that  **7:17**we know today. And we were super early, but  helped kind of build that all out. So it was  **7:23**an amazing experience. Then you mentioned  metaverse. This is where things get even  **7:29**more just funny and odd. It was through the  gaming ecosystem, we were using this gaming  **7:41**community connector. It was called Enjin.  This was pre-NFTs, pre-Enjin Coin ICO.**7:52**Caleb Applegate: We were using the   Enjin client. And so through that process  of getting to know the team over there,  **8:00**we started working together. And so they  brought me on as an advisor. And then  **8:05**after a good amount of time of helping  them kind of see things a bit different,  **8:11**they asked if I would come on board as a COO. So  I ran Enjin, which was then a top 50 blockchain  **8:17**company for four years. Had a blast, have huge  respect for those guys. Was able to co-found a  **8:24**token over there called EFI on Polkadot. And so,  yeah, became it was just all things blockchain.**8:31**Caleb Applegate: Taking what I've learned   from gamification, but really digging into the  software stack of things and understanding how  **8:39**information moves. Consequently, or I should  say, incidentally, Enjin pioneered the whole  **8:47**concept of a non-fungible token. This was  early days, 2017, right alongside cryptopunks,  **8:55**Witek Radomski, the CTO and co-founder of  Enjin, pioneered ERC 1155 standard and had  **9:04**envisioned this whole, what we coined a  multiverse where a game could mint items,  **9:12**melt them and remint them in another game. In  fact, it was a non-fungible token that actually  **9:19**had value in an ecosystem of interoperability. So  that's the whole metaverse Web3 NFT intersection.**9:30**Ben Greenfield: So my very rudimentary understanding   of that would be like the ninja sort of power  that I acquired in one game could actually  **9:36**have some type of value and be traded across  a different platform or something like that?**9:42**Caleb Applegate: Yep, absolutely. Absolutely. And Vtech had   such an incredible pioneering vision for this. I  mean, the stuff that Enjin did and has been doing  **9:53**still is just incredible, cutting edge. Again,  I have nothing but huge respect for those guys.**9:59**Ben Greenfield: Well, you've come a long way, baby,   because now you and I have conversations about the  EMF and blue light levels of VR headsets and how  **10:10**they could be heating and destroying tissue in the  brain. And so you've pivoted a little bit, man.**10:15**Caleb Applegate: I have pivoted a little bit. Look,   so blockchain has been a blast. I still kind  of dabble. And I sit on a board of a company  **10:25**called Passage that previously I was the  CEO of and another just incredible team.  **10:33**I love it. I think the principles behind  blockchain, governance, participation,  **10:41**bringing community together. An infinite ledger  of transaction history, immutability, trustless.  **10:48**I think so many principles that are embedded  in the DNA of blockchain, I just naturally  **10:56**gravitate towards. It's easy for me to talk  about what is money, who assigns it its value.**11:02**Caleb Applegate: The advent of bitcoin   introduced all sorts of, I think, very  critical, very compelling narratives,  **11:10**and we should be asking these questions. However,  you and I got together and started just talking  **11:17**about the world of health and wellness. And  this was really my own journey of having   some health issues and admittedly being a  little bit, just a little bit overweight.**11:28**Ben Greenfield: But you had an excuse for the   sector that you were working in. I mean, it's kind  of funny because, not to distract us too much,  **11:36**but River and Terran, my sons and I are headed  over to America's biggest gaming convention called  **11:42**Gen Con because my sons have started this card  game and board game business. And we were watching  **11:48**the instructional video for registration and  kind of like looking at videos of previous year's  **11:56**conferences and I warned them, I'm like, guys,  this is not going to be a fitness convention,   right? And not the stereotype. I'm going to offend  a lot of gamers. I'm sure. But I told them you  **12:05**guys are probably going to see a lot of giant  monster energy drinks, neck beards, piercings,  **12:12**goth makeup, giant oversized t-shirts, and people  playing Dungeons & Dragons and Catan until like  **12:19**3 a.m. under blue lights. Like, just be prepared  that this is the sector that we're venturing into.**12:25**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, no, it's true.   It's true. I think the background backend  principles of gaming, usability, engineering,  **12:39**what draws a person to use a product, that  type of conversation and kind of deep dive  **12:48**diligence is what I gravitate towards.  I want to know what makes people tick,   what they like, what they need, what's part of  their everyday rhythm, what makes them better.**13:01**Ben Greenfield: Now, since I brought you   on to Ben Greenfield Life, I'm just curious, what  has changed? I realize that's a loaded question  **13:10**as far as like your routine, what you've learned,  what big changes that you've made because you've  **13:15**transformed your body. I know that you're doing  a lot now as far as your own routine, what have  **13:22**been the biggest game changers for you in your  own routine, things that you've picked up here?**13:27**Caleb Applegate: Well, you've had   two guests on your podcast that made a huge  impact on me. Number one, Dallas Jenkins,  **13:35**who is a friend of yours, also a friend of  mine. Dallas was the original individual that  **13:44**got me into the film industry and helped  me out, introduced me to my entertainment  **13:50**attorney. And this is way back. This is  like 2000, I want to say 2007, maybe.**13:56**Ben Greenfield: By the way,   I'll link to that in the show notes.  Bengreenfieldlife.com/applegate is where the  **14:02**show notes are. Bengreenfieldlife.com/applegate,  Caleb's last name. But Dallas Jenkins, and I'll  **14:08**put that interview in there, he directed The  Chosen, which a lot of people are familiar with.**14:14**Caleb Applegate: Yep, he did. He's had an incredible journey,   but he gave some very practical, everyday habits  and disciplines that really spoke to me when I  **14:26**listened to that podcast. And I hadn't connected  with Dallas since he had done The Chosen,   it's been a while. But it was like, hey,  I can do this. This isn't actually that  **14:37**difficult. I can do this. Another gentleman  you had on your podcast was Michael Chernow,   Kreatures of Habit and his discipline stack.  I had to relisten to that over and over.**14:49**Caleb Applegate: I'm like, this guy has his shit together. He is   so dialed. I would say between those two and then  just being around you and just, you know, I don't  **15:02**want to be like the guy that looks like you just  ate a bag of Doritos. I want to actually, like,  **15:08**try to be better. And being around you, listening  to a few of, some of the guests that you've had  **15:15**on, I'm like, look, I've got to get serious  about this. On top of that, I have a wife who's,  **15:22**so I'm 6'3", she's 5'3", and she's a personal  trainer and loves homeopathy. Like, she has been  **15:29**the champion in our family, really pressing for  better health, better food, better environment,  **15:37**just all the way around, better ecosystem.  And I'm the guy that's been like, you know,   I have to work, I have to build, I have to create.**15:44**Caleb Applegate: I have to, you know,   make a better life for my family. All the  while, my own body is breaking down. And  **15:51**so I finally started listening to her who says,  look at these things and listen to what Ben is  **15:59**saying, like, do these things. So  I think it's been an amalgam of a   bunch of different variables that have been  very influential into my current routine.**16:09**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I get that   sometimes the spouse who says, you can't believe  how much money you've cost me after my significant  **16:17**other recommended the insert podcast here, the  Red Light podcast, the Toxic Mattress podcast,  **16:24**et cetera. So my apologies to folks who have  had their spouse introduce them to my podcast,  **16:31**but it's kind of funny. Caleb, a couple of  things came up for me as you were talking   about those podcasts that were a couple of  your favorites, the Dallas Jenkins show. I  **16:39**also learned a ton from that, one of the big  takeaways. And I don't know if you tried this,   he had debilitating low back pain. And one  of the recommendations that he gave on there,  **16:51**amongst a lot of really great recommendations for  low back pain, was to foam roll your butt. Foam  **16:56**roll your butt. And I started doing that more  intensively, like two or three times a week.**17:02**Ben Greenfield: And it is incredible   how if you kind of sit on a foam roller, you  kind of slap one leg on top of the other leg,  **17:08**and you start at the base of your knee and just  shimmy your body all the way up to your butt,   get up to your butt, weave back and forth, dig  into the tissue, then go back down to the knee,  **17:19**and you do that as about like ten passes or  so per side. And then I'll even lay myself  **17:24**on top of the foam roller and kind of like,  bring. This is difficult to describe an audio,   but I'm going to try it. I'll loop one  leg over the other leg and kind of like,  **17:33**crack the back on one side and then loop over the  other leg and crack the back on the other side.  **17:38**Not. That's an incredible move. Did you try any of  the butt foam rolling after listening to that one?**17:44**Caleb Applegate: Yeah. No, look, I didn't just   try it. I've been doing it every single day since  then. Um, that is the single biggest game changer,  **17:52**because a lot like Dallas, I, too, have lower  back pain. Or did. So I didn't just get a roller,  **17:59**though. I actually got one of those theragun  rollers where you can, like, create vibration.**18:05**Caleb Applegate: Oh, dude, game   changer. Love it. I do it every morning.  So my morning stack is a little bit of a  **18:12**blend of what Michael Chernow talked about and  Dallas talked about. So I start with rolling.  **18:18**So I'll do that a good, you know, 10, 15  minutes. And I do butt, legs, feet even.**18:25**Caleb Applegate: Then I'll jump into a workout,   usually 30 to 45 minutes. Oftentimes it's  walking or running or I do a lot of, like,  **18:34**peloton biking, which is really fun. And then I'll  jump into the sauna, do that for 25 to 30 minutes,  **18:40**hit the cold plunge. Thanks to our friends at  Morozko, I love their tub. And then have some  **18:49**quiet, meditative time, prayer time, and jump  into my workday. So even during the workouts,  **18:54**though, I'll be. I'm kind of addicted to work.  I love what I do, so I'm constantly just. Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I want to dig   into your ritual a little bit more. But you also  mentioned Michael Chernow, and apparently he went  **19:04**and flew down in high school with Lance Armstrong  in Texas. Recently, I just found out about this,   and Lance actually invested in that company  that Michael and I talked about on the show,  **19:13**the Kreatures of Habit Meal One. These little  done-for-you oatmeal packets. And I got some  **19:19**of those after the interview with him. What  I do is I soak them overnight in half-apple  **19:27**cider vinegar and half-water. And these are,  like, nostalgic flavors that you might remember   from Quaker oatmeal, if you're listening in.  Like, blueberry, and they got, like, a maple.**19:36**Ben Greenfield: It's fantastic. They   got chocolate. They got a vanilla apple cinnamon,  which is definitely nostalgic to the Quaker piece.  **19:43**You soak it overnight. These are glyphosate  free oats, and it makes, like, this kind of,   like, mushy pudding that I can use as a smoothie  filler that I can use for dessert. Like, a lot of  **19:54**times my dessert is yogurt with dark chocolate and  berries. But sometimes I'll put a spoonful of that   Meal One in there. And for travel, it's incredible  because you got these packets, you mix them up,  **20:05**you know, hotel room, you don't want to go  down to the nasty continental breakfast. Ben Greenfield: I'll even, I don't   know if I told you this, Caleb. I'll surf to  the airport. I go up to Starbucks when I want  **20:13**to have a meal in the airport because I always  have a couple of the Meal One packets in my bag,  **20:18**and I asked them what I say so I can get free  hot water because some of these basketballs will  **20:24**charge, like, $0.75 for hot water. As I say, it's  not technically a lie, but I say I have oatmeal,  **20:31**but I forgot to get hot water. Do you have hot  water in a spoon that you can give me in a cup?  **20:37**I'm sure they think I probably got the oatmeal  at Starbucks, and we're gonna get hot water at   Starbucks. But anyways, they graciously give me  the hot water, the spoon, I mix up the oatmeal,  **20:46**and this is like, you know, usually as I'm  walking to my gate, by the time I get to my gate,   it's soaked in that hot water. It's nice,  it's mushy, and I can have a meal if I'm  **20:54**traveling. And even though I often fast when I  travel, some of these longer bouts, you know,   if I've worked out in the morning, whatever,  I want some to, some to crush, it's healthy.**21:03**Ben Greenfield: So the Meal One, I'm glad you brought it up,   because that's been a winner, and it stops for  me. I got a whole pantry full of those things.**21:10**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, same. I have it   five days a week. Uh, typically, we do something  else on the weekends because we're together as a  **21:17**family, but during the week, again, game  changers. Super practical in a packet,  **21:23**and I'm moving so quick on, you know, just,  uh, in my routine in the mornings because  **21:29**I've got so much on my plate for the day,  so I've got to be ultra disciplined, like,   down to the minute. So its really  nice to just take that packet,  **21:36**dump it in. I take some walnut halves, throw it  in. I love putting the Kion colostrum into that.**21:44**Caleb Applegate: I mean, it just makes   it milky and smooth and so good. Put  some water in, maybe cut up a banana  **21:51**and a pinch of colima salt. I dont know  if youve done that. So good, man. So good.**21:57**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, its incredible. This is   turning a giant commercial for Kreatures of Habit.  But one more tip is when you soak it overnight,  **22:03**even though it's got, like, pumpkin seeds  and chia seeds, got all this stuff in it,   you put a few scoopfuls of chia seeds in  there, and it turns into, like, this thick,  **22:11**gelatinous pudding. So you can make it  even thicker with the addition of chia   seeds before you do the overnight soak. So  you gotta try that one if you haven't yet.**22:18**Caleb Applegate: As it turns out,   man, you and I are foodies.  We like to eat good food. Ben Greenfield: I know, I know.  **22:24**How has your diet actually changed since you  started? Kind of like, soaking up a lot more   from Ben Greenfield life and working behind the  scenes, you know, chatting with partners, like,  **22:34**you know, Kreatures of Habit or whatever  else, getting your hands on a lot of this   stuff. I'm just curious how it's evolved,  because, well, I mean, I'll open the kimono  **22:42**on this a little bit. You know, the town that  you and I kind of originate from and met in is  **22:49**a town that has a very kind of, like. It's  like a large reformed protestant community,  **22:56**the church that you and I attended. But  it's very much like giant Sabbath feasts   and cigar and whiskey. And it's not necessarily  focused that much on healthy diets, per se.**23:07**Ben Greenfield: I was a part of that   culture. I know you were. But I'm just  curious how it's changed from kind of  **23:12**like that general mentality to being a little  bit more aware of your nutrients in your diet.**23:19**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, well, look, you   are right. The community and culture that we've  been a part of is rich and beautiful and glorious  **23:28**and just eat the fat, really lean in and enjoy  God's bounty. I think for me personally, because  **23:38**every body type is different, being more aware  of what I'm putting into my body. In other words,  **23:45**you know, I have a propensity to like sugar  and sweets. You know, cheesecake is probably  **23:54**one of the biggest things that I've, at  least recently been, having to navigate.**23:59**Ben Greenfield: Especially, by the way,   at my mom's coffee shop that you alluded  to, they had pretty hefty cheesecake there.**24:05**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, 100%. And so I just. It's discipline,   right? I don't say no. I say sometimes, and I try  to work for it. One of the tips that you gave me,  **24:16**and this has been also a game changer. I was  actually sharing this with some folks at a new gym  **24:22**that I joined yesterday. And that is like going  to bed hungry, right? It's okay to be hungry.  **24:30**Right before the opposite of that was, I'm eating  so much that I'm constantly full. I feel bloated,  **24:38**I feel heavy, I feel thick. Going on a walk after  dinner, and I'm just like, this is miserable.**24:44**Caleb Applegate: The opposite of that   is eat just enough, portion out what you need.  Really. What is it that you need? That's the  **24:50**question that I've been asking myself. And the  feeling of being satisfied and then turning into  **24:57**that hungry state right before bed, it feels at  first you're like, man, I want to go snack or  **25:05**something. But if you hold the line, you feel  so much better. And your mind is clearer, too.**25:12**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, there's a certain character   developing, stoic, shut up, the inner bitch type  of mentality that's involved with going to bed  **25:22**hungry. But it's kind of funny, because before you  moved down to Moscow, you and I used to have a lot  **25:28**of these conversations over dinner, and I haven't  even filled you in on this yet, but now I think   you can have your cake and eat it, too. So I'll  tell you why. You know our mutual friend Martin,  **25:36**who you're doing the Shark Tank Panel with at  the Health Optimization Summit. Martin Tobias. Caleb Applegate: Love Martin. Yep.**25:42**Ben Greenfield: Okay. I don't remember   if you were at this dinner. We were down at  Lodgepole in Moscow. Let me know if this.  **25:48**If this jogs your memory or if you weren't at  this dinner. And Martin, who's also a foodie,  **25:53**he comes in, and I'd already ordered up,  like, five killer appetizers. It was, like,   pork belly and deviled eggs and these beautiful  salads. And, you know, they're wonderful.**26:04**Ben Greenfield: You know, fresh   baked warm bread with the butter there.  They put all sorts of herbs into. And  **26:09**Martin ponies up. He sits down, and I'm  watching. During the whole dinner, he has,  **26:15**like, a couple of glasses of water and half  of one of the deviled eggs. And he's like,  **26:21**I'm just not hungry. He's like, I can't eat. And  it turns out that he had started onto a zemp, the  **26:27**GLP-1 agonist, to try it out. Hopefully, I'm not  outing Martin on this show. My apologies, Martin.**26:33**Caleb Applegate: We were there. I remember this. Ben Greenfield: Yeah, okay. You were   there. He couldn't. He was nauseous. And that was  when I first started thinking about GLP-1. Now,  **26:41**long story short, since then, I've written  a lot of articles and done podcasts and some   of the dangers of long-term use of that peptide.  But the mechanism of action is to increase GLP-1  **26:52**to GLP-1 agonists, as the name implies. And that  makes you feel full. Well, since then I've been  **26:59**looking at other agents that could act similarly  that give you the same release of satiety-inducing  **27:05**hormones. There's three of them, namely GLP, one  called CCK, one called PYY. Turns out that you  **27:14**can consume certain compounds that make you feel  full and satiated, meaning you can eat less for  **27:21**say dinner or lunch if that's your vice, go to  bed, feel satisfied, but also you've eaten less.**27:31**Ben Greenfield: And two of the most powerful things   I've found besides ketone. I used to use ketones  for this for a long time, like the drinkable  **27:37**ketone esters. And now the two things are, you can  increase GLP-1 production and appetite-regulating  **27:47**hormones via your microbiome. This company called  Pendulum, they've been sponsored the podcast in  **27:53**the past. They have a probiotics called the GLP-1  probiotic. And again, I don't remember if I've  **27:59**told you about these two, Caleb, but you take it  when you wake up in the morning and it stabilizes  **28:04**your appetite throughout the day. It's acromantia,  albutericum and lactobacillus probiotic blended  **28:10**together. So that's one strategy, but  then the second one is even more powerful.**28:15**Ben Greenfield: So if you can trigger the   bitter receptors in your small intestine, then  you don't get hungry. The problem is the amount  **28:24**of bitterness that it takes to do that is highly  unpalatable. Like a lot of people will say, oh,  **28:30**use apple cider vinegar or the peels of certain  citrus fruits or bitter meal and extract or  **28:35**whatever. None of those are bitter enough to make  you full. They're bitter enough to decrease your  **28:40**blood glucose response to a meal, but not to make  you full. So there is an extract of hops, the same  **28:47**stuff that you would use to make beer. And this  company in New Zealand, they figured out how to  **28:53**extract it. It's a compound called amasarate, and  they put the capsule in a little lipid medium.**29:03**Ben Greenfield: You swallow it, it goes through your stomach   intact, it opens up in your small intestine, hits  all the bitter receptors without you having to  **29:11**taste it on your tongue because you literally like  puke, it's so bitter. And your fullness, if you  **29:16**do this, say like a couple of capsules an hour  before lunch, a couple capsules an hour before   dinner. Again, you don't. It's almost dangerous  because you want to enjoy your meal and you still  **29:27**enjoy it a little bit. But you don't think about  food. You go to bed, super full. It's almost,  **29:32**you know, you got to warn people, hey, be careful  not to lose too much weight, lose too much muscle,   etcetera. But those two are incredible. If,  you know, if you like me or a foodie and just  **29:43**go to bed thinking about food, you got to try  at least one or both of those at some point.**29:49**Caleb Applegate: Good to know.   Yeah. There's so many, I think, different  things to try here, and for me right now,  **30:00**I'm just trying to develop mental clarity  and discipline. I think it starts there.  **30:06**If I can change my mindset on things, to me  that's the biggest thing. And I have found  **30:12**personally that that's the biggest  obstacle out of the gate to conquer.**30:17**Ben Greenfield: Yeah. This is something I wanted   to ask you about because I know you've thought  about this a lot, coming from your background  **30:23**in gamification, in even community building and  accountability. What do you think is the biggest  **30:31**barrier? People who are listening in and they've  already heard about foam rolling your butt and   soaking oatmeal and chia seeds and taking a  GLP-1 agonist mimicking device and exogenous  **30:41**ketones and the Morozko cold plunge. What do you  think is the biggest barrier for people who are  **30:48**tuning into podcasts like this and just getting  dizzy in terms of the advice on how to implement?**30:54**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, it's a great   question. And I would say, and this is  just me speaking personally for myself  **30:59**and my family. It's information overload.  Like, where do you begin? What is it? Okay,  **31:06**this is the information. Why should I care? Where  does it intersect with my personal values and  **31:13**how I want to orient my life and how. And how I  think most people get tripped up because there's  **31:19**a lot of information out there. There's a lot of  influencers, brands and products and services,  **31:26**and where do you even begin? Right. It is,  it's just information complete overload.**31:34**Ben Greenfield: Guilty as charged.   So how do you think about the  information overload solution then?**31:42**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, I mean, this is just, again, personally   anecdotal. We have been walking this journey with  the Greenfield family and with a few other key  **31:53**folks like our good friend Dr. Leland Stillman,  who's been tremendous in my family's life. And  **32:00**through this process, we recognize that; a, we can  do better, b, there's a good chunk of information,  **32:12**c, how do you activate it? I think for our family,  the how has been a bit nebulous at times. It isn't  **32:22**always solvable by just changing up a supplement  or eating at different times or eating different  **32:30**portions. There are so many different variables.  And so I think this is like really good lead in to  **32:36**talk about the advent of what you and I have  been kind of concocting, creating, building,  **32:43**crafting in the background to solve these  types of problems for everyday folks like us.**32:52**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, yeah, I want to talk   about that for sure. But I don't want to leave  behind one thing. You mentioned Dr. Stillman.  **32:57**He's been on the show before. He's a genius when  it comes to the type of testing that he does,   and then the replenishment program that you start  on afterwards. What'd you learn from him? Or was  **33:08**there anything you found out about your body  that you changed after working with Leland? Caleb Applegate: Yeah. One thing that I really  **33:14**respect about Dr. Stillman is just that he's calm,  he's collected, and he doesn't panic. Right. You  **33:22**might have an issue or you might think you're  dying. He's like, no, you're not. And here's what  **33:28**we need to do. And I like that calm, disciplined,  sober-minded leadership. So it isn't just applying  **33:36**medical prowess or information that he has,  it's also his guidance through the process.**33:43**Caleb Applegate: And so I think   what he and I have talked about over the  past several years, or couple of years,  **33:51**is just how to make the process easier for  everyday folks. What do I mean by that?  **34:00**Everyone is bio custom individual. You might see  a great advertisement for the latest supplement  **34:08**package. Doesn't mean that you need that  though. And I think that's something I've   come to learn. Some products look incredibly  sexy and I want to try this and it's awesome.**34:18**Ben Greenfield: It does mean you need it if your neighbor   or your favorite biohacker or transhumanist is  taking it to live to 160, it must be, right?**34:26**Caleb Applegate: Exactly. But I think what   working with Dr. Stillman has shown me is that  that isn't always the case. Everybody's different.  **34:35**Every body is different. And so using that as  your starting point and going what's your body  **34:42**telling you? What data can we extract from, say a  Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis? You might have heavy  **34:51**metals that's creating toxicity in your body.  You might be deficient. You and I, Ben, we live  **34:57**in the Pacific Northwest, which means we might  not get as much vitamin D as someone that lives   down in Arizona, right? So there are variables  and factors that play into this. And so as  **35:08**this bio custom outlook kind of takes shape, it's  important to know that it's not one size fits all.**35:17**Caleb Applegate: And that's been a game   changer in our family because we would just go  with the typical supplements protocol or typical,  **35:26**hey, this influencer says we need this. Turns  out our chemistry might not actually need that.**35:33**Ben Greenfield: The HTMA, the Hair   Tissue Mineral Analysis that you mentioned.  I actually really like that. It's a perfect  **35:39**example of what you're talking about, right? It's  like 100, maybe a little bit more, dollar test.  **35:45**You get it. And a lot of people are like, well,  it only tells me minerals and toxins. It doesn't   tell me everything else, but everything from your  copper to your zinc ratios to your sodium levels,  **35:54**potassium levels, indicators of sympathetic  and parasympathetic nervous system balance.  **35:59**There is a ton that you can glean from  that one test. I actually took Leland's  **36:04**entire HTMA course to learn how to interpret  it better and just learned that, oh my gosh,   this is more than just like a simple hair  test for metals and toxins and minerals.**36:13**Ben Greenfield: Like, it goes pretty deep.   And it is kind of cool how even though you can do  like, I've interviewed the folks from Wild Health,  **36:21**the fancy multi-thousand dollar executive  panel and the full body mris and the full   genome analysis and the metabolomics report for  fatty acids and amino acids and micronutrients  **36:32**and all these things that you can do that  we, and certainly people like Dr. Stillman  **36:38**walk people through. The HTMA is a perfect  example of taking the seemingly complex world  **36:45**of self-quantification and at least trying  to introduce some amount of simplicity to it. Caleb Applegate: 100%. It gives you a baseline to build  **36:52**off of data is important. It's really important.  And I would say that data without overload is a  **37:02**great starting point. Just show me the basics  that explain how I'm feeling, maybe why I'm  **37:09**feeling a certain way, so that we can quickly get  into the how. How do we start to solve for this?**37:16**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I mean, I know that you. It's kind   of interesting because you're unique. I may call  you an Avatar, Caleb, even though you're not blue,  **37:24**your unique avatar in that. You know, I met you  when you were really wanting to be healthier.  **37:33**You're super interested in a lot of the biohacks  that I was talking about. And for a lot of people,  **37:39**it is not to kick that live to 160 horse to death,  but it's not about bragging rights for living the  **37:45**longest time or owning the half-million dollars  worth of biohacks or whatever. It's more about  **37:53**having more productivity being unleashed to create  more wealth, having time available and left over  **38:01**after your fitness and your self-preservation  efforts for family and hobbies and career and  **38:08**social life, etc. And so, you know, I would  love to hear how you kind of, you know, in your  **38:16**situation, think about or thought about or began  to tackle this issue that you kind of ran into.**38:22**Ben Greenfield: At least I think   this is the way you kind of explained  to me, like, just knowing me, you know,   as my friend, you get bombarded with a lot  of information. Then once you came on at Ben  **38:31**Greenfield Life is just more information through  the firehose of health. And, you know, you kind  **38:39**of came up with some solutions or potential ways  to reduce some of that complexity and confusion.**38:46**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, you're absolutely right. And again,   so much of what you and I have talked about has  been anecdotal. This is me personally, my family,  **38:55**and our personal journey. And part of the issues  that we've hit up against time and time again is;  **39:03**a, there's a ton of information out there,  b, what do you do with it? And does all of  **39:09**it pertain to you? Right. You might see really  cool supplements, but they may not be for your  **39:17**bio custom individual self. And every body  is different, as we said earlier. So it's  **39:23**sifting through all the noise. There's a  lot of noise, but it doesn't stop there.**39:28**Caleb Applegate: Let's say you get down   a path with a functional medicine doctor. How do  you know if it's working? You started taking those  **39:35**supplements. Do you feel better? Is it placebo?  Are you really starting to see change? There's new  **39:41**and different ideas and opinions and things that  are always surfacing. Right. Who do you listen to?**39:48**Ben Greenfield: Right? Or worse yet, by the way,   because I run into this a lot, you listen to like  20 different podcasts, and you've woven through  **39:56**maybe like four or five different doctors, and  you've got like four shells in your pantry of  **40:03**all the supplements and creams and lotions and  transdermals that you started on with one person  **40:08**or heard about on a podcast, and now you just  kind of almost like, dizzy when you walk into   your pantry or open your refrigerator trying to  figure out what to take and what's right for you.**40:19**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, exactly. And the thing that you   and I have discussed a ton through this process  of my journey, my family's journey, is if that's  **40:29**happening with us, we can surely assume that it's  happening with a lot of other folks out there. And  **40:36**so as you and I started thinking through, not just  the problems, but what could potential solutions  **40:44**look like. We've, from the outset, been thinking  about what we're coining as the every person.  **40:52**Right. We think about the folks who are busy  running their kids back and forth from school  **40:58**and husbands going to work and trying to build a  career. We're not just talking about, you know,  **41:05**the elites, the top tier class A executives.  We're talking about folks, just everyday folks,  **41:12**who know something is off. We're trying to figure  out easy solutions for that group of folks.**41:21**Ben Greenfield: Yeah, it's a really good point too,   because I get this a lot. People come up to me at  conferences or at events and they're like, well,  **41:27**I want to get healthy, but I'm not as extreme  as you. Or they think the person I'm talking  **41:33**to is the elite biohacker or they have to sign  up for some super duper, admittedly expensive  **41:40**private VIP coaching program with me in order to  get healthy. And that's one thing that you and I  **41:46**have been talking about just the past few months  is I've created journeys and transformations, but  **41:53**they're expensive and they're one-on-one and you  got to sign up to work with me. And furthermore,  **41:59**like I don't even work with more than ten people  in a month, but yet we have all this information,  **42:06**all this content, all these connections, all  these vetted and curated companies and products,  **42:14**all of these, all this information. But you're a  way better architect than me, Caleb. Cause for me,  **42:23**you walk into my office, it's not exactly  clean, but I kind of know where everything is.   Whereas you're good at kind of  architecting a journey for someone,  **42:32**to so-called transformation or something, that  they might be seeking in the world of health.**42:38**Ben Greenfield: So when you presented   to me the idea of the next evolution of Ben  Greenfield Life, I was actually pretty excited  **42:48**about it. But I'd love for you to share in  your own words what you were kind of like   laying awake thinking about at night and then,  you know, voxering me about in the mornings.**42:58**Caleb Applegate: Well, you are correct.   You are the mad scientist, right? I go into your  zen den and you've got the coolest gadgets on the  **43:06**planet and they're all, like, incredible in their  own right. The question that you and I have been  **43:12**wrestling with is how do we take that and somehow  make that or a version of that or information,  **43:19**the science behind that available to all people.  And so yeah, we really started transitioning to  **43:28**what if. What if there was a place, one place,  not walled gardens everywhere, which you see in  **43:35**a lot of different spaces, especially in the  health and wellness space. What if there was   one house with lots of different rooms? Rooms  with the best products, the best curated core  **43:47**contributing experts in their various fields,  all in that health and wellness space. What  **43:54**if they could offer their services? And what  if you could build community around that? So,  **43:59**in essence, what if it was the public square  of all things transformation geared for you  **44:07**and for your desired health transformation  outcomes. Like, this is a game changer.**44:12**Caleb Applegate: And this was the thing that I think   you and I together identified early on is that  that didn't really exist. And the what if became,  **44:22**well, let's build it. Let's start putting  the pieces together. Where do we begin? And  **44:27**that's where the architecture really came  into place. But you've built a lifetime of  **44:33**incredible relationships. You've tried some  of the coolest gear on the planet, really.  **44:38**My job is just now building the architecture  that connects it all and threads the needle. Ben Greenfield: Early on, we were talking about podcasts,  **44:46**right? There's maybe somebody subscribes like  15 different health podcasts. So you have all   this information flying out there. It's not  structured. You don't know exactly what to do  **44:55**with it. But you have this information jumbling  around inside your head, and you're grabbing a   little bit here and a little bit there, and maybe  have a few friends who are doing the same thing,  **45:04**but they might listen to a few different podcasts  and have their own approach. And then from a book  **45:09**standpoint, you've got something like Boundless,  right, which you referred to as the Bible earlier   in the podcast. Well, that's also kind of  a cookbook full of a lot of information,  **45:19**but you don't necessarily open it, take your  finger, point, click, and all of a sudden be  **45:24**able to have a program designed for you that  leaps out from the, say, the sleep chapter or  **45:32**the hormones chapter or the longevity chapter.  And so what got me excited when I was talking  **45:38**to you early on in this process of what do we  do with all this information to actually make  **45:43**it accessible in a way that allows to someone,  that allows someone to actually time hack this,  **45:50**transform themselves, but also kind of like,  have all these experts in your back pocket,  **45:55**like, actually accessible to you to be able  to be like, hey, Ben, I have a question. Ben Greenfield: Hey, you know, I'm going to hop on the Wednesday  **46:01**AMA and ask Ben this, and it correlates directly  to the program that's been created for me that me  **46:07**and other members of a community are following to,  say, optimize sleep, or optimize hormones or lose  **46:13**fat or we're on a, you know, a transformation  challenge this month for, say, buttery hips and  **46:21**mobility, or whatever the case may be. So we threw  around a few ideas, but I don't remember which one  **46:30**of us or a team member or whatever came up with  the idea of, like, a network? We bandied about a  **46:38**few terms, but really what we've settled on is  this idea of a life network, right? All things  **46:46**life optimization within one network that's not  expensive, that consolidates all this information,  **46:55**that gives you access to your favorite experts  and also gives you a roadmap to follow and a  **47:01**community to support you and have fun with  you along that journey of transformation.**47:08**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, no, beautifully   said. Here's the thing. I've spent years  and years and years designing products,  **47:15**experiences using gamification, really  digging into usability, engineering this  **47:21**next chapter of my life together with you and  the tremendous team at Ben Greenfield Life.  **47:28**We want to help you design your outcomes,  design your transformation outcomes. This  **47:34**is about you and your journey. Again, so much  of this was anecdotal for me and my family,  **47:40**right? I ignored, ignored, ignored. Now I'm  like information overload. How do I distill  **47:47**it and create act real action orientation around  it? Not just I'm going to get a gym membership,  **47:54**not just I'm going to try to get a little bit  more sleep or that's a cool supplement over there.**48:00**Caleb Applegate: We want you to connect with things that are going   to create real, lasting, both short and long-term  true transformation. So it's, yeah, Life Network  **48:10**is, I think, it's the future. I think it takes the  power of data tracking with wearables and a lot  **48:18**of the cool products that are out there. And it  also lets us, like, that's a foundational building  **48:23**block. It allows us to use that data coupled with  real community data points. Like, how did you  **48:32**participated in a challenge? You did that workout.  Who's tracking that? And one of the beautiful  **48:38**things with Life Network is that we emphasize four  key things: mind, body, spirit, and community.**48:46**Caleb Applegate: These are the things that we've identified   as our core pillars. What if you could have, this  goes back to the what if, right? What if you could  **48:54**have a life performance score, more holistic view?  Not just how you slept or your HRV, but looking  **49:03**at the whole picture of things. So really, life  network becomes a health tracking concierge team.**49:11**Ben Greenfield: I'm doing it right now,   by the way, Caleb, I'm wearing the Life Network  branded ultra human ring. I think you have one,  **49:17**too. Yeah, that's just like a sneak peek.  If people are watching the video, it's at  **49:22**bengreenfieldlife.com/applegate. Literally, blood  glucose, sleep, blood and biomarkers, activity,  **49:29**HRV, meditation sessions, breath work, coaching,  all built into one beautiful curated ring,  **49:36**right? That's available to our members. Rinse,  wash, and repeat that with your sauna and cold  **49:42**plunge package, with your home environmental  optimization package, etc. And it's kind of funny,  **49:47**Caleb, because, well, inside baseball for folks,  we have these really fun annual Ben Greenfield  **49:55**Life team retreats where we bring the whole team  together. And I crafted a vision two years ago  **50:02**at the team retreat in which I described how,  probably because I'm kind of like a content  **50:07**junkie and autodidact, I love to digest all this  information from the healthosphere and then turn   around and figure out a way to package  that and make it palatable for people.**50:17**Ben Greenfield: I architect, or I describe the   vision of like a podcast network, right? What if  we took what we've done with me and then we have,  **50:27**you know, we're generating revenue from ads,  but we've got the mommy endurance runner,  **50:34**and the swimmer, and the weightlifter, and  the biohacker, and the nutrition junkie, etc.,  **50:41**etc. And that was kind of sort of a cool idea. But  you really showed me that people don't need just a  **50:51**bunch more content, right? They need an actual  journey, and they need it structured in such  **50:57**a way that they actually have a plan to follow.  And yet, I actually am excited about the content  **51:05**part of the Life Network, too, because we have  taken this idea of podcasters, albeit ad free,  **51:13**hooray, within the Life Network. But tell me  about the idea of the actual content in there,  **51:18**especially like the podcast, AMA,  audio, video, learning type of stuff.**51:24**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, I think you hit on some really important   things here. One thing that I will highlight is  the thing that I'm the most excited about is,  **51:34**to your point, what do you do with all this  information? What our family needed, what I needed  **51:40**was movement. Constant movement. Forward, one step  at a time. Movement. In community. And then how do  **51:49**you take that information to make better informed  decisions about yourself, your health patterns,  **51:55**and then how can you contribute back into  the community? It's a beautiful flywheel,   actually. When we look at the content inside of  Life Network, it has a communal aspect to it.  **52:07**It's very dynamic. Instead of I'm reading this and  it's transactional, here's what I mean by that.**52:13**Caleb Applegate: You don't just jump into Life Network and you're   met with a bunch of different articles or some  of Ben's beautifully produced, epic masterclass  **52:24**course content. It is that, but it's so much more.  You mentioned shows, so we have a show, a weekly  **52:31**show called Triumph Weekly. This is the summary  of all things happening on the network. Everything  **52:38**from, we've got this VIP cooking event coming  up. Members only. There's 50 spots, this Friday.**52:46**Caleb Applegate: Make sure you don't forget   to join. Set your timer and be first in line.  We've got different core-contributing experts  **52:55**that we'll bring onto the Triumph Weekly Show. And  this is only like a 10 to 15 minutes show. Think   of it like a news anchor. Kind of like, here's all  things happening in the networks. Because it's a  **53:04**community. We want to celebrate wins. We want  to highlight achievements. Even if you didn't  **53:12**win a challenge, the fact that you participated,  you just got there is a win in and of itself. We  **53:21**will have challenges. We'll have different  shows. We have our new team, Team Triumph.**53:27**Ben Greenfield: RAW. We have RAW. Caleb Applegate: Right? Right. Go   ahead. You talk about RAW. This is your thing.**53:34**Ben Greenfield: Okay, I'll talk about   Rob. By the way, you were mentioning  Team Triumph. Many of you were on the  **53:39**ladder platform where you're following my  workouts. For those of you who missed that,   that's all going to be in Life Network now  as part of Team Triumph. So you get your  **53:50**daily workouts. I'll let Caleb and a little bit  tell you about the super slick interface. Like,   we have not messed around as far as the interface  goes and the usability. But part of this,  **54:00**too is like, I have thoughts sometimes when I'm  interviewing a guest, I only have so much time.**54:07**Ben Greenfield: Typically there's an hour to an hour and 15   minutes allotted for me to interview somebody. I  often keep my mouth shut when I disagree or when I  **54:17**want to argue back at a point. I often have things  I want to share post-show that are on my mind that  **54:24**I don't get a chance to share just cause there's  only so much time in the day. And a lot of times I   have things that I know I want the guests to talk  about that we just don't have time to get to. If  **54:33**I'm constantly interrupting them and arguing and  pushing back and sharing my own thoughts, etc.   You guys listen to the podcast, you probably hear  that I try not to talk over the guests too much.**54:43**Ben Greenfield: I also have things that   I want to talk about that go way beyond the twice  monthly Q&A's that I do like. Tons of tips from,  **54:53**gosh, the RAW episodes or everything from things  I'm doing for big toe and low back mobility, to  **55:00**new family and relationship habits, to different  ways I've been tapping into some of the appetite  **55:07**control stuff Caleb and I were talking about  earlier. I wanted an ad free platform where I  **55:14**could just talk to you like you and me having  a phone conversation where, hey, here's the. I   actually have some clients who will do this to me.  Like, they'll pay for a consultation and they'll  **55:23**lead off the consultation with. So, Ben, tell  me what you haven't been talking about in the   podcast. Tell me about the new things you've  discovered lately that are working for you.**55:32**Ben Greenfield: And basically, like my podcast and the Life   Network, the RAW show, is just that. It's quick,  it's edgy, it's me. It's like 30 minutes long,  **55:43**and it's literally just my chance to, to share  the stuff that I just don't get a chance to   share with you on this normal podcast feed, the  one you're listening to right now, in an ad free  **55:53**environment with the ability for you to be able  to interact with me within that environment.  **55:59**We're talking like AMA's forums, not just me,  but the other experts within the platform.  **56:04**I'm pretty excited about The RAW Podcast,  Caleb. It's been fun to record the first few. Caleb Applegate: I know, and you're crushing it. It's  **56:11**amazing because you're right. You have so much in  your orbit that's happening. All the crazy stuff  **56:17**that you get introduced to, the people that you  get to meet. I'm personally really excited about  **56:23**RAW with Ben Greenfield because it is, it's like  meeting Oz behind the curtain. So it's going to be  **56:29**super fun. So we've got RAW, we've got Triumph  Weekly. We've got several other shows that are  **56:36**already in production that will launch post-MVP of  Life Network, which we are hoping for-August ish.  **56:45**Around that timeline, we'll be doing a friends  and family release of that. We also, Team Triumph,  **56:52**like you mentioned. But this is the biggest thing  I think I'm the most excited about. We're going  **56:57**to be hosting debates. Do you want to talk for  a minute about this? Because this was really,  **57:03**this was your brainchild, and I know we've  kind of ideated together, but this is so cool.**57:10**Ben Greenfield: Okay, so this is something.   It's kind of like herding cats for me. But I've  got some really good debates that I'm going to be  **57:19**moderating. I got Sean Baker and Joel Green doing  carnivore versus omnivore. I have a doctor who  **57:26**hates stem cells debating a doctor who is super  into stem cells. I'm doing seed oils are bad  **57:33**versus seed oils are good. Just about, you know,  keto versus, you know, a high carb diet is better  **57:40**for the thyroid and for metabolism, anything  that you've heard on two different podcasts  **57:46**and you wish those people would just step into  like celebrity death match and go at each other.**57:52**Ben Greenfield: We're doing that within   the Life's Network. So basically juicy, juicy  debates on all the topics related to health,  **58:01**nutrition, fitness, biohacking. So  that's kind of another cool feature. Caleb Applegate: Yeah, 100%. And there is  **58:09**no other platform that's going to spotlight  conversation like this. Like X is great,  **58:16**but it's such a generalized public square. What  we're aiming to create here is a safe place  **58:25**around health, wellness and life optimization. So  conversation movements in community, we're here  **58:31**together. And then you and I, it doesn't just  stop there. We have really exciting plans to  **58:36**take this digital environment and kind of touch it  down locally, practically. So lots of cool stuff.**58:42**Caleb Applegate: We'll have our own   merchandise line that we're dropping with some  really epic, like Triumph t-shirts. We've got,  **58:49**I mean, the list goes on and on. I cannot wait  for the public to see this and experience it. The  **58:55**other thing that I want to highlight here, because  we've talked about, what are some of the cool  **59:00**things inside the Network. But one of the biggest  things that just to be transparent for a minute,  **59:09**that you and I have talked about is making  this accessible and affordable for everybody,  **59:15**right? Looking at the health and wellness space,  there's some just incredible products out there.  **59:21**Our desire, though, and I think our family's  desire, is to make sure that every person on  **59:29**the planet has access to this. Which means it  needs to be ultra affordable, right? We have  **59:37**operating costs, there's a baseline fee, but we've  put this thing at 16.99 a month. 16.99 a month.**59:44**Ben Greenfield: $16. Not 1,699. $16.99.**59:50**Caleb Applegate: That's exactly   right. Which is a game changer. It  doesn't exist in this space. Right?**59:56**Ben Greenfield: And look, by the way,   folks, I kind of like, let's not beat around  the bush. I own Ben Greenfield Life. It's how  **1:00:03**I feed my family. And when Caleb came to me, he's  like, we can do this at $16.99 a month. I'm like,  **1:00:10**oh, I don't know if we're going to actually  generate any meaningful revenue from that,  **1:00:18**but it's really about a lot of people in the  community. We want to build a massive tribe  **1:00:26**and a network. And sure there's things within  the Life Network. Like if you join for $16.99,  **1:00:32**you're not going to get like the $400 ring, right?  Like we make certain things accessible within  **1:00:37**the Life Network that you then get access to as a  member that you can't get unless you're a member.**1:00:42**Ben Greenfield: But all the content,   all the podcasts, all the debates, all the  community, all the Team Triumph workouts,  **1:00:49**all of the forums, everything is $16.99 a month.**1:00:55**Caleb Applegate: Yeah. It is your one-stop home,   your family, your community of like minded  individuals who are wanting the exact same  **1:01:05**thing. And that is to feel better and take that  desire and contribute back into the community.  **1:01:12**Pour back into the community. Somebody asked  me, or I've been asked several times recently,  **1:01:19**what are you expecting in terms of  users? And this is really important,   and I do feel compelled to share this. I've  said this over and over and over again. If we  **1:01:30**get 50 people out of the gate, I want to make  sure those 50 people are loved on so much and  **1:01:38**that they are experiencing real outcomes and feel  valued, that they want to tell 50 other people,  **1:01:46**so on and so forth. Our goal is to make this  boutique experience be the best, most world class  **1:01:55**experience on the planet, where you're not just  getting information, but you're getting engaged.**1:02:02**Ben Greenfield: Yeah. Yeah. And it's consolidated   and curated. I want to tell a story to drive  my point home. When I first started my podcast,  **1:02:10**this was like 17 years ago, right? This was before  River and Terran were born. That I was this,  **1:02:15**you know, freckle-faced personal trainer with a,  af you go back and find episode one, super high  **1:02:22**pitched voice, you know, skinny kids sitting in  the gym, opening up my age old computer with the  **1:02:32**computer camera turned on, talking into the camera  and like, thumbing through strength conditioning   journals and research. It was like 17 episodes  in when I interviewed my first official guest.**1:02:43**Ben Greenfield: I think it was Angela   Nath. Shout out to Angela. I think she  still listens to the show. Professional   cyclist and triathlete. There was maybe like  Gillian Michaels, Dave Asprey, Rob Wolf.  **1:02:56**I think Joe Rogan had a podcast. I don't remember,  but there were less than 100 podcasts, period.  **1:03:03**This is where you had to hard code your RSS feed  to Apple, wait two weeks for it to get accepted.**1:03:10**Ben Greenfield: If it was over something stupid,   like 100 megabytes, if any line of code was messed  up, your podcast would disappear. And this was  **1:03:20**like the dinosaur days of podcasting.  Well, kind of like blogging, you know,  **1:03:25**in the way that blogging transformed from the late  90s to the mid 2000s, you know, podcasting from  **1:03:31**the early 2000s to present day. Even if you just  talk about, like, health and fitness, podcasts  **1:03:37**has absolutely blown up. There are thousands  and thousands of podcasts which means a stream  **1:03:45**of information that you could listen to all day  long at 4x speed that you still would not be able  **1:03:52**to get through listening 7 days a week. So one of  the ways I think about the Life Network is what if  **1:04:00**it was all consolidated and curated, and all you  had to do was open the Life Network and just have  **1:04:05**those podcasts? Like, that's all the information  you need. We split it. Mind, body, spirit.**1:04:11**Ben Greenfield: You've got all the advice you need. I'm looking   over everything. I'm vetting all the guests,  I'm vetting all the experts. It's an ad free  **1:04:18**environment. Yeah, I mean, I don't want to shoot  myself in the foot here. You're still going to get   a lot of value out of this podcast that you're  listening to right now. But imagine if you were  **1:04:26**listening to this podcast. Let's say something  about, I don't know, haptic therapy for sleep.**1:04:32**Ben Greenfield: And you could actually go   within the Life Network and on the weekly AMA say,  hey Ben, how come you didn't ask the guests XYZ,  **1:04:39**and are you actually using ABC? Right. You can  actually interact with me within the Life Network  **1:04:45**in a much more personal way. And not just me,  but all these other experts and podcasters,   by the way, many of which you're going to be  familiar with when you join the Life Network.  **1:04:53**You're going to be blown away by the people we  have in there. But the way I think about it is   in an era of information overload, why not just  cut to the chase, get the stuff you want, and  **1:05:05**be supported by a community and experts who are  ensuring you get the most out of that information.**1:05:13**Caleb Applegate: Yeah, very well said. Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I agree. Simplicity, affordability,  **1:05:19**accessibility and just a world class experience  making it simple for people to understand  **1:05:26**what they need and what they  need to get in community.**1:05:32**Ben Greenfield: Caleb, I'm sure   people are wondering, and this is probably the  dumbest thing I've ever said on my podcast,  **1:05:39**but I don't remember what the  URL is for the Life Network. Caleb Applegate: Golifenetwork.com.  **1:05:44**We're not live yet. We're almost there. Ben Greenfield: We might be by the time this podcast comes out. Caleb Applegate: We might be. This  **1:05:51**is the beautiful thing. We're not promising  the future. We've built it. It's functional,  **1:05:56**it works. We have an active, pretty big dev  team working on this, doing an incredible job.  **1:06:02**Our entire team is filling this platform, this  network, with all sorts of incredible content,  **1:06:09**all the way from our coaching team, to our  partnerships team, to podcasts and all these  **1:06:14**new shows that we're creating again. Shout  out to our amazing team at Ben Greenfield  **1:06:19**Life. But everybody is incorporating into their  daily rhythms just content and contributions  **1:06:26**into the network. So this thing is going to be  rocking. I cannot wait to unveil it to the world.**1:06:32**Ben Greenfield: Yeah. And then a huge amount   of gratefulness to you, Caleb, because as you guys  listening and heard, we're talking like, you know,  **1:06:41**mineplex engine passages, taking all this  knowledge of how to make a slick user interface  **1:06:50**that's accessible, that's gamified, that's fun,  that doesn't break every hour while you're on it,  **1:06:56**and then marry that to the best of  the best. From health, from fitness,   from biohacking, from longevity, nutrition,  supplementation, etc. This is where, Caleb,  **1:07:05**you came in at a really clutch point, like being  able to actually pull this off from a technical  **1:07:13**standpoint. And for all you listening in, I know  we're getting a little long in the tooth here,   so we'll wrap up pretty soon, but you have to  see what this experience is like. And I mean,  **1:07:23**you heck, just like, you know, when  it's ready, go join. You don't,   you don't have to stay in if you don't want  to. Although I, I doubt that will be the case.**1:07:30**Ben Greenfield: But if you just want to surf around, see   what it looks like. Golifenetwork.com. And I mean,  yeah, I was even showing my wife and kids and  **1:07:38**they're like, wow, this is really professional.  This looks really good. And you don't see  **1:07:44**that a lot in the health and fitness space.  Something that's beautiful, but that also works.**1:07:50**Caleb Applegate: Yeah. I was on with one of our newly onboarded   core-contributing experts that probably so many  folks listening to the Ben Greenfield Life podcast  **1:08:02**would instantly recognize. And she, she was blown  away. And she said, and I quote, you have no idea  **1:08:11**how this is going to change lives. This is the  most beautiful platform I have ever seen in this  **1:08:18**space, end quote. And that was really encouraging  from a guy who doesn't come from the health and  **1:08:23**wellness space to be able to take my background,  kind of the culmination of everything that I've  **1:08:29**learned, intersect that with your expertise,  your relationships, all the knowledge base that  **1:08:36**you bring in and mash that all together, is really  exciting to see all of that come to life. So I am,  **1:08:44**man, I couldn't be more thrilled. Thank you  for the opportunity for believing in this   and allowing us this opportunity to release a  platform that will help change people's lives.**1:08:55**Ben Greenfield: Well, if you're listening in,   you know that I'm moving to Idaho. It just  so happens I'm moving about 20 minutes away  **1:09:02**from Caleb. So we're gonna keep building, keep  architecting, keep creating beautiful things that  **1:09:08**will change your life and transform you. And  the Life Network is now the hub for that.
