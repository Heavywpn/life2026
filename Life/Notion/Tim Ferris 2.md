and to watch and to participate in so thank you**0:31**very much for all of that and what I thought we would do is bounce back and**0:38**forth between these questions here and I'll**0:44**I'll do improv jav as improv jav improv Jazz as we go through and I'll pick some**0:51**questions and then we will also do some live questions so why don't we start with some live**0:58**questions I'll hop in here and I'll answer as many questions as I can that were presubmit as well RJ from Malaga**1:07**Spain believe it or not I have some ancestors from Malaga Spain one of them was killed in a bull fight so be careful**1:14**with the bull fights all right if you had to pick a topic for your podcast that I'd stick to from now on topic or  <br>**A focus on reinvention.1:21**theme would you pick probably reinvention of different types I think I**1:27**would focus on people who have reinvented themselves instead of sticking with the tried and true Groove**1:32**people who have taken the time or the space or just the attention to step back**1:39**and reexamine their assumptions reexamine the things that have worked up to this point that may not be those**1:46**things directionally that they want to continue pursuing so reinvention I think Kate and Cody how do you think about  <br>**Optimization.1:52**over optimization uh today many of us have the resources to enable us to spend**1:57**countless percentage of our life tweaking and attempting to op optimize every little thing I would say that you**2:03**want to pick very carefully what you choose to optimize as a very dear friend of mine I won't mention him by name**2:09**because you might not like that but very top 1% of 1% in terms of performer put**2:15**it to me he's like you want to be incredibly excellent the best you can be**2:20**in one or two things and then for everything else it's good enough passing grade for everything else**2:26**and he walks that walk and got a great family he's a great husband and father**2:33**he's very good at the things he chooses to optimize and for the rest he's not  <br>**Recent joy.2:39**worried Claudine what has brought me a ton of Joy or fun recently archery I've**2:44**been doing a lot of archery training not sure if you can see my forearms they are all screwed up I was shooting both right**2:51**and left-handed but find that incredibly uh joyful and meditative all right Joel**2:57**Hello Joel our group had so much in common it was so fun everyone wants to stay connected they asked if there might be more opportunities for me to**3:02**facilitate keeping us connected in the future the greatest joy that I got from the parties for the 10th anniversary and**3:09**so on was how many people came together with some shared interests or Curiosities at least who then wanted to**3:17**hang out after the event people who wanted to stay connected that made me super super happy that was really The**3:24**Not So secret agenda all along so that made me really happy and I'd like to explore ways that I can facilitate that**3:30**without having to manage it myself Cindy has a question [ __ ] punch update please  <br>**A CØCKPUNCH update.3:36**yes I have a ton of artwork and a lot of material to share with respect to World**3:42**building and frankly I've let Perfection be the enemy of good I've wanted to**3:48**present all this stuff in this high production value video with all the**3:53**bells and whistles and I've been sitting on this stuff for many months now and uh**3:59**I think that is my perfectionism getting in the way of Simply sharing these things so I have lots of stuff to share**4:08**and I need to get on that I would say in the next few weeks doesn't need to be fancy I feel at this point Expediting is**4:15**more important than optimizing delivery all right oh God worst funniest date I've**4:21**been on yeah we'll need another live chat to cover that Arena how am I today  <br>**How the day’s going so far.4:27**I'm doing really well uh beautiful day here it's a little warm I don't handle heat terribly well I'm going to go shoot**4:32**arrows after this Q&A and hang out with Molly outside I'll have her behind the**4:38**line of fire she's a very good archery dog in that way and uh a little tired**4:43**I'm not sure why I might have a fever I've been training really hard so who knows maybe there's a bug in the food or**4:49**something I've been very tired today it's unclear why cuz I got plenty of sleep um so that's how I am today but**4:55**happy to be doing the Q&A this is from Andre Andy from bu say what place does  <br>**Argentina affection.5:01**Argentina occupy in my heart today and why well I have deep affection for Argentina and the RGS and I would like**5:08**to get back down there honestly I recently for the first time in 20 years basically went to a Tango Festival in**5:16**Austin so I bought new shoes I didn't even have shoes I haven't done Tango in ages and I've forgotten 99% of it which**5:23**is very painful for me but had a blast just had so much fun there's nothing like it so I think at some point it's**5:30**possible I'll go back to Argentina and do 3 to four weeks full immersion tons of Tango lots of steak and probably lots**5:38**of malbeck at the same time uh so I would say I'm I'm very eager to get down**5:44**there revisit it learn of the current events and leadership in particular in**5:49**Argentina which I find very interesting and we'll go from there what type of business/ investment is the most  <br>**Intriguing investments.5:56**exciting for me right now anything that is aligned I'd say and this isn't an invitation for pitches but anything**6:02**that's really aligned with my the sort of ethos that I might**6:09**be looking to incorporate more in my life so for instance Maui neie venison from an ecological perspective from a**6:16**Founder perspective husband and wife team incredibly high integrity beautiful**6:22**family beautiful people and also very good operators it's a good business but**6:27**it's also doing a lot for or the sort of native ecosystem in Hawaii so that'd be**6:35**an example of something that's I feel very aligned with even though it's not the kind of tech multiples that we would be used to in potential outcomes**6:42**something I feel very good about also very involved with quite a bit of climate work and let's just call it**6:48**technology intended to help with many of the extreme weather and climate**6:54**challenges that we're going to continue to face top three snacks I'm eating right now  <br>**Top three snacks.7:00**yeah I mean I have Maui Nei right around the corner so the Maui Nei venison sticks and then often it's it's some**7:06**type of mixed nuts minus peanuts and let's say cans of lentils so boring**7:14**but I find that very helpful there are a number of questions about AI I would say  <br>**AI thoughts.7:19**I largely feel unqualified to have strong opinions about this but if I**7:26**invest and I've invested in one or two AI SP focused**7:31**companies they're very Niche and they have some type of at least intermediate**7:38**term defensible mode a lot of the AI stuff that's trained on publicly**7:44**available data is just going to get cloned as soon as it shows any traction and uh as some people may have noticed a**7:51**lot of stuff that was web 3 at one point those people have now pivoted into Ai**7:56**and I'm I'm trying to be cautious of anything that is kind of the investment**8:02**sector dour and there's still interesting things in web 3 although I think**8:07**blockchain is probably a better way to put it and they're very interesting things in AI but I like to invest in**8:14**what I know where I think I have an informational advantage and I do not think I have an informational Advantage**8:20**with AI question on on a few different things I'll pick two of these on Modern dating as a public figure how do you  <br>**Modern dating.8:26**navigate the complexities of modern da I would say slowly and very carefully**8:32**what qualities do I look for in a partner to ensure a meaningful and sustainable relationship well first and foremost I would say the the smaller the**8:39**social media footprint the more comfortable I am but it also makes it very hard to find people if they're not online since it's not like I'm going out**8:46**to bars and just doing cold approaches so I would say uh**8:52**discretion someone who prefers a certain degree of privacy those are those are all indicators for me and in the**8:59**positive direction for trustworthiness I recognize a lot of people live online so that's just the**9:05**nature of our current day but I look for those things a demonstrated ability to**9:11**do hard things over longer periods of time I want to know that life isn't always hard for someone so if they're**9:17**able to focus on let's just say higher education for four years at a demanding**9:24**University that doesn't automatically make them a Super Genius who's perfect for me but it shows probably they're**9:29**able to focus on on certain things that are challenging for extended periods of time same thing if they've been at jobs**9:35**for at least some jobs for more than one or two years if it's constantly Lily Pad**9:42**hopping all over the place I don't find that to always mean someone is very**9:49**resilient when things get hard and things always get hard at some point so**9:54**those are a few then there's all the stuff you could guess you know beautiful feminine all that stuff uh but I would**10:03**say those are those are a few also someone who has an identity where they feel confident in having done hard**10:10**things that's the other benefit of I would say people who have done something objectively to the extent that**10:17**it's possible difficult is they have a certain confidence that helps the whole relationship right I feel like you need**10:24**to have a certain identity confidence in your own own ability and skills and selfhood**10:32**self-authoring before you can really be a good partner I think that's I think**10:37**that's the case as best I can tell but I'm I don't think I'm the last person**10:42**you would want relationship advice from but let's wait until I have it a little more figured out on self-experimentation  <br>**Self-experimentation to come.10:48**you're known as using yourself as a guinea pig what are the next five things I'm planning to experiment with uh I'll**10:54**probably get back on look I I don't do as much crazy experimentation as I used to I am looking at some regenerative**11:01**medicine protocols uh possibly for helping inflammation and some of the lower back stuff which is greatly**11:07**improved since I started doing a few things but the jury is still out so I'm not going to get into that yet I don't want to make any prescriptive**11:14**recommendations until I've really tested things and uh archery training bunch of new types of archery training that I'm**11:20**excited to play around with and uh beyond that really a lot of it is just**11:27**putting in the work with things that I believe will be high leverage like working**11:33**on hips internal and external rotation and a few other things that I think**11:38**directly contribute to overall core and low**11:44**back functionality for lack of a better way to put it but nothing crazy in my**11:50**opinion uh some of the medical stuff people might think is crazy but it's it's pretty pretty solid research that's**11:57**backing this stuff you know 10 to 20 years of research search so I don't I don't feel like it's high risk what risks have I taken in the last 10 years  <br>**Analyzing the past decade’s risks.12:03**that have really paid off are there any that did not pay off well you know the**12:08**podcast we could look at as a risk but risk for me is a very specific thing so**12:14**when people say this is risky this isn't risky I think definitions matter a lot for me risk is the potential of an**12:22**irreversible negative outcome very few things fall in that category so the podcast was very off the**12:28**beaten path for me but I didn't view it as risky because I could always stop doing it I could always just hit cancel**12:35**it was low cost to get started I enjoyed the process so the outcome wasn't the**12:40**only measure of success for me and uh that was quite a Divergence**12:46**that paid off certainly paid off I would say that I've made some good investment**12:52**calls and I've made some bad investment calls so the good ones fortunately make up more than make up for the the bad**12:59**ones but with let's just say web 3 as an example I went very heavy and hard into**13:05**a lot of web 3 and put money into a bunch of different funds and various things uh cockp punch as an nft project**13:12**was successful and I set expectations I think properly at the beginning uh if you go back and read that fq like I've**13:18**delivered on all of those and I'm going to deliver continually beyond that I have a lot more to share and everyone**13:24**else has run for the not everyone else but pretty much everyone else has run for the Hills and they're like forget**13:29**about all that no no forget about all that sleep sleep they don't want anybody to remember I don't mind at all because**13:36**I didn't I took all those proceeds and donated to the foundation the foundation Cay Foundation is going to do some**13:42**amazing work with the whatever it ended up being $2 million or something maybe a little bit**13:47**more so a lot of good will come of that and it was a huge creative Catalyst for**13:54**me and I think that without that I wouldn't be working on a new book**14:00**project right now as an example so it it checked all the boxes in terms of its objectives but as a sector I would say**14:08**uh took a took a lot of huge hits on that one and you live and learn you know I**14:14**wasn't playing with money I couldn't afford to lose but it was it was enough that it was very painful so there's an**14:21**experiment that didn't pan out but there's a reason they call them experiments and not**14:27**guarantees uh but yeah you got to choose your bet sizing properly so you don't put yourself in a bad situation all right so**14:35**that risks that it paid off that was from Rebecca Andre currently in a moment where I  <br>**Outthinking a career bottleneck.14:40**don't know what to do professionally have you had those moments yeah right now I'm not sure not sure what I want to**14:46**be when I grow up and uh some days it's really stressful to be honest which sounds silly I know but it is I like**14:53**having a plan I like executing to plan so the book is really the only**14:58**thing that is in my sights at the moment that uh looks clear otherwise what I'm**15:06**doing my best to do is try a lot of little things little experiments expose**15:12**myself to new people have couple of exploratory conversations a week or read**15:19**things listen to things I wouldn't usually read or listen to and have confidence because I've figured it out**15:26**multiple times in the past that I will figure it out again I don't need to fog myself unnecessarily I've yet to find**15:33**that helpful so that may not be super tactical at this point but that's that's**15:40**what I've been telling myself on my good days when I'm not beating the [ __ ] out of myself in my own head David what is  <br>**My current big project.15:45**your current next project that I'm excited about how are you approaching it differently so this is I say the new**15:53**book I'm actually being much more collaborative with this book than I have in the past and that that's proving to**15:59**be a godsend because I have people to bounce things off of and to interact with it's just psychologically I think**16:07**much healthier at least at this point in my life than being a lone wolf on these**16:12**projects because Lone Wolf it's not a thing by the way like look at nature no Lone Wolf survives doesn't**16:18**work so I'm uh using that as a broad way to experiment and by the way [ __ ] punch**16:25**was a precursor to that because I worked really well with what you guys will see soon with the concept art and a lot of**16:32**the collaborative writing that was done and it was awesome it was a great process really had fun it wasn't just**16:38**locking myself in a cave like I'm in solitary confinement and that is what I'm trying**16:45**to emulate also in the uh writing of this new book so we'll see I mean I have**16:52**about four or 500 pages drafted so it's going to be it's going to be another big**16:57**one but you know that's what I do have you experimented with peptides I  <br>**Peptides.17:03**experimented with uh is it BMP 157 or bpc 157 like 12 years ago long time ago**17:10**so I am at a date with peptides but I did experiment way back in the**17:16**day but I really need to educate myself before I can have any thoughts on that**17:21**whatsoever and by the way just as a quick aside with anyone online if they  <br>**Be wary of high conviction.17:27**only have high conviction statements if they really speak confidently all the time be very wary of those**17:34**people people who are being honest should say I have no [ __ ] idea all the time or they should say you know**17:41**what I'm not really sure I need to educate myself everyone online should have that**17:46**response a lot if they don't then you're not going to be able to separate out the real from the fake because they're saying everything with the same high**17:52**level of conviction be really careful about that what mindfulness practices do I use to prepare for high stakes  <br>**Preparation for high-stakes presentations.17:58**presentation or performances I would say I don't let**18:05**fear make me afraid in the sense that I I really remind myself if you weren't**18:12**nervous right then it would be a bigger problem it is normal to be nervous**18:17**before you go up like my hands are shaking a little bit I've done these things hundreds of times and I still get nervous I still get sweaty I still drink**18:24**too much Diet Coke or coffee or whatever beforehand as a ritual which just makes me more shaky obviously and it's like**18:32**it's okay it's fine like anyone who's going out to perform at a high level or attempting to do it at a high level is**18:39**going to be nervous so just use it like Mike Tyson would puke before he went on stage well on stage in the ring Dean**18:45**Martin used to puke before he went on stage I mean these These are legends right I'm not saying you want to emulate everything about them but these are**18:51**people who are at the top of their field so it's okay for them it's okay for you so I just remind myself of that and and**18:59**I will rehearse my ass off there's no mental trick you can do beforehand if you haven't prepared and for me the**19:07**preparation is the mindfulness practice I mean with my TED talk like I rehearsed**19:12**it so many times into voice memo on my phone walking around I mean hundreds of times so by the time I got to the day of**19:20**the presentation on the main stage of Ted I was like well I've put in the time**19:26**the deliberate practice I've done everything I can do so I am as prepared**19:31**as I will ever be so let it rip let's see what happens uh I'd say that's**19:37**that's the mindfulness practice I thought about doing content more geared at kids  <br>**Kid stuff?19:43**teens yeah I've thought about that I thought about it I'm not sure what the best venue is but I am going to be doing**19:49**some experimentation for students probably older students though kind of University or business school  <br>**Getting the most out of a Tim Ferriss meetup.19:56**level what am I looking to get out of the TF meetups and how can we help how can you help you know that was a**20:03**question so if some folks have asked like what question came up a lot some of the questions are just like hey how's it going because the interactions are so**20:10**short they're like hey how's it going um you know where you where are you where do you want to go and then we'd run out**20:15**of time but one of the questions was like how can we be helpful to you and my answer was and is now connect with**20:23**like-minded people do stuff in real life and this ties into AI it's like if if**20:28**you want to if you want to I think harness your**20:36**Humanity do stuff in real life like meet people man because the Poison's coming**20:42**in terms of information delus it's going to 10x in the next 10 to 18 months and**20:48**most minds and habits are not going to be ready for that I think it's**20:54**impossible to be ready but to be more resilient I would just say do more in real life like connect with like-minded**21:00**people try to do meetups you can do Zoom or something like that if you can't do**21:06**live but like really seek out your tribe and if those people happen to overlap with the people**21:12**who came to the meetups which was my hope then great like you just connected with a bunch of people who might**21:21**be of kind of similar similar tribe so I would say I would say do that will I  <br>**In-person conferences planned?21:27**plan any iners some conferences I don't have any plans right this moment um Joel I see your note on IBS I don't have a  <br>**IBS relief.21:34**lot of thoughts on IBS I apologize I just don't know much about it uh I mean you what you could do and I**21:41**don't know if this will work but I mean you could just use like metamol citrus cell beforehand I mean it does slow**21:47**gastric emptying and it does also reduce glycemic index so if you're going to eat a meal you know it's going to spike your**21:52**glycemic index side note you can take like five of these capsules with uh fiber just a slow things down so that**21:59**the release isn't as intense uh so but I'm not a doctor I try not to pretend to**22:05**be one on the internet but I I really don't know much about IBS unfortunately but I'm looking at**22:13**anti-inflammatory protocols that could have an effect on this type of issue but I haven't looked at it well**22:19**enough so I don't want to give you any opinions what are some of my heresies um I mean I think a heresy that  <br>**Personal heresies.22:27**I have is just I think a lot of what we try to do**22:32**in Modern Life is a very new experiment right so I think if we look back at**22:38**older societies and they're not all rose-colored right it's it's very**22:44**seductive to look back at indigenous group X Y or Z and say oh you know they had it all figured out they were in tune**22:49**with nature and it's like well if you go back you also very often even now see**22:55**domestic abuse and lots of alcoholism other issues so it's it's not ever perfect anywhere but I would say if we**23:03**look at what gives people meaning I think we've been LED astray**23:08**with a lot of kind of brainwashing and theory that doesn't map very well to**23:17**anthropological study or really just common behaviors that you see around the world that seem to have some durability**23:24**and Nasim Talib talks about this a lot so I would just say broadly thinking**23:30**that in a lot of ways individually just in terms of like rugged individualism**23:36**we've gone off track a bit and**23:41**that a lot of the I'd say common ways that we plan our careers and lives are**23:48**actually at odds with ultimately what's going to give us fulfillment I would say can unpack that more another time so a  <br>**What makes conferences worthwhile for me?23:55**couple people asking about conferences maybe maybe at some point I'll do a conference it would be quite small you**24:00**know it wouldn't be more than 200 people so if I ever did it it's a lot of work frankly and when I did it last time it**24:09**was basically not for profit because I spent so much money on the quality of the event so I don't know I'm I'm not**24:16**sure I have the energy to do it as a nonprofit and if it were not to be a nonprofit it would just be stupidly**24:21**expensive it would be like 30 grand a person or something obscene which I would feel kind of silly  <br>**Longevity and healthspan.24:28**putting out there how realistic is it to consider the health span possibility RJ**24:33**to get to 150 years old in good health I'm not really sure how to evaluate this to be honest I I'm more focused these**24:40**days on experiential lifespan and trying to harness and I've spoken about this**24:46**before but trying to organize events Gatherings of**24:53**friends in some cases very intense physical experiences like long difficult**24:58**hikes or pilgrimage trails with people I really care for to basically pack a few**25:05**months into say a week at a time I think that's a reliable actionable way to extend your**25:12**experiential lifespan right to feel like you've basically packed 150 years into your let's say 85 uh most attempts at**25:23**extending longevity in any meaningful way have all failed to date right and maybe we are in**25:29**fact at this cusp of all these Amazing Discoveries that will lead us to live a really long time maybe that's Rapa maybe**25:35**that's some type of Tim restricted feeding maybe that is fall of Statin maybe it's who the [ __ ] knows you know**25:43**there's always something there's always some new ponon Fountain of Youth that**25:48**people have found especially on the internet I'm not super bullish on that stuff here's the thing I would say for**25:55**myself they're likely to fail so I would rather have low expectations and be pleasantly surprised later than to take**26:03**all of these things and suffer what will most definitely be significant side effects**26:10**that we haven't foreseen with a lot of this new stuff so like fall stat for instance like it basically cripples FSH and**26:18**animal models so it's like do you really want to be infertile uh can you reverse that after the fact like yeah great you**26:24**have eight pack and you look younger than you did 8 weeks ago but now your balls don't work so I'm not ready to**26:31**make that trade you know maybe after I have three or four kids sure but uh I would just be very careful with that**26:37**kind of stuff so 150 I mean if we're talking about that in the next you know**26:44**basically putting people on a Glide path that will land them there in the next 10 to 15 years I'm pretty skeptical I mean**26:50**especially with increases in environmental toxins and other issues that will besiege Humanity over the next**26:57**10 to 20 years certainly I mean more weather issues forc migrations all sorts of [ __ ] um I'm not dystopian about it**27:06**but I'm not it should tell you something that I'm not about my personal beliefs at**27:12**least that I'm not doing a lot of that stuff yeah I mean if you account for infant mortality and antibiotics and**27:19**then you look at say my entire family history on both sides it's like yeah males tend to die around 85 that's just**27:25**the way it goes so I would love to live longer but I'm not going to take a lot of**27:31**unnecessary risks where I see significant potential downside so long answer I'm interested in it for sure**27:38**like I track some of the science Andy Bruce any tips on walk in the Kumo cot though taking your 11-year-old son with  <br>**Tips for a father-and-son Kumano Kodo walk.27:44**you that's cool that's fun uh there are a million different ways to walk this pilgrimage Trail in Japan which is the**27:52**sister Trail of the commo de Santiago in Europe there's the only two**27:58**world heritage pilgrimage Trails so there are like a thousand different ways you can do the kumoko it's like a**28:05**tributaries that then filter down to the main Shrine and Temple because they**28:12**basically took like Shinto mapping and then put Buddhism on top of it I would**28:17**pick one that crosses rivers and water if you can that's just really Pleasant feature when you're hauling ass and**28:24**getting really sweaty and so on bring walking sticks for sure like poles**28:31**especially for the downhill you'll be walking on Rock a lot it's very hard on the joints so nice thick heels you know**28:39**hoca shoes or something like that I would suggest like you will feel it in**28:44**your ankles and your knees and uh you know my thought is if you're going to do something longer because some people**28:51**will do like a week at a time or 10 days at a time you could spend months on the K codo is do a little bit less than you**28:59**think you can each day like don't push it super hard because you may be then handicapped the next day if your knee**29:04**really bothers you you're not going to you're not going to want to put a lot of weight on that for the next 10**29:10**kilometers or 20 kilom right so I'd do a little bit less than you think you can each day something about the Tweet of  <br>**A barbell distribution approach to life.29:17**the kettle B swings is King of the exercise where else can you find the king of X could be relationships Finance**29:22**anything I think you I think a lot about barbell approaches to life so for**29:28**instance like highrisk Angel Investing and then like mun bonds as boring and as stable as you get right so it's kind of**29:34**one or the other like highrisk high return with small amounts of money or**29:40**very stable predictable boring and not playing in the middle as soon as you start playing**29:46**in the middle you're like I'm going to play with tech growth stocks da da and then you at least in my experience**29:52**that's how you get your face ripped off or that's how I get I get my face ripped off so I think about barbell distributions a lot in physical Fitness**29:58**and finance and everywhere aside from Richard Fineman if I could bring back one person from the dead for a podcast  <br>**Who would I resurrect for a podcast interview?30:05**episode who would it be oh man there's so many right I'm tempted to say like Marcus Aurelius or something but Sena**30:13**who knows I mean probably senica because I've just read so much of his stuff and I'm curious if I would find the guy to be an arrogant prick or what the vibe**30:21**would be in person right assuming we're speaking the same language I would be super curious about senica he gets a**30:27**very mixed review but I mean I'm once again listening to an audio book uh on anger or Ona**30:34**Ira I mean his writing is amazing the guy's writing is amazing but what would he be like in person would I be like oh**30:41**yeah this is the uncle who talks too much God this guy's longwinded maybe Ben Franklin I'd be interested very**30:47**interested in um those are a few that come to mind I mean I I could come up with 100 more for sure but those are**30:54**those are two off the top of my head do I have any mentors that I contact regularly for Life advice this is from  <br>**Do I consult any mentors regularly?30:59**Jeff I found in midlife that I really missed out on having fatherly mentors in my 20s and 30s yeah there are I talked**31:05**to uh one this morning in fact he's uh early 70s very**31:11**healthy really takes care of himself great marriage close to his kids and I think he has grandkids now and so we did**31:18**a check-in for about an hour today caught up and this is a good reminder for me to do**31:25**that more often so I do feel I do feel good good about that Paula what are my  <br>**Ayahuasca and antidepressants.31:30**thoughts on iasa on anti-depressants you've been doing iwaska for 13 years only just started taking anti-depressants unsure if I**31:37**should mix both this is from Brazil you need to be very very very careful so IA**31:44**plus certain anti-depressants like ssris can cause a potentially fatal serotonin**31:49**syndrome so you need to be very very very careful with that so I would**31:55**absolutely speak with doctors about that I not mix them until you get the go ahead from doctors and I I imagine a**32:02**psychiatrist who prescribe the anti-depressants I'd be very careful with that iasa is one of the one of the**32:08**riskier compounds at least of the let's call it classically known psychedelics with respect to combining**32:14**with anti-depressants so I'd be very careful with that and side note I learned not too long ago that people who**32:21**were taking Lithium should really not screw around with psychedelics a lot of Adverse Events**32:27**been reported at least with some of the classical let's just call it not not entirely tryptamine but LSD**32:35**psilocybin Etc so if you're taking higher doses of of lithium now there's some there are some ways that could be**32:43**conflated because of people are taking lithium what are they taking it for they might be taking it for any number of conditions that would be contraindicated**32:48**with psychedelics in the first place so who knows but uh I wouldn't mix lithium**32:54**with these things either how can you incentivize someone to Mentor you I'm not sure how to do that I mean I I think  <br>**Incentivizing potential mentors.33:01**you need to be a really good student number one he said no money possible I mean frankly I pay I pay for it a lot I**33:08**mean I have friends who learn from me and I learn from them and they're older than I am and I consider them**33:14**mentors but at the end of the day I actually find it in some ways cleaner to**33:20**just pay someone and uh if you wanted to get mentorship that isn't expensive like**33:26**maybe you go to Toastmaster or you join the EO like entrepreneurs organization**33:32**or YPO depends on what you're looking for but like mentors don't need to be expensive at all you know I have a**33:38**mentor in archery and he's also kind of a mental performance coach doesn't need**33:43**to break the bank so I would say you know you can go to your local YMCA and find a coach in some Sport and if**33:50**they're good at all at anything they will have life lessons for you especially if they're a bit older so I**33:57**would say that my advice for the moment do I babysit sometimes for some of my friends uh I mean not really  <br>**Adventures in babysitting.34:04**babysit but like I'll watch their kids for a little bit or watch a Disney movie with their kids like young kids uh how**34:10**did I find it I think I look I think I'm a kid at heart so for me animals and kids are I don't want to**34:17**say easy but especially if they're little I find them pretty easy I think**34:24**when if I have kids which is the Hope at least if they get to the point where they're like**34:31**petulant kind of like mean-spirited um kids where they're just**34:37**being [ __ ] I think I'll have a hard time with that I think I will have a hard time once they like know which buttons they're pushing and they're just**34:43**like drilling it in that I'm going to have trouble with but like little kids who just like are disregulated and lose**34:49**their [ __ ] because they haven't developed their prefrontal cortex like yeah like I can I can deal with that**34:55**pretty well my opinion of this is from Judy  <br>**GLP-1 for depression/anxiety.35:00**glp1 medications this would be like munaro or OIC uh glp want agonists believe they're**35:08**in clinical trials now for depression anxiety yeah I haven't looked at them specifically for that did put up a blog**35:14**post recently from Johan Hari on glp1 specifically so if you want to get some**35:20**of the science and also a firsthand report of that I would uh just go on tim. blog and search Johan J n n last**35:28**name Har h a r i all right so this piece of artwork you know people love this I  <br>**Cheap but choice art.35:34**love it too I bought this for $80 at an antique Warehouse in the middle of**35:40**nowhere I saw it and I just loved it and grabbed it I love it every time I see it**35:47**maybe it was less 60 60 bucks 80 bucks at an antique Warehouse yeah it's one of**35:52**my favorite pieces of art that's a turkey tail below it a lot of turkeys around here**35:59**uh or not tail turkey feather for agents book agents and stuff uh last time I  <br>**Finding a book agent.36:05**checked which was a long time ago Publishers Marketplace is a great place to look also find books that are kind of**36:10**in the same category or vein as yours look at the acknowledgements and you'll very often see the agent there then you**36:17**can reach out to them directly through something like Publishers Marketplace or these days a lot of these agents or agencies have their own websites  <br>**Making positive, in-person connections.36:23**thoughts on how to approach making some great in-person connections yeah I would look at my talk I gave it South by Southwest which had the title how to**36:31**build a worldclass network in record time something click baity like that but it actually delivers uh I would check**36:38**that out all right this is from Dolan Dolan okay the last set was from Claudine thank you for those this one's  <br>**Unmentioned things I’d like to talk about.36:45**from Dolan if I'm pronouncing that correctly basically anything that I would like to talk about that I haven't**36:51**had an opportunity to talk about yet for instance my interest SL journey in connecting with animals and nature maybe**36:56**some insights for my personal exploration of psychedelic and non-ordinary states of Consciousness over the last 10 years so I**37:05**have probably a thousand pages of notes on all this and at some point I feel**37:11**like that might be the most important book that I write but it's going to be it's going to be a lot to put it**37:17**together so in a way the book I'm doing now where I'm collaborating is sort of a possible warm-up for that because I I**37:23**don't think it's a book that I would want to do by myself it would just be such a heavy lift**37:28**and uh yeah we'll see we shall see but I**37:34**think if I if I talk about that at some huge length it'll probably be in a book I'd want to think about it because it'll**37:40**get so strange it will get so unbelievably strange number one first all the**37:47**scientific regulatory kind of on the radar above the line**37:56**logistical stuff that I want to handle in the Psychedelic Therapeutics world I want to handle first because if I ever**38:03**write this book it is going to get so weird that at least 20% of the people**38:08**who read it are going to think I'm completely insane it'll just be so strange I wouldn't want it to damage my**38:16**current credibility that I have to get things done in those worlds and U**38:21**including some of the stuff with animals man it gets I mean if you talk to people who've**38:28**like been in this stuff for let's just say culturally for**38:33**hundreds or thousands of years it's not weird but to most folks it's going to sound pretty [ __ ] weird which I get**38:40**excited about but I'm going to wait until I'm like you know what I don't give a [ __ ] what anyone thinks cuz it's not going to interrupt anything else**38:46**that I'm doing I don't care then maybe that book but it's going to be a little while this is from  <br>**Is there room for the irrational?38:51**andrece all right so it's a it's a longer let's see here I'll paraphrase**38:57**here basically I'm very rational and methodical about decision-making and so on rational approach is admirable but**39:04**sometimes being a rational or spontaneous can inject a lot of energy and fun have I found space for**39:09**rationality to play a role in my life the irrational and emotional for decisions and if so have they ever led**39:17**me to alter my wellth thought out plans for the year so I would say yes I don't**39:22**know if IR rational it would be the word I would use Maybe because you have**39:28**like let's take moral I don't know what the proper word would be here but you have you have moral behaviors you have**39:35**immoral behaviors and let's just call those nonmoral behaviors then you have amoral behaviors that are kind of like**39:42**in this no man's land so I would say if you have like rational**39:47**rational irrational the opposite then there's like irrational I don't think that's a word but somewhere in the**39:54**middle where it's like it's it's not it's not driven by Logic it's driven**39:59**more by feeling I'm doing more and more of that these days for sure I mean our sort of**40:07**evolved system here with lots of valuable apparatus for navigating**40:14**reality predates Language by at least this kind of language by millions of years so uh**40:22**yes I found space for that although I'd be very careful about I see this quite a**40:27**bit in Austin and places like it where there's this like Neo new Agy stuff**40:33**where people are like I'm just using my intuition and I think very often that is**40:39**used for people used by people who just want a justification for doing what they want to do or doing something that is**40:46**easier than the hard thing and they're like well I'm just using my intuition right intuition is interesting to me**40:51**when it points you in a direction you didn't expect right where let just say**40:57**you go on a date and on paper they're perfect and you're like I'm going to love this person and then you meet them and you're**41:03**like something's a little weird here like I want to like them but this isn't right that's where intuition is valuable**41:10**right or like a business deal everything looks perfect and then there's something about it like uh my gut just doesn't**41:16**feel right that's where intuition is interesting if you're like this all looks perfect on paper and you know what**41:23**even though all my friends are telling me it's a terrible investment my intuition tells me to do it like that's where I'd be like well like wait a**41:29**minute here is this just confirmation bias what are my thoughts on blogging in  <br>**Blogging in the age of AI.41:35**the age of AI I mean look AI is amazing it's really incredible but writing for**41:41**me is a way of clarifying my own thinking and I do think that taking the time to craft words without the**41:47**assistance of AI is helpful I might use AI to get past the blank page but I**41:52**think it's seductive as a drug and just like most people people can't tell**41:58**Direction without Google Maps now I think it's it's very possible almost inevitable that people will lose certain**42:05**faculties that they currently have by overusing AI so uh we shall see but I**42:12**plan on doing more writing to the oldfashioned way I have not used binaural beats I am very interested in  <br>**Binaural beats.42:20**that and actually just reminded me somebody owes me something on binaural beats so if you have any recommendations**42:28**for what types of binaural beads let me know forour dog training yeah maybe  <br>**4-Hour Dog Training?42:35**Never Say Never best thousand I spent lately I mean it was more than that but on the archery training it's always  <br>**Best $1,000 spent lately.42:42**something like that it's very rarely stuff I mean sometimes it's stuff like there's**42:49**a I bought an extra soite PSO RIT and a mini Rumble roller that I**42:59**can travel with and those have been amazing for just like rolling out my**43:06**glutes and per foris and my legs and stuff before bed really helps with sleep a lot but that's like I don't know 100**43:14**bucks 150 um I buy very well I try to buy very little stuff**43:21**it just ends up causing me more stress as clutter around my house than the value that it adds so so I try to get**43:27**rid of a lot of stuff good question of the was the last $1,000 worth of clutter**43:32**that gave me the most relief when I gave it away that's what I should think about am I aware of Javier M I think that's  <br>**Javier Milei.43:39**how you say his name in Argentina I am I've actually listened to some of his speeches pretty interesting stuff I**43:44**don't know enough about them but a number of my friends are are big fans so need to do more research best thing that  <br>**Best thing I spent an “assload” on.43:51**I spent an ass load on uh what's the best thing I spent an ass load on not to get too technical would be a family trip**43:58**I took my parents and brother and his wife on a trip around Europe and um that**44:04**was definitely an assload of cash but I think that was a good good investment and um I would recommend everyone read**44:10**something called The Tail End by Tim Urban that is a good investment of time**44:16**it's very short do I like painting not sketching as a hobby I haven't learned  <br>**Painting.44:21**how to paint I would like to dabble in ideally watercolor I think think but do  <br>**10–20 minutes on the acupuncture mat.44:28**I have any quick tips for getting up to 10 to 20 minutes on the acupuncture mat yeah that's for people who are curious**44:36**the naoya ACU pressure mat I think or other there are a lot of imitations that**44:42**I'm sure just as just as good I don't go to 20 minutes typically but like 10 to**44:48**15 if I'm going to do it the first three minutes are going to be torer so you just have to get through the first like 3 to four minutes is my**44:55**experience otherwise I don't have I don't have much to tell you it can be it can be pretty  <br>**Dating apps.45:01**intense thoughts on dating apps oh man this is like Warren Buffett covering his**45:08**eyes and like pointing towards Wall Street because half the people are going to have terrible experiences uh I don't know to be frank**45:16**I mean I I think hinge has been one of the better options so far I think that**45:22**in terms of just quality people have to pass some hurdles and add some information uh the league is pretty interesting also**45:29**because you can search by interest which is so critical I don't know why you can't do it on any other app but you can**45:35**search for like skiing or whatever to find somebody who has similar interests but the league is really only effective**45:41**in certain cities it's not used widely everywhere but like in a place like New York City or LA or whatever you could**45:47**find people who are pretty well educated interesting uh but a downside is people**45:52**tend not to use it that frequently so you might have a great match and they don't see your message for 6 months**45:59**so go figure it's a jungle out there folks be careful and there are a lot of**46:04**people catfishing so watch out for that too do a video call before you meet up with someone what's my favorite science  <br>**Favorite sci-fi movies.46:11**fiction movie and why big fan of the second Dune movie frankly uh ex bakina I**46:17**remember really enjoying there are a lot of great science fiction movies I think her was fantastic and you know at the time it seemed insane and it's basically**46:25**already there if you look at get the latest editions of chat GPT and so on**46:30**things like replica with a K replica uh yeah her is basically already here it's**46:37**pretty nuts with questions about [ __ ] punch it'll it'll be more interesting once I release the rest of the stuff or**46:45**a bunch of it then you'll have a lot more to chew on and I'll give you a foreshadowing it's not really a**46:50**foreshadowing it is a statement that I hope is a statement of fact and that is I will have some some fan writing**46:57**competitions like elimination competitions and so that**47:02**will reward people who really dig into the details they'll also have to be decent writing of course Claudine have I  <br>**Reflecting on the impact this show has had on others.47:11**let the enormity of 10 years of TFS really land not just from a metrics POV but from a positive kindness deepening**47:17**Etc human level it's been such a Force for good and lighten this world thank you Claud and that's very kind of you to**47:22**say I would say that I I did**47:27**when the celebrations were happening but I could do a better job I could do a**47:33**better job of sitting with that so thank you for the reminder it's easy for me to**47:39**just like move on like yeah yeah good job but like you just did your job so don't get too happy with yourself and**47:45**like what's next what's next right like yeah you did your job and that's fine but like don't get too**47:52**smug about it or self-satisfied but I find that pretty that can be very self-defeating right so I did take time**47:58**to celebrate for the 10th anniversary and I had a great time the inperson meet up in Paris was great and it was really**48:04**fun to in person hear the stories from people who are deeply affected by the podcast so thank you for the reminder I**48:11**will I will um I will take a moment today to revisit that thank**48:17**you I should travel to meet girls well I mean why was I in Europe for 6 to8 weeks  <br>**Why was I in Europe for six to eight weeks?48:23**uh who knows maybe it was related to that is it possible that my mood improved during this Q&A yeah it's  <br>**The mood-altering effects of Q&A.48:29**entirely possible I was exhausted guys I'm not going to lie at the beginning of this but I enjoy these interactions so**48:36**it is certainly possible that my mood improved as a function of my energy going up so thanks for that everybody  <br>**Where do I see myself in 30 years?48:43**where do I see myself in 30 years good Lord I don't know hopefully not six feet under we'll see I'll be 30 years I'll be**48:52**40 no 76 77 [ __ ] so I don't know**48:57**hopefully I'll be doing Black Diamond skiing because uh we found the Fountain of Youth have you suggested a workout  <br>**Workout routines for older parents.49:04**routine this is mags for my parents if not what would it potentially look like how would you approach it yeah I would**49:10**say super slow protocol look up Ken Hutchins and the super slow protocol and**49:16**uh yeah my dad's lost I don't know 80 lbs like let's call it 40 kilos in the last year so he's**49:23**made a lot of progress that's slow carb diet it's a straightforward from four our body and then super slow as applied**49:32**so super slow in in very basic terms is minimum 5 Seconds up 5 Seconds down so if you're doing a pressing movement five**49:39**seconds slow right up five seconds down one set one set to concentric**49:46**failure uh could be even slower could be 10 seconds up 10 seconds down but**49:51**especially in elderly quite effective for building muscle mass and increasing bone density without injury so that is**49:59**probably what I would I mean that's what I prescribed to my parents that plus walking to the extent**50:06**that it's possible Right Kind of barbell once again with slow carb diet is the glue that holds everything together how  <br>**How I walk and talk for podcasts.50:13**do I record a podcast while walking this right here this**50:22**is atm50x it's an Audio Technica headset it's has**50:29**a USBC attachment plug that into your iPhone and then you can use Riverside or some other app there are a lot of**50:36**different ways to record this is from Mariana over the years I've followed and learned from you  <br>**Would I consider becoming a single parent?50:41**and your guest I've heard you say several times that I'm interested in parenting have you ever considered being a single parent family by choice I too**50:46**for many years was trying to find the perfect partner till I turned 41 and my doctor told me it was time to unfreeze my eggs since I was still single and**50:52**look for the partner decided my best option was to be a single parent so I got a non and ious donor and had my son**50:57**when I was 43 as I'm almost six now we travel the world together could not be happier with the drama-free life we have**51:03**just wishing to see you fulfill your parenting dream and wondered if I would consider this option too yeah I would consider it I would consider it you know**51:10**I think for a long time it was no but I would consider it I would I mean of**51:16**course ideally I would have the partner but I would consider it yeah it's not**51:22**off the table but I'm still fighting the fight getting back into the dating as**51:29**much as I'm just like [ __ ] this is this is a young man's game doing this online dating**51:35**[ __ ] uh frankly just the communications burden is so much G yeah**51:42**so anyway but to answer your question yeah it's on the table for me Joel I see  <br>**A $1 million coffee mug?51:47**yours one of my big goals is to create the world's first coffee mug to sell for more than a million dollars I like that**51:53**I like that as a goal I don't really have a great recommendation for how to chip away at**51:59**it you could look at from a PR perspective at least people who**52:04**have you know sold pieces of the Brooklyn Bridge or sold hamburgers that are like**52:10**goldplated or like have have some type of of gold on them for like $300 at some**52:17**pizza joint right and the reason they're doing it is to get attention for everything else so what I would say is**52:22**you could think about selling a million doll coffee mug and make that your past fail or you could come up with a**52:29**compelling argument for why a coffee mug particular coffee mug should sell for a**52:35**million dollars and then use that as a PR hook to bring attention to everything else that you're doing which is probably**52:42**quite a bit easier but if you do that and someone buys it**52:47**great fantastic you did it you sold one for a million bucks now that said if that is the only**52:55**measure of pass fail then it's it's extremely binary but if you were to use it as a means by which**53:01**you draw attention to everything else that you're doing then I think it's pretty interesting so there you have it have I  <br>**Brazil.53:08**been to Brazil yes I've been to Brazil five or six or seven times actually all over the place in fact uh how big is my  <br>**A small but mighty staff.53:15**staff pretty small few people two three people four yeah something like that**53:21**three or four I guess at this point it's from Husain and Toronto after the 10 th  <br>**Attracting event attendance.53:26**anniversary I tried to organize a Fallout meeting however I had to cancel due to little interest I'll try again at the end of the summer can you think of a**53:31**cost-effective Tim Ferris way to make attendance at these events irresistible**53:37**well you might consider I'm just making this up so this is on the fly but you might consider partnering with another**53:44**organization like EO or YPO or whoever right who might be looking for**53:50**membership and you could say you know I'd love to host this type of event for fans of Tim Ferris or however you want**53:56**phrase it right listeners of the Tim far show or readers of such and such book and perhaps we can do an event**54:04**where they come for free get exposed to these following speakers I think having**54:09**speakers would be helpful so you could try to do that on your own or you could make it more of an**54:17**event right some type of activity so you could do I don't know Tim FIS show**54:22**paintball Extravaganza right get 10 people to go do paintball or something**54:28**who knows right you you have to make it like what are they what are they considering as Alternatives right it's**54:34**kind of like with Molly let's just say my dog Molly I remember at one**54:40**point I was working with this dog trainer and she saw me giving kibble to Molly as the treat just her regular dog**54:47**food but in little pieces and she goes what is that and I was like oh it's kibble she's like oh man she's like**54:52**you're not going to train your dog that way she said it's a crowded bar you got to TI with 20s she's like you're giving**54:57**her [ __ ] you have to have really good treats you have to tip with 20s it's a crowded bar right to compete with**55:04**the squirrels and the dogs and the other stuff the smells so I would say those**55:09**are a few ideas but if you have a small group of friends you could just you could just**55:17**take their temperature with a couple of different options and see how it goes right I mean uh those are a few initial**55:24**thoughts but maybe helpful maybe not Timothy Keen this is visualization or  <br>**Visualization or affirmations?55:30**affirmations I haven't used affirmations much to be honest I don't think actually that's not true with five**55:37**minute journal and things like that kind of these statements like I am or whatever I'll**55:43**also frequently have something like you have plenty of time or there is plenty of time right so that I don't feel**55:51**artificially rushed which never produces great results or great feelings for that matter**55:57**or something like frankly this is true for a lot of people on this Q&A right like you've already won the game you**56:03**speak English you have a computer hopefully you're healthy like**56:09**you've already won the game so just number one like take a breath realize**56:14**there's no game on some level left to win like you've already done it you've already crossed the finish line so**56:19**everything else is gravy so just like take a chill pill and breathe and then for visualiz ation you**56:26**know I use that mostly with athletic stuff uh sometimes if I'm going to get on stage for like a speak engagement**56:32**I'll visualize how it's going to go or I'll run through it visually like just like I have a VR headset on like I'll close my eyes I'm very visual so I'll**56:38**imagine the whole thing walking out sitting in the right chair looking to the audience how I'm going to hold the mic Etc and I'll run through some of**56:45**that as rehearsal let's say those are what come to  <br>**Today I learned this about Hodinkee.56:51**mind yeah check names I didn't realize that hinky was check for watches that's hilarious  <br>**What would this look like if it were easy?56:58**is uh yeah what would this look like if it were easy Cindy question that I still**57:03**ask myself all the time what do I like to ask my this is Victoria ask my fans  <br>**What I ask show listeners when I meet them.57:09**when I meet them I ask who they would like to hear on the podcast you if they could only pick one or two guests and they can't say Elon Musk or some huge**57:15**name no huge names allowed who would you like to have on the podcast that's that's a question I ask and I actually**57:21**have had a lot of those answers translate to guests on the podcast Randy  <br>**Eschewing endorsement remorse.57:26**if we did a fan Meetup would you endorse it or say it's okay I mean this is where I have to be careful about taking on too**57:32**much uh responsibility with these things so probably not because if I did that**57:38**then anyone who's ever hosting a Meetup would come to me for the same thing and it would just create a huge comms problem for me and my my team so I'd**57:45**probably need to be hands off I don't think yeah I mean to have a fan meet**57:51**up I don't think you need my permission uh you know if you're turning into like some crazy business then using**57:58**my name then it turns into a separate thing do I like electronic  <br>**Music I like.58:03**music yes I do I mean I'm pretty old school I mean I listen to shingo Nakamura quite a bit for like chill**58:09**mixes dead mouse pretty old school but I I wrote 4our body to a continuous mix**58:15**like a three-hour set of dead mouse there there's all sorts of stuff but**58:20**it's usually something that's going to give me a fair amount of energy I listen to like lowf beats type stuff when**58:26**writing sometimes if I need something a little downtempo for God knows where listen to a lot of**58:34**like heavy heavy metal when I'm writing oddly enough State story strategy yeah I  <br>**State, story, strategy.58:39**still use State story strategy people can look that up I got that from Tony Robbins I would consider having more  <br>**The (not-so) funny thing about interviewing comedians.58:45**comedians on the podcast but I feel like other people do a better job honestly you know like Rogan there's so many**58:51**comedy podcasts out there I want to differentiate myself in some way that feels authentic to**58:57**me category of one kind of stuff but yes Austin is now a comedy center it's**59:03**pretty wild all right you guys I think that's that's me for now I'm going to get outside and shoot some arrows  <br>**Parting thoughts.59:10**and I really appreciate everyone's time thank you for the hosting first and**59:15**foremost so awesome so fun to see all of these events around the world and would**59:21**love people to stay in touch with anyone they met at those events or look to explore explore see what see what we can**59:28**learn from each other right doesn't have to be limited to anything I talk about you know just find people who have who**59:34**are philosophically values aligned and see what you can learn from each other you know go go for some bike rides or**59:41**something doesn't have to be coffee and Coffee and Wine get out and do something right try something new together anyway**59:48**that would be that would be my my wish for you

And thank you.0:14**first and foremost thanks everybody I really appreciate all the hosting and**0:20**amazing celebrations and going on around the world it was**0:26**super fun for me to be part of and to watch and to participate in so thank you**0:31**very much for all of that and what I thought we would do is bounce back and**0:38**forth between these questions here and I'll**0:44**I'll do improv jav as improv jav improv Jazz as we go through and I'll pick some**0:51**questions and then we will also do some live questions so why don't we start with some live**0:58**questions I'll hop in here and I'll answer as many questions as I can that were presubmit as well RJ from Malaga**1:07**Spain believe it or not I have some ancestors from Malaga Spain one of them was killed in a bull fight so be careful**1:14**with the bull fights all right if you had to pick a topic for your podcast that I'd stick to from now on topic or  <br>**A focus on reinvention.1:21**theme would you pick probably reinvention of different types I think I**1:27**would focus on people who have reinvented themselves instead of sticking with the tried and true Groove**1:32**people who have taken the time or the space or just the attention to step back**1:39**and reexamine their assumptions reexamine the things that have worked up to this point that may not be those**1:46**things directionally that they want to continue pursuing so reinvention I think Kate and Cody how do you think about  <br>**Optimization.1:52**over optimization uh today many of us have the resources to enable us to spend**1:57**countless percentage of our life tweaking and attempting to op optimize every little thing I would say that you**2:03**want to pick very carefully what you choose to optimize as a very dear friend of mine I won't mention him by name**2:09**because you might not like that but very top 1% of 1% in terms of performer put**2:15**it to me he's like you want to be incredibly excellent the best you can be**2:20**in one or two things and then for everything else it's good enough passing grade for everything else**2:26**and he walks that walk and got a great family he's a great husband and father**2:33**he's very good at the things he chooses to optimize and for the rest he's not  <br>**Recent joy.2:39**worried Claudine what has brought me a ton of Joy or fun recently archery I've**2:44**been doing a lot of archery training not sure if you can see my forearms they are all screwed up I was shooting both right**2:51**and left-handed but find that incredibly uh joyful and meditative all right Joel**2:57**Hello Joel our group had so much in common it was so fun everyone wants to stay connected they asked if there might be more opportunities for me to**3:02**facilitate keeping us connected in the future the greatest joy that I got from the parties for the 10th anniversary and**3:09**so on was how many people came together with some shared interests or Curiosities at least who then wanted to**3:17**hang out after the event people who wanted to stay connected that made me super super happy that was really The**3:24**Not So secret agenda all along so that made me really happy and I'd like to explore ways that I can facilitate that**3:30**without having to manage it myself Cindy has a question [ __ ] punch update please  <br>**A CØCKPUNCH update.3:36**yes I have a ton of artwork and a lot of material to share with respect to World**3:42**building and frankly I've let Perfection be the enemy of good I've wanted to**3:48**present all this stuff in this high production value video with all the**3:53**bells and whistles and I've been sitting on this stuff for many months now and uh**3:59**I think that is my perfectionism getting in the way of Simply sharing these things so I have lots of stuff to share**4:08**and I need to get on that I would say in the next few weeks doesn't need to be fancy I feel at this point Expediting is**4:15**more important than optimizing delivery all right oh God worst funniest date I've**4:21**been on yeah we'll need another live chat to cover that Arena how am I today  <br>**How the day’s going so far.4:27**I'm doing really well uh beautiful day here it's a little warm I don't handle heat terribly well I'm going to go shoot**4:32**arrows after this Q&A and hang out with Molly outside I'll have her behind the**4:38**line of fire she's a very good archery dog in that way and uh a little tired**4:43**I'm not sure why I might have a fever I've been training really hard so who knows maybe there's a bug in the food or**4:49**something I've been very tired today it's unclear why cuz I got plenty of sleep um so that's how I am today but**4:55**happy to be doing the Q&A this is from Andre Andy from bu say what place does  <br>**Argentina affection.5:01**Argentina occupy in my heart today and why well I have deep affection for Argentina and the RGS and I would like**5:08**to get back down there honestly I recently for the first time in 20 years basically went to a Tango Festival in**5:16**Austin so I bought new shoes I didn't even have shoes I haven't done Tango in ages and I've forgotten 99% of it which**5:23**is very painful for me but had a blast just had so much fun there's nothing like it so I think at some point it's**5:30**possible I'll go back to Argentina and do 3 to four weeks full immersion tons of Tango lots of steak and probably lots**5:38**of malbeck at the same time uh so I would say I'm I'm very eager to get down**5:44**there revisit it learn of the current events and leadership in particular in**5:49**Argentina which I find very interesting and we'll go from there what type of business/ investment is the most  <br>**Intriguing investments.5:56**exciting for me right now anything that is aligned I'd say and this isn't an invitation for pitches but anything**6:02**that's really aligned with my the sort of ethos that I might**6:09**be looking to incorporate more in my life so for instance Maui neie venison from an ecological perspective from a**6:16**Founder perspective husband and wife team incredibly high integrity beautiful**6:22**family beautiful people and also very good operators it's a good business but**6:27**it's also doing a lot for or the sort of native ecosystem in Hawaii so that'd be**6:35**an example of something that's I feel very aligned with even though it's not the kind of tech multiples that we would be used to in potential outcomes**6:42**something I feel very good about also very involved with quite a bit of climate work and let's just call it**6:48**technology intended to help with many of the extreme weather and climate**6:54**challenges that we're going to continue to face top three snacks I'm eating right now  <br>**Top three snacks.7:00**yeah I mean I have Maui Nei right around the corner so the Maui Nei venison sticks and then often it's it's some**7:06**type of mixed nuts minus peanuts and let's say cans of lentils so boring**7:14**but I find that very helpful there are a number of questions about AI I would say  <br>**AI thoughts.7:19**I largely feel unqualified to have strong opinions about this but if I**7:26**invest and I've invested in one or two AI SP focused**7:31**companies they're very Niche and they have some type of at least intermediate**7:38**term defensible mode a lot of the AI stuff that's trained on publicly**7:44**available data is just going to get cloned as soon as it shows any traction and uh as some people may have noticed a**7:51**lot of stuff that was web 3 at one point those people have now pivoted into Ai**7:56**and I'm I'm trying to be cautious of anything that is kind of the investment**8:02**sector dour and there's still interesting things in web 3 although I think**8:07**blockchain is probably a better way to put it and they're very interesting things in AI but I like to invest in**8:14**what I know where I think I have an informational advantage and I do not think I have an informational Advantage**8:20**with AI question on on a few different things I'll pick two of these on Modern dating as a public figure how do you  <br>**Modern dating.8:26**navigate the complexities of modern da I would say slowly and very carefully**8:32**what qualities do I look for in a partner to ensure a meaningful and sustainable relationship well first and foremost I would say the the smaller the**8:39**social media footprint the more comfortable I am but it also makes it very hard to find people if they're not online since it's not like I'm going out**8:46**to bars and just doing cold approaches so I would say uh**8:52**discretion someone who prefers a certain degree of privacy those are those are all indicators for me and in the**8:59**positive direction for trustworthiness I recognize a lot of people live online so that's just the**9:05**nature of our current day but I look for those things a demonstrated ability to**9:11**do hard things over longer periods of time I want to know that life isn't always hard for someone so if they're**9:17**able to focus on let's just say higher education for four years at a demanding**9:24**University that doesn't automatically make them a Super Genius who's perfect for me but it shows probably they're**9:29**able to focus on on certain things that are challenging for extended periods of time same thing if they've been at jobs**9:35**for at least some jobs for more than one or two years if it's constantly Lily Pad**9:42**hopping all over the place I don't find that to always mean someone is very**9:49**resilient when things get hard and things always get hard at some point so**9:54**those are a few then there's all the stuff you could guess you know beautiful feminine all that stuff uh but I would**10:03**say those are those are a few also someone who has an identity where they feel confident in having done hard**10:10**things that's the other benefit of I would say people who have done something objectively to the extent that**10:17**it's possible difficult is they have a certain confidence that helps the whole relationship right I feel like you need**10:24**to have a certain identity confidence in your own own ability and skills and selfhood**10:32**self-authoring before you can really be a good partner I think that's I think**10:37**that's the case as best I can tell but I'm I don't think I'm the last person**10:42**you would want relationship advice from but let's wait until I have it a little more figured out on self-experimentation  <br>**Self-experimentation to come.10:48**you're known as using yourself as a guinea pig what are the next five things I'm planning to experiment with uh I'll**10:54**probably get back on look I I don't do as much crazy experimentation as I used to I am looking at some regenerative**11:01**medicine protocols uh possibly for helping inflammation and some of the lower back stuff which is greatly**11:07**improved since I started doing a few things but the jury is still out so I'm not going to get into that yet I don't want to make any prescriptive**11:14**recommendations until I've really tested things and uh archery training bunch of new types of archery training that I'm**11:20**excited to play around with and uh beyond that really a lot of it is just**11:27**putting in the work with things that I believe will be high leverage like working**11:33**on hips internal and external rotation and a few other things that I think**11:38**directly contribute to overall core and low**11:44**back functionality for lack of a better way to put it but nothing crazy in my**11:50**opinion uh some of the medical stuff people might think is crazy but it's it's pretty pretty solid research that's**11:57**backing this stuff you know 10 to 20 years of research search so I don't I don't feel like it's high risk what risks have I taken in the last 10 years  <br>**Analyzing the past decade’s risks.12:03**that have really paid off are there any that did not pay off well you know the**12:08**podcast we could look at as a risk but risk for me is a very specific thing so**12:14**when people say this is risky this isn't risky I think definitions matter a lot for me risk is the potential of an**12:22**irreversible negative outcome very few things fall in that category so the podcast was very off the**12:28**beaten path for me but I didn't view it as risky because I could always stop doing it I could always just hit cancel**12:35**it was low cost to get started I enjoyed the process so the outcome wasn't the**12:40**only measure of success for me and uh that was quite a Divergence**12:46**that paid off certainly paid off I would say that I've made some good investment**12:52**calls and I've made some bad investment calls so the good ones fortunately make up more than make up for the the bad**12:59**ones but with let's just say web 3 as an example I went very heavy and hard into**13:05**a lot of web 3 and put money into a bunch of different funds and various things uh cockp punch as an nft project**13:12**was successful and I set expectations I think properly at the beginning uh if you go back and read that fq like I've**13:18**delivered on all of those and I'm going to deliver continually beyond that I have a lot more to share and everyone**13:24**else has run for the not everyone else but pretty much everyone else has run for the Hills and they're like forget**13:29**about all that no no forget about all that sleep sleep they don't want anybody to remember I don't mind at all because**13:36**I didn't I took all those proceeds and donated to the foundation the foundation Cay Foundation is going to do some**13:42**amazing work with the whatever it ended up being $2 million or something maybe a little bit**13:47**more so a lot of good will come of that and it was a huge creative Catalyst for**13:54**me and I think that without that I wouldn't be working on a new book**14:00**project right now as an example so it it checked all the boxes in terms of its objectives but as a sector I would say**14:08**uh took a took a lot of huge hits on that one and you live and learn you know I**14:14**wasn't playing with money I couldn't afford to lose but it was it was enough that it was very painful so there's an**14:21**experiment that didn't pan out but there's a reason they call them experiments and not**14:27**guarantees uh but yeah you got to choose your bet sizing properly so you don't put yourself in a bad situation all right so**14:35**that risks that it paid off that was from Rebecca Andre currently in a moment where I  <br>**Outthinking a career bottleneck.14:40**don't know what to do professionally have you had those moments yeah right now I'm not sure not sure what I want to**14:46**be when I grow up and uh some days it's really stressful to be honest which sounds silly I know but it is I like**14:53**having a plan I like executing to plan so the book is really the only**14:58**thing that is in my sights at the moment that uh looks clear otherwise what I'm**15:06**doing my best to do is try a lot of little things little experiments expose**15:12**myself to new people have couple of exploratory conversations a week or read**15:19**things listen to things I wouldn't usually read or listen to and have confidence because I've figured it out**15:26**multiple times in the past that I will figure it out again I don't need to fog myself unnecessarily I've yet to find**15:33**that helpful so that may not be super tactical at this point but that's that's**15:40**what I've been telling myself on my good days when I'm not beating the [ __ ] out of myself in my own head David what is  <br>**My current big project.15:45**your current next project that I'm excited about how are you approaching it differently so this is I say the new**15:53**book I'm actually being much more collaborative with this book than I have in the past and that that's proving to**15:59**be a godsend because I have people to bounce things off of and to interact with it's just psychologically I think**16:07**much healthier at least at this point in my life than being a lone wolf on these**16:12**projects because Lone Wolf it's not a thing by the way like look at nature no Lone Wolf survives doesn't**16:18**work so I'm uh using that as a broad way to experiment and by the way [ __ ] punch**16:25**was a precursor to that because I worked really well with what you guys will see soon with the concept art and a lot of**16:32**the collaborative writing that was done and it was awesome it was a great process really had fun it wasn't just**16:38**locking myself in a cave like I'm in solitary confinement and that is what I'm trying**16:45**to emulate also in the uh writing of this new book so we'll see I mean I have**16:52**about four or 500 pages drafted so it's going to be it's going to be another big**16:57**one but you know that's what I do have you experimented with peptides I  <br>**Peptides.17:03**experimented with uh is it BMP 157 or bpc 157 like 12 years ago long time ago**17:10**so I am at a date with peptides but I did experiment way back in the**17:16**day but I really need to educate myself before I can have any thoughts on that**17:21**whatsoever and by the way just as a quick aside with anyone online if they  <br>**Be wary of high conviction.17:27**only have high conviction statements if they really speak confidently all the time be very wary of those**17:34**people people who are being honest should say I have no [ __ ] idea all the time or they should say you know**17:41**what I'm not really sure I need to educate myself everyone online should have that**17:46**response a lot if they don't then you're not going to be able to separate out the real from the fake because they're saying everything with the same high**17:52**level of conviction be really careful about that what mindfulness practices do I use to prepare for high stakes  <br>**Preparation for high-stakes presentations.17:58**presentation or performances I would say I don't let**18:05**fear make me afraid in the sense that I I really remind myself if you weren't**18:12**nervous right then it would be a bigger problem it is normal to be nervous**18:17**before you go up like my hands are shaking a little bit I've done these things hundreds of times and I still get nervous I still get sweaty I still drink**18:24**too much Diet Coke or coffee or whatever beforehand as a ritual which just makes me more shaky obviously and it's like**18:32**it's okay it's fine like anyone who's going out to perform at a high level or attempting to do it at a high level is**18:39**going to be nervous so just use it like Mike Tyson would puke before he went on stage well on stage in the ring Dean**18:45**Martin used to puke before he went on stage I mean these These are legends right I'm not saying you want to emulate everything about them but these are**18:51**people who are at the top of their field so it's okay for them it's okay for you so I just remind myself of that and and**18:59**I will rehearse my ass off there's no mental trick you can do beforehand if you haven't prepared and for me the**19:07**preparation is the mindfulness practice I mean with my TED talk like I rehearsed**19:12**it so many times into voice memo on my phone walking around I mean hundreds of times so by the time I got to the day of**19:20**the presentation on the main stage of Ted I was like well I've put in the time**19:26**the deliberate practice I've done everything I can do so I am as prepared**19:31**as I will ever be so let it rip let's see what happens uh I'd say that's**19:37**that's the mindfulness practice I thought about doing content more geared at kids  <br>**Kid stuff?19:43**teens yeah I've thought about that I thought about it I'm not sure what the best venue is but I am going to be doing**19:49**some experimentation for students probably older students though kind of University or business school  <br>**Getting the most out of a Tim Ferriss meetup.19:56**level what am I looking to get out of the TF meetups and how can we help how can you help you know that was a**20:03**question so if some folks have asked like what question came up a lot some of the questions are just like hey how's it going because the interactions are so**20:10**short they're like hey how's it going um you know where you where are you where do you want to go and then we'd run out**20:15**of time but one of the questions was like how can we be helpful to you and my answer was and is now connect with**20:23**like-minded people do stuff in real life and this ties into AI it's like if if**20:28**you want to if you want to I think harness your**20:36**Humanity do stuff in real life like meet people man because the Poison's coming**20:42**in terms of information delus it's going to 10x in the next 10 to 18 months and**20:48**most minds and habits are not going to be ready for that I think it's**20:54**impossible to be ready but to be more resilient I would just say do more in real life like connect with like-minded**21:00**people try to do meetups you can do Zoom or something like that if you can't do**21:06**live but like really seek out your tribe and if those people happen to overlap with the people**21:12**who came to the meetups which was my hope then great like you just connected with a bunch of people who might**21:21**be of kind of similar similar tribe so I would say I would say do that will I  <br>**In-person conferences planned?21:27**plan any iners some conferences I don't have any plans right this moment um Joel I see your note on IBS I don't have a  <br>**IBS relief.21:34**lot of thoughts on IBS I apologize I just don't know much about it uh I mean you what you could do and I**21:41**don't know if this will work but I mean you could just use like metamol citrus cell beforehand I mean it does slow**21:47**gastric emptying and it does also reduce glycemic index so if you're going to eat a meal you know it's going to spike your**21:52**glycemic index side note you can take like five of these capsules with uh fiber just a slow things down so that**21:59**the release isn't as intense uh so but I'm not a doctor I try not to pretend to**22:05**be one on the internet but I I really don't know much about IBS unfortunately but I'm looking at**22:13**anti-inflammatory protocols that could have an effect on this type of issue but I haven't looked at it well**22:19**enough so I don't want to give you any opinions what are some of my heresies um I mean I think a heresy that  <br>**Personal heresies.22:27**I have is just I think a lot of what we try to do**22:32**in Modern Life is a very new experiment right so I think if we look back at**22:38**older societies and they're not all rose-colored right it's it's very**22:44**seductive to look back at indigenous group X Y or Z and say oh you know they had it all figured out they were in tune**22:49**with nature and it's like well if you go back you also very often even now see**22:55**domestic abuse and lots of alcoholism other issues so it's it's not ever perfect anywhere but I would say if we**23:03**look at what gives people meaning I think we've been LED astray**23:08**with a lot of kind of brainwashing and theory that doesn't map very well to**23:17**anthropological study or really just common behaviors that you see around the world that seem to have some durability**23:24**and Nasim Talib talks about this a lot so I would just say broadly thinking**23:30**that in a lot of ways individually just in terms of like rugged individualism**23:36**we've gone off track a bit and**23:41**that a lot of the I'd say common ways that we plan our careers and lives are**23:48**actually at odds with ultimately what's going to give us fulfillment I would say can unpack that more another time so a  <br>**What makes conferences worthwhile for me?23:55**couple people asking about conferences maybe maybe at some point I'll do a conference it would be quite small you**24:00**know it wouldn't be more than 200 people so if I ever did it it's a lot of work frankly and when I did it last time it**24:09**was basically not for profit because I spent so much money on the quality of the event so I don't know I'm I'm not**24:16**sure I have the energy to do it as a nonprofit and if it were not to be a nonprofit it would just be stupidly**24:21**expensive it would be like 30 grand a person or something obscene which I would feel kind of silly  <br>**Longevity and healthspan.24:28**putting out there how realistic is it to consider the health span possibility RJ**24:33**to get to 150 years old in good health I'm not really sure how to evaluate this to be honest I I'm more focused these**24:40**days on experiential lifespan and trying to harness and I've spoken about this**24:46**before but trying to organize events Gatherings of**24:53**friends in some cases very intense physical experiences like long difficult**24:58**hikes or pilgrimage trails with people I really care for to basically pack a few**25:05**months into say a week at a time I think that's a reliable actionable way to extend your**25:12**experiential lifespan right to feel like you've basically packed 150 years into your let's say 85 uh most attempts at**25:23**extending longevity in any meaningful way have all failed to date right and maybe we are in**25:29**fact at this cusp of all these Amazing Discoveries that will lead us to live a really long time maybe that's Rapa maybe**25:35**that's some type of Tim restricted feeding maybe that is fall of Statin maybe it's who the [ __ ] knows you know**25:43**there's always something there's always some new ponon Fountain of Youth that**25:48**people have found especially on the internet I'm not super bullish on that stuff here's the thing I would say for**25:55**myself they're likely to fail so I would rather have low expectations and be pleasantly surprised later than to take**26:03**all of these things and suffer what will most definitely be significant side effects**26:10**that we haven't foreseen with a lot of this new stuff so like fall stat for instance like it basically cripples FSH and**26:18**animal models so it's like do you really want to be infertile uh can you reverse that after the fact like yeah great you**26:24**have eight pack and you look younger than you did 8 weeks ago but now your balls don't work so I'm not ready to**26:31**make that trade you know maybe after I have three or four kids sure but uh I would just be very careful with that**26:37**kind of stuff so 150 I mean if we're talking about that in the next you know**26:44**basically putting people on a Glide path that will land them there in the next 10 to 15 years I'm pretty skeptical I mean**26:50**especially with increases in environmental toxins and other issues that will besiege Humanity over the next**26:57**10 to 20 years certainly I mean more weather issues forc migrations all sorts of [ __ ] um I'm not dystopian about it**27:06**but I'm not it should tell you something that I'm not about my personal beliefs at**27:12**least that I'm not doing a lot of that stuff yeah I mean if you account for infant mortality and antibiotics and**27:19**then you look at say my entire family history on both sides it's like yeah males tend to die around 85 that's just**27:25**the way it goes so I would love to live longer but I'm not going to take a lot of**27:31**unnecessary risks where I see significant potential downside so long answer I'm interested in it for sure**27:38**like I track some of the science Andy Bruce any tips on walk in the Kumo cot though taking your 11-year-old son with  <br>**Tips for a father-and-son Kumano Kodo walk.27:44**you that's cool that's fun uh there are a million different ways to walk this pilgrimage Trail in Japan which is the**27:52**sister Trail of the commo de Santiago in Europe there's the only two**27:58**world heritage pilgrimage Trails so there are like a thousand different ways you can do the kumoko it's like a**28:05**tributaries that then filter down to the main Shrine and Temple because they**28:12**basically took like Shinto mapping and then put Buddhism on top of it I would**28:17**pick one that crosses rivers and water if you can that's just really Pleasant feature when you're hauling ass and**28:24**getting really sweaty and so on bring walking sticks for sure like poles**28:31**especially for the downhill you'll be walking on Rock a lot it's very hard on the joints so nice thick heels you know**28:39**hoca shoes or something like that I would suggest like you will feel it in**28:44**your ankles and your knees and uh you know my thought is if you're going to do something longer because some people**28:51**will do like a week at a time or 10 days at a time you could spend months on the K codo is do a little bit less than you**28:59**think you can each day like don't push it super hard because you may be then handicapped the next day if your knee**29:04**really bothers you you're not going to you're not going to want to put a lot of weight on that for the next 10**29:10**kilometers or 20 kilom right so I'd do a little bit less than you think you can each day something about the Tweet of  <br>**A barbell distribution approach to life.29:17**the kettle B swings is King of the exercise where else can you find the king of X could be relationships Finance**29:22**anything I think you I think a lot about barbell approaches to life so for**29:28**instance like highrisk Angel Investing and then like mun bonds as boring and as stable as you get right so it's kind of**29:34**one or the other like highrisk high return with small amounts of money or**29:40**very stable predictable boring and not playing in the middle as soon as you start playing**29:46**in the middle you're like I'm going to play with tech growth stocks da da and then you at least in my experience**29:52**that's how you get your face ripped off or that's how I get I get my face ripped off so I think about barbell distributions a lot in physical Fitness**29:58**and finance and everywhere aside from Richard Fineman if I could bring back one person from the dead for a podcast  <br>**Who would I resurrect for a podcast interview?30:05**episode who would it be oh man there's so many right I'm tempted to say like Marcus Aurelius or something but Sena**30:13**who knows I mean probably senica because I've just read so much of his stuff and I'm curious if I would find the guy to be an arrogant prick or what the vibe**30:21**would be in person right assuming we're speaking the same language I would be super curious about senica he gets a**30:27**very mixed review but I mean I'm once again listening to an audio book uh on anger or Ona**30:34**Ira I mean his writing is amazing the guy's writing is amazing but what would he be like in person would I be like oh**30:41**yeah this is the uncle who talks too much God this guy's longwinded maybe Ben Franklin I'd be interested very**30:47**interested in um those are a few that come to mind I mean I I could come up with 100 more for sure but those are**30:54**those are two off the top of my head do I have any mentors that I contact regularly for Life advice this is from  <br>**Do I consult any mentors regularly?30:59**Jeff I found in midlife that I really missed out on having fatherly mentors in my 20s and 30s yeah there are I talked**31:05**to uh one this morning in fact he's uh early 70s very**31:11**healthy really takes care of himself great marriage close to his kids and I think he has grandkids now and so we did**31:18**a check-in for about an hour today caught up and this is a good reminder for me to do**31:25**that more often so I do feel I do feel good good about that Paula what are my  <br>**Ayahuasca and antidepressants.31:30**thoughts on iasa on anti-depressants you've been doing iwaska for 13 years only just started taking anti-depressants unsure if I**31:37**should mix both this is from Brazil you need to be very very very careful so IA**31:44**plus certain anti-depressants like ssris can cause a potentially fatal serotonin**31:49**syndrome so you need to be very very very careful with that so I would**31:55**absolutely speak with doctors about that I not mix them until you get the go ahead from doctors and I I imagine a**32:02**psychiatrist who prescribe the anti-depressants I'd be very careful with that iasa is one of the one of the**32:08**riskier compounds at least of the let's call it classically known psychedelics with respect to combining**32:14**with anti-depressants so I'd be very careful with that and side note I learned not too long ago that people who**32:21**were taking Lithium should really not screw around with psychedelics a lot of Adverse Events**32:27**been reported at least with some of the classical let's just call it not not entirely tryptamine but LSD**32:35**psilocybin Etc so if you're taking higher doses of of lithium now there's some there are some ways that could be**32:43**conflated because of people are taking lithium what are they taking it for they might be taking it for any number of conditions that would be contraindicated**32:48**with psychedelics in the first place so who knows but uh I wouldn't mix lithium**32:54**with these things either how can you incentivize someone to Mentor you I'm not sure how to do that I mean I I think  <br>**Incentivizing potential mentors.33:01**you need to be a really good student number one he said no money possible I mean frankly I pay I pay for it a lot I**33:08**mean I have friends who learn from me and I learn from them and they're older than I am and I consider them**33:14**mentors but at the end of the day I actually find it in some ways cleaner to**33:20**just pay someone and uh if you wanted to get mentorship that isn't expensive like**33:26**maybe you go to Toastmaster or you join the EO like entrepreneurs organization**33:32**or YPO depends on what you're looking for but like mentors don't need to be expensive at all you know I have a**33:38**mentor in archery and he's also kind of a mental performance coach doesn't need**33:43**to break the bank so I would say you know you can go to your local YMCA and find a coach in some Sport and if**33:50**they're good at all at anything they will have life lessons for you especially if they're a bit older so I**33:57**would say that my advice for the moment do I babysit sometimes for some of my friends uh I mean not really  <br>**Adventures in babysitting.34:04**babysit but like I'll watch their kids for a little bit or watch a Disney movie with their kids like young kids uh how**34:10**did I find it I think I look I think I'm a kid at heart so for me animals and kids are I don't want to**34:17**say easy but especially if they're little I find them pretty easy I think**34:24**when if I have kids which is the Hope at least if they get to the point where they're like**34:31**petulant kind of like mean-spirited um kids where they're just**34:37**being [ __ ] I think I'll have a hard time with that I think I will have a hard time once they like know which buttons they're pushing and they're just**34:43**like drilling it in that I'm going to have trouble with but like little kids who just like are disregulated and lose**34:49**their [ __ ] because they haven't developed their prefrontal cortex like yeah like I can I can deal with that**34:55**pretty well my opinion of this is from Judy  <br>**GLP-1 for depression/anxiety.35:00**glp1 medications this would be like munaro or OIC uh glp want agonists believe they're**35:08**in clinical trials now for depression anxiety yeah I haven't looked at them specifically for that did put up a blog**35:14**post recently from Johan Hari on glp1 specifically so if you want to get some**35:20**of the science and also a firsthand report of that I would uh just go on tim. blog and search Johan J n n last**35:28**name Har h a r i all right so this piece of artwork you know people love this I  <br>**Cheap but choice art.35:34**love it too I bought this for $80 at an antique Warehouse in the middle of**35:40**nowhere I saw it and I just loved it and grabbed it I love it every time I see it**35:47**maybe it was less 60 60 bucks 80 bucks at an antique Warehouse yeah it's one of**35:52**my favorite pieces of art that's a turkey tail below it a lot of turkeys around here**35:59**uh or not tail turkey feather for agents book agents and stuff uh last time I  <br>**Finding a book agent.36:05**checked which was a long time ago Publishers Marketplace is a great place to look also find books that are kind of**36:10**in the same category or vein as yours look at the acknowledgements and you'll very often see the agent there then you**36:17**can reach out to them directly through something like Publishers Marketplace or these days a lot of these agents or agencies have their own websites  <br>**Making positive, in-person connections.36:23**thoughts on how to approach making some great in-person connections yeah I would look at my talk I gave it South by Southwest which had the title how to**36:31**build a worldclass network in record time something click baity like that but it actually delivers uh I would check**36:38**that out all right this is from Dolan Dolan okay the last set was from Claudine thank you for those this one's  <br>**Unmentioned things I’d like to talk about.36:45**from Dolan if I'm pronouncing that correctly basically anything that I would like to talk about that I haven't**36:51**had an opportunity to talk about yet for instance my interest SL journey in connecting with animals and nature maybe**36:56**some insights for my personal exploration of psychedelic and non-ordinary states of Consciousness over the last 10 years so I**37:05**have probably a thousand pages of notes on all this and at some point I feel**37:11**like that might be the most important book that I write but it's going to be it's going to be a lot to put it**37:17**together so in a way the book I'm doing now where I'm collaborating is sort of a possible warm-up for that because I I**37:23**don't think it's a book that I would want to do by myself it would just be such a heavy lift**37:28**and uh yeah we'll see we shall see but I**37:34**think if I if I talk about that at some huge length it'll probably be in a book I'd want to think about it because it'll**37:40**get so strange it will get so unbelievably strange number one first all the**37:47**scientific regulatory kind of on the radar above the line**37:56**logistical stuff that I want to handle in the Psychedelic Therapeutics world I want to handle first because if I ever**38:03**write this book it is going to get so weird that at least 20% of the people**38:08**who read it are going to think I'm completely insane it'll just be so strange I wouldn't want it to damage my**38:16**current credibility that I have to get things done in those worlds and U**38:21**including some of the stuff with animals man it gets I mean if you talk to people who've**38:28**like been in this stuff for let's just say culturally for**38:33**hundreds or thousands of years it's not weird but to most folks it's going to sound pretty [ __ ] weird which I get**38:40**excited about but I'm going to wait until I'm like you know what I don't give a [ __ ] what anyone thinks cuz it's not going to interrupt anything else**38:46**that I'm doing I don't care then maybe that book but it's going to be a little while this is from  <br>**Is there room for the irrational?38:51**andrece all right so it's a it's a longer let's see here I'll paraphrase**38:57**here basically I'm very rational and methodical about decision-making and so on rational approach is admirable but**39:04**sometimes being a rational or spontaneous can inject a lot of energy and fun have I found space for**39:09**rationality to play a role in my life the irrational and emotional for decisions and if so have they ever led**39:17**me to alter my wellth thought out plans for the year so I would say yes I don't**39:22**know if IR rational it would be the word I would use Maybe because you have**39:28**like let's take moral I don't know what the proper word would be here but you have you have moral behaviors you have**39:35**immoral behaviors and let's just call those nonmoral behaviors then you have amoral behaviors that are kind of like**39:42**in this no man's land so I would say if you have like rational**39:47**rational irrational the opposite then there's like irrational I don't think that's a word but somewhere in the**39:54**middle where it's like it's it's not it's not driven by Logic it's driven**39:59**more by feeling I'm doing more and more of that these days for sure I mean our sort of**40:07**evolved system here with lots of valuable apparatus for navigating**40:14**reality predates Language by at least this kind of language by millions of years so uh**40:22**yes I found space for that although I'd be very careful about I see this quite a**40:27**bit in Austin and places like it where there's this like Neo new Agy stuff**40:33**where people are like I'm just using my intuition and I think very often that is**40:39**used for people used by people who just want a justification for doing what they want to do or doing something that is**40:46**easier than the hard thing and they're like well I'm just using my intuition right intuition is interesting to me**40:51**when it points you in a direction you didn't expect right where let just say**40:57**you go on a date and on paper they're perfect and you're like I'm going to love this person and then you meet them and you're**41:03**like something's a little weird here like I want to like them but this isn't right that's where intuition is valuable**41:10**right or like a business deal everything looks perfect and then there's something about it like uh my gut just doesn't**41:16**feel right that's where intuition is interesting if you're like this all looks perfect on paper and you know what**41:23**even though all my friends are telling me it's a terrible investment my intuition tells me to do it like that's where I'd be like well like wait a**41:29**minute here is this just confirmation bias what are my thoughts on blogging in  <br>**Blogging in the age of AI.41:35**the age of AI I mean look AI is amazing it's really incredible but writing for**41:41**me is a way of clarifying my own thinking and I do think that taking the time to craft words without the**41:47**assistance of AI is helpful I might use AI to get past the blank page but I**41:52**think it's seductive as a drug and just like most people people can't tell**41:58**Direction without Google Maps now I think it's it's very possible almost inevitable that people will lose certain**42:05**faculties that they currently have by overusing AI so uh we shall see but I**42:12**plan on doing more writing to the oldfashioned way I have not used binaural beats I am very interested in  <br>**Binaural beats.42:20**that and actually just reminded me somebody owes me something on binaural beats so if you have any recommendations**42:28**for what types of binaural beads let me know forour dog training yeah maybe  <br>**4-Hour Dog Training?42:35**Never Say Never best thousand I spent lately I mean it was more than that but on the archery training it's always  <br>**Best $1,000 spent lately.42:42**something like that it's very rarely stuff I mean sometimes it's stuff like there's**42:49**a I bought an extra soite PSO RIT and a mini Rumble roller that I**42:59**can travel with and those have been amazing for just like rolling out my**43:06**glutes and per foris and my legs and stuff before bed really helps with sleep a lot but that's like I don't know 100**43:14**bucks 150 um I buy very well I try to buy very little stuff**43:21**it just ends up causing me more stress as clutter around my house than the value that it adds so so I try to get**43:27**rid of a lot of stuff good question of the was the last $1,000 worth of clutter**43:32**that gave me the most relief when I gave it away that's what I should think about am I aware of Javier M I think that's  <br>**Javier Milei.43:39**how you say his name in Argentina I am I've actually listened to some of his speeches pretty interesting stuff I**43:44**don't know enough about them but a number of my friends are are big fans so need to do more research best thing that  <br>**Best thing I spent an “assload” on.43:51**I spent an ass load on uh what's the best thing I spent an ass load on not to get too technical would be a family trip**43:58**I took my parents and brother and his wife on a trip around Europe and um that**44:04**was definitely an assload of cash but I think that was a good good investment and um I would recommend everyone read**44:10**something called The Tail End by Tim Urban that is a good investment of time**44:16**it's very short do I like painting not sketching as a hobby I haven't learned  <br>**Painting.44:21**how to paint I would like to dabble in ideally watercolor I think think but do  <br>**10–20 minutes on the acupuncture mat.44:28**I have any quick tips for getting up to 10 to 20 minutes on the acupuncture mat yeah that's for people who are curious**44:36**the naoya ACU pressure mat I think or other there are a lot of imitations that**44:42**I'm sure just as just as good I don't go to 20 minutes typically but like 10 to**44:48**15 if I'm going to do it the first three minutes are going to be torer so you just have to get through the first like 3 to four minutes is my**44:55**experience otherwise I don't have I don't have much to tell you it can be it can be pretty  <br>**Dating apps.45:01**intense thoughts on dating apps oh man this is like Warren Buffett covering his**45:08**eyes and like pointing towards Wall Street because half the people are going to have terrible experiences uh I don't know to be frank**45:16**I mean I I think hinge has been one of the better options so far I think that**45:22**in terms of just quality people have to pass some hurdles and add some information uh the league is pretty interesting also**45:29**because you can search by interest which is so critical I don't know why you can't do it on any other app but you can**45:35**search for like skiing or whatever to find somebody who has similar interests but the league is really only effective**45:41**in certain cities it's not used widely everywhere but like in a place like New York City or LA or whatever you could**45:47**find people who are pretty well educated interesting uh but a downside is people**45:52**tend not to use it that frequently so you might have a great match and they don't see your message for 6 months**45:59**so go figure it's a jungle out there folks be careful and there are a lot of**46:04**people catfishing so watch out for that too do a video call before you meet up with someone what's my favorite science  <br>**Favorite sci-fi movies.46:11**fiction movie and why big fan of the second Dune movie frankly uh ex bakina I**46:17**remember really enjoying there are a lot of great science fiction movies I think her was fantastic and you know at the time it seemed insane and it's basically**46:25**already there if you look at get the latest editions of chat GPT and so on**46:30**things like replica with a K replica uh yeah her is basically already here it's**46:37**pretty nuts with questions about [ __ ] punch it'll it'll be more interesting once I release the rest of the stuff or**46:45**a bunch of it then you'll have a lot more to chew on and I'll give you a foreshadowing it's not really a**46:50**foreshadowing it is a statement that I hope is a statement of fact and that is I will have some some fan writing**46:57**competitions like elimination competitions and so that**47:02**will reward people who really dig into the details they'll also have to be decent writing of course Claudine have I  <br>**Reflecting on the impact this show has had on others.47:11**let the enormity of 10 years of TFS really land not just from a metrics POV but from a positive kindness deepening**47:17**Etc human level it's been such a Force for good and lighten this world thank you Claud and that's very kind of you to**47:22**say I would say that I I did**47:27**when the celebrations were happening but I could do a better job I could do a**47:33**better job of sitting with that so thank you for the reminder it's easy for me to**47:39**just like move on like yeah yeah good job but like you just did your job so don't get too happy with yourself and**47:45**like what's next what's next right like yeah you did your job and that's fine but like don't get too**47:52**smug about it or self-satisfied but I find that pretty that can be very self-defeating right so I did take time**47:58**to celebrate for the 10th anniversary and I had a great time the inperson meet up in Paris was great and it was really**48:04**fun to in person hear the stories from people who are deeply affected by the podcast so thank you for the reminder I**48:11**will I will um I will take a moment today to revisit that thank**48:17**you I should travel to meet girls well I mean why was I in Europe for 6 to8 weeks  <br>**Why was I in Europe for six to eight weeks?48:23**uh who knows maybe it was related to that is it possible that my mood improved during this Q&A yeah it's  <br>**The mood-altering effects of Q&A.48:29**entirely possible I was exhausted guys I'm not going to lie at the beginning of this but I enjoy these interactions so**48:36**it is certainly possible that my mood improved as a function of my energy going up so thanks for that everybody  <br>**Where do I see myself in 30 years?48:43**where do I see myself in 30 years good Lord I don't know hopefully not six feet under we'll see I'll be 30 years I'll be**48:52**40 no 76 77 [ __ ] so I don't know**48:57**hopefully I'll be doing Black Diamond skiing because uh we found the Fountain of Youth have you suggested a workout  <br>**Workout routines for older parents.49:04**routine this is mags for my parents if not what would it potentially look like how would you approach it yeah I would**49:10**say super slow protocol look up Ken Hutchins and the super slow protocol and**49:16**uh yeah my dad's lost I don't know 80 lbs like let's call it 40 kilos in the last year so he's**49:23**made a lot of progress that's slow carb diet it's a straightforward from four our body and then super slow as applied**49:32**so super slow in in very basic terms is minimum 5 Seconds up 5 Seconds down so if you're doing a pressing movement five**49:39**seconds slow right up five seconds down one set one set to concentric**49:46**failure uh could be even slower could be 10 seconds up 10 seconds down but**49:51**especially in elderly quite effective for building muscle mass and increasing bone density without injury so that is**49:59**probably what I would I mean that's what I prescribed to my parents that plus walking to the extent**50:06**that it's possible Right Kind of barbell once again with slow carb diet is the glue that holds everything together how  <br>**How I walk and talk for podcasts.50:13**do I record a podcast while walking this right here this**50:22**is atm50x it's an Audio Technica headset it's has**50:29**a USBC attachment plug that into your iPhone and then you can use Riverside or some other app there are a lot of**50:36**different ways to record this is from Mariana over the years I've followed and learned from you  <br>**Would I consider becoming a single parent?50:41**and your guest I've heard you say several times that I'm interested in parenting have you ever considered being a single parent family by choice I too**50:46**for many years was trying to find the perfect partner till I turned 41 and my doctor told me it was time to unfreeze my eggs since I was still single and**50:52**look for the partner decided my best option was to be a single parent so I got a non and ious donor and had my son**50:57**when I was 43 as I'm almost six now we travel the world together could not be happier with the drama-free life we have**51:03**just wishing to see you fulfill your parenting dream and wondered if I would consider this option too yeah I would consider it I would consider it you know**51:10**I think for a long time it was no but I would consider it I would I mean of**51:16**course ideally I would have the partner but I would consider it yeah it's not**51:22**off the table but I'm still fighting the fight getting back into the dating as**51:29**much as I'm just like [ __ ] this is this is a young man's game doing this online dating**51:35**[ __ ] uh frankly just the communications burden is so much G yeah**51:42**so anyway but to answer your question yeah it's on the table for me Joel I see  <br>**A $1 million coffee mug?51:47**yours one of my big goals is to create the world's first coffee mug to sell for more than a million dollars I like that**51:53**I like that as a goal I don't really have a great recommendation for how to chip away at**51:59**it you could look at from a PR perspective at least people who**52:04**have you know sold pieces of the Brooklyn Bridge or sold hamburgers that are like**52:10**goldplated or like have have some type of of gold on them for like $300 at some**52:17**pizza joint right and the reason they're doing it is to get attention for everything else so what I would say is**52:22**you could think about selling a million doll coffee mug and make that your past fail or you could come up with a**52:29**compelling argument for why a coffee mug particular coffee mug should sell for a**52:35**million dollars and then use that as a PR hook to bring attention to everything else that you're doing which is probably**52:42**quite a bit easier but if you do that and someone buys it**52:47**great fantastic you did it you sold one for a million bucks now that said if that is the only**52:55**measure of pass fail then it's it's extremely binary but if you were to use it as a means by which**53:01**you draw attention to everything else that you're doing then I think it's pretty interesting so there you have it have I  <br>**Brazil.53:08**been to Brazil yes I've been to Brazil five or six or seven times actually all over the place in fact uh how big is my  <br>**A small but mighty staff.53:15**staff pretty small few people two three people four yeah something like that**53:21**three or four I guess at this point it's from Husain and Toronto after the 10 th  <br>**Attracting event attendance.53:26**anniversary I tried to organize a Fallout meeting however I had to cancel due to little interest I'll try again at the end of the summer can you think of a**53:31**cost-effective Tim Ferris way to make attendance at these events irresistible**53:37**well you might consider I'm just making this up so this is on the fly but you might consider partnering with another**53:44**organization like EO or YPO or whoever right who might be looking for**53:50**membership and you could say you know I'd love to host this type of event for fans of Tim Ferris or however you want**53:56**phrase it right listeners of the Tim far show or readers of such and such book and perhaps we can do an event**54:04**where they come for free get exposed to these following speakers I think having**54:09**speakers would be helpful so you could try to do that on your own or you could make it more of an**54:17**event right some type of activity so you could do I don't know Tim FIS show**54:22**paintball Extravaganza right get 10 people to go do paintball or something**54:28**who knows right you you have to make it like what are they what are they considering as Alternatives right it's**54:34**kind of like with Molly let's just say my dog Molly I remember at one**54:40**point I was working with this dog trainer and she saw me giving kibble to Molly as the treat just her regular dog**54:47**food but in little pieces and she goes what is that and I was like oh it's kibble she's like oh man she's like**54:52**you're not going to train your dog that way she said it's a crowded bar you got to TI with 20s she's like you're giving**54:57**her [ __ ] you have to have really good treats you have to tip with 20s it's a crowded bar right to compete with**55:04**the squirrels and the dogs and the other stuff the smells so I would say those**55:09**are a few ideas but if you have a small group of friends you could just you could just**55:17**take their temperature with a couple of different options and see how it goes right I mean uh those are a few initial**55:24**thoughts but maybe helpful maybe not Timothy Keen this is visualization or  <br>**Visualization or affirmations?55:30**affirmations I haven't used affirmations much to be honest I don't think actually that's not true with five**55:37**minute journal and things like that kind of these statements like I am or whatever I'll**55:43**also frequently have something like you have plenty of time or there is plenty of time right so that I don't feel**55:51**artificially rushed which never produces great results or great feelings for that matter**55:57**or something like frankly this is true for a lot of people on this Q&A right like you've already won the game you**56:03**speak English you have a computer hopefully you're healthy like**56:09**you've already won the game so just number one like take a breath realize**56:14**there's no game on some level left to win like you've already done it you've already crossed the finish line so**56:19**everything else is gravy so just like take a chill pill and breathe and then for visualiz ation you**56:26**know I use that mostly with athletic stuff uh sometimes if I'm going to get on stage for like a speak engagement**56:32**I'll visualize how it's going to go or I'll run through it visually like just like I have a VR headset on like I'll close my eyes I'm very visual so I'll**56:38**imagine the whole thing walking out sitting in the right chair looking to the audience how I'm going to hold the mic Etc and I'll run through some of**56:45**that as rehearsal let's say those are what come to  <br>**Today I learned this about Hodinkee.56:51**mind yeah check names I didn't realize that hinky was check for watches that's hilarious  <br>**What would this look like if it were easy?56:58**is uh yeah what would this look like if it were easy Cindy question that I still**57:03**ask myself all the time what do I like to ask my this is Victoria ask my fans  <br>**What I ask show listeners when I meet them.57:09**when I meet them I ask who they would like to hear on the podcast you if they could only pick one or two guests and they can't say Elon Musk or some huge**57:15**name no huge names allowed who would you like to have on the podcast that's that's a question I ask and I actually**57:21**have had a lot of those answers translate to guests on the podcast Randy  <br>**Eschewing endorsement remorse.57:26**if we did a fan Meetup would you endorse it or say it's okay I mean this is where I have to be careful about taking on too**57:32**much uh responsibility with these things so probably not because if I did that**57:38**then anyone who's ever hosting a Meetup would come to me for the same thing and it would just create a huge comms problem for me and my my team so I'd**57:45**probably need to be hands off I don't think yeah I mean to have a fan meet**57:51**up I don't think you need my permission uh you know if you're turning into like some crazy business then using**57:58**my name then it turns into a separate thing do I like electronic  <br>**Music I like.58:03**music yes I do I mean I'm pretty old school I mean I listen to shingo Nakamura quite a bit for like chill**58:09**mixes dead mouse pretty old school but I I wrote 4our body to a continuous mix**58:15**like a three-hour set of dead mouse there there's all sorts of stuff but**58:20**it's usually something that's going to give me a fair amount of energy I listen to like lowf beats type stuff when**58:26**writing sometimes if I need something a little downtempo for God knows where listen to a lot of**58:34**like heavy heavy metal when I'm writing oddly enough State story strategy yeah I  <br>**State, story, strategy.58:39**still use State story strategy people can look that up I got that from Tony Robbins I would consider having more  <br>**The (not-so) funny thing about interviewing comedians.58:45**comedians on the podcast but I feel like other people do a better job honestly you know like Rogan there's so many**58:51**comedy podcasts out there I want to differentiate myself in some way that feels authentic to**58:57**me category of one kind of stuff but yes Austin is now a comedy center it's**59:03**pretty wild all right you guys I think that's that's me for now I'm going to get outside and shoot some arrows  <br>**Parting thoughts.59:10**and I really appreciate everyone's time thank you for the hosting first and**59:15**foremost so awesome so fun to see all of these events around the world and would**59:21**love people to stay in touch with anyone they met at those events or look to explore explore see what see what we can**59:28**learn from each other right
