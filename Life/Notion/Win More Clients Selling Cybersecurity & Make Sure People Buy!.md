how do you become the goto  
mssp that is right we are talking about  
cyber security in this video but not so  
much how to sell it right that was last  
video this video I want to talk about  
how you can position your company to be  
the authority when it comes to cybercity  
especially for your Market how are you  
guys my name is Harrison Baron from  
growth generators. we help msps grow  
whether it's sales training marketing or  
business operations we've been super  
fortunate you guys have going to reach  
out like crazy and we truly truly  
appreciate that before I get into  
today's video I do have to mention one  
quick thing and that is come hang out  
with us in the Discord honestly it is  
one of the most active communities for  
msps as far as business owners go salese  
go and the MSP marketers that are out  
there if you want to join I will leave a  
link down below but it is simple to get  
in there growth-rates  
docomo to our website growth  
[generator.com](http://generator.com/) you'll actually see it  
it's under the resources you'll be a go  
down click Discord and you should jump  
right in there and hey maybe you want to  
stop by grab some of our free resources  
as well so let's talk about we want to  
position you as the expert that's  
ultimately the goal and I cannot if I  
had a dollar for every mssp cyber  
security company that was good at  
showing people they are the best I'd  
have not many dollars in all honesty  
most people suck it's okay that's what  
this video is for to get you over the  
suck so the first thing that we have to  
do is with an mssp and manage security  
service provider right or manage service  
security provider however you want to  
swap the s's out there is a lot that you  
that comes into play when you go about  
positioning your company and if you do  
it the wrong way you open yourself up to  
just lost opportunities and the big  
thing with this is building trust right  
selling it is very different but getting  
found online and positioning your  
business as the expert is wildly  
important because if they go to you and  
they don't see trust they don't see that  
you are the best out there but not only  
that they want you to take it one step  
further they want to know what your core  
values are you see cyber security unlike  
regular managed Services you have to  
focus a lot on building trust and making  
the people that see your material see  
your website and interact with you feel  
like you're a good person there's a lot  
of faith that goes into trust fun fact I  
was a fireman for 10 years I wear these  
shirts because it builds trust when I  
see people right in a weird way I mean I  
spent a lot of time doing it and and I'm  
about to do it again and I'm super  
excited volunteering to do something for  
my community it's a great way to build  
trust when it comes to those things but  
you have to build trust as a core value  
of your business and you got to really  
kind of button up and make sure you tie  
up the Loose Ends anything that could be  
bad right you want to have trust in your  
business and that is the most important  
thing throughout this video I'm going to  
give you a bunch of other super helpful  
hints that are going to be able to  
basically I don't want to say launch you  
but build up more and more of that trust  
going forward and have your perspective  
clients look at you and say hey this is  
somebody that I want to actually do  
business with and the most important  
thing throughout this is going to be  
having a fantastic client relationship  
that means going out and as you provide  
services you kind of have a little bit  
of an easy job now I'm not saying cyber  
security is Easy by any stretch of the  
imagination but what I am saying is for  
the most part as long as your clients  
are not getting hacked things aren't  
going Ary and you're they're seeing  
reports saying hey everything's safe  
they're going to be for the most part  
pretty happy this now gives you the  
opportunity to have a massive impact on  
that client relationship and get one of  
the most important things which is a  
case study or testimonial or if you want  
to combine those two for the Holy Grail  
of greatest marketing materials there  
are that is how you do it so we've  
talked about understanding the  
importance of trust the next is going to  
be building a strong brand identity  
because your brand is going to carry  
carry all the way through there's not  
going to be any there can't be any loose  
gaps throughout it and this is probably  
one of the times that I would say it's  
worth getting a copywriter involved or  
having somebody that's really good with  
communication and speaking and being  
able to convey the thoughts or the image  
of a brand is more important than most  
other areas you see as you go through  
this you want to make sure that your  
messaging is Crystal Clear what you're  
providing what you're doing how you're  
doing it why you're doing it and why  
people should trust you that is going to  
make for a massively more successful  
digital and personal preference you have  
to go through and learn to speak the  
language and talk the talk and walk the  
walk you have to almost wear it like a  
badge of honor it's really really  
important and that's what people want to  
see because what cyber security is we  
can't touch it for the most part it's  
not like video surveillance and access  
control where you can see cameras you're  
going to have a fob for a door for the  
most part your customers are just  
literally handing you money and they're  
going to get a piece of paper back  
saying that you're doing the best job  
possible of course it's going to say how  
many attacks were avoided or anything  
like that that you might run in your  
report but for the most part it's not  
like a regular manag service provider  
where they're going to pick up a phone  
and say hey this is broken can you come  
fix it in most cases you're making sure  
things don't happen you're being  
extremely proactive to make sure that  
phone never rings for an emergency that  
would be really really bad now I  
wouldn't normally do this but there is a  
fantastic book and I'm going to actually  
share my screen here because I think  
it's important just to look at at  
building the messaging and kind of build  
the brand in the right way and I'm going  
to just go over to Amazon really quick  
but it's called building a story brand  
uh and it's a really really good book as  
far as what you need to do for H like  
building that messaging behind it so I'm  
just sharing my screen here for those of  
you that are listening on the podcast  
MSP Heroes available on all platforms  
and this is a fantastic fantastic book  
when it comes to actually like getting  
your message clear because  
people are once again there's nothing  
tangible they're literally giving you  
money for a digital product and it's not  
even like a tool that they're going to  
use they have to expect that you're  
doing the right thing and building a  
story brand is fantastic I will leave  
that as the second link down below if  
you'd like to grab the book but it is  
really really good and you guys can see  
that I have a bunch of books uh books  
and supplements that I'm I'm always  
trying to biohack uh my way to make my  
brain as efficient as possible as well  
but in all honesty you got to to make  
sure that your brand your story is as  
good as possible that is going to help  
set you apart and not only you brand  
your story but once again wearing it  
like a badge of honor it's really really  
important it's also really important to  
hit that like button that subscribe  
button and that notification Bell so now  
let's talk about you we've now talked  
about building the brand we've talked  
about establishing trust getting a clear  
message right all super important things  
we we have to go through and now is the  
time to kind of flaunt a little bit  
right we have worked super hard in the  
industry and I say we because I am  
absolutely not somebody that has taken  
any of these tests but I know what's  
involved in them this is where we get to  
flaunt the certifications and awards it  
is wildly important whether it's sock 2  
it does not matter if you have gone  
through you should have a page on your  
website saying some of our  
accomplishments  
and yes it is kind of the time that you  
get to really shine but a nice wall of  
medallions the badges that they give you  
is important heck and if you have and  
this is probably one of the only other  
times I'll say it if you have the  
plaques that go up on the wall taking a  
picture in front of those plaques is not  
a bad idea at all it is going to only  
help your brand this is the only time I  
will say certifications are truly  
important for your industry indry people  
want to know that you didn't just go out  
and say I'm a cyber secur company now  
and I'm going to roll this out on a  
bunch of computers they want to know a  
lot more than that they want to see what  
you're doing and this in most cases is  
the time when customers will start doing  
a little bit of homework you have to  
make sure it's easy an easy way to do  
that is if they click the image it opens  
up the either award or it opens up the  
website that you got accredited from  
that is super super important I have a  
buddy of mine infos SEC Pat he does a  
really really good job at this and shout  
out to Pat he's an absolute rock star I  
love following him on social media but  
he does a fantastic job at talking about  
the certifications that he's gotten he  
does a fantastic job of walking people  
through and kind of telling people and  
maybe I could find it while I'm in the  
video but he he does a really good job  
at bringing people through all of this  
this process here and I'm going to share  
my screen here again Patrick Gorman  
absolute Rockstar runs a channel called  
infos SEC Pat but inside of here like  
he's always posting his cyber security  
achievements in there and it gives him  
granted he is a YouTuber so he's going  
to have a lot of content specifically in  
this area but it gives him a ton of  
credibility right he talks all about it  
a trainer Mentor all of that and if you  
go through a bunch of his posts he was  
just doing a bunch of super super cool  
stuff um in this area right bug the  
Bounty Hunter path hack the box right he  
has it right here Academy hack the bo uh  
hack the Box Award of the badge uh ready  
to hunt bugs like he is constantly  
putting this stuff out where he's he's  
he's walking the walk and talking the  
talk I'm super impressed and proud of  
the guy for doing what he does he lives  
and breathes info security which that's  
where he gets his name infos SEC Pat  
right so that is super important to have  
is the certifications and awards have  
them readily available it shouldn't be  
your whole personality but a page on  
your website and maybe some of the  
bigger players all the way in the footer  
of the website next is they want to know  
that the people that are running the  
company are important people and are the  
thought leaders of the industry now they  
don't have to be infos Pat where they  
are going out and creating a ton of  
content but they should have not just a  
name their title it should be about the  
person what they like what they don't  
like what positions them as a path to  
success that's really really important  
and as you begin to go and grow through  
this area once again building those case  
studies preferably with the leadership  
team involved in it it just continues to  
build that credibility all the way  
through the entire process now let's say  
you get a new client and you want to  
continue on that conversation here how  
do we actually do that you got to be  
transparent right things are going to  
happen they're bound to happen you as  
the expert should be providing content  
on a fairly regular basis if you don't  
like typing sorry but you should be able  
to at least produce a LinkedIn article a  
video a blog post on your website a  
podcast anything like that on a somewhat  
regular basis there's hacks going on all  
of the time but your potential customers  
and your existing customers are looking  
at you to be the point of hey this is  
the information this is what we've found  
this is why we do things the way we do  
things this is how we do how we make  
things redundant right this is part of  
our threat hunting whatever it is as far  
as you decide to go it's really  
important and as you go through that  
that begins to educate your clients and  
your future clients they want to see  
that you guys are the best out there  
just like this YouTube channel right I  
produce a ton of content you guys have  
tried TR in me you guys implement it and  
it works it's the exact same process you  
provide that content they see it that  
you're the one producing the content it  
might be in the news every once in a  
while hence crowd strike um but like hey  
it happens right but if it comes from  
you it makes it significantly better and  
you get to be proactive about this which  
builds a ton of trust for you and your  
business and as you go through this  
process I cannot stress it enough  
because they're not buying anything  
physical you're probably not even going  
to go on site for the most part and roll  
out the services you have to be  
aggressive with getting testimonials  
building case studies and being super  
proactive wherever you can by doing each  
one of those steps you are going to make  
life a million times easier for you but  
this is one of the few times I would say  
your branding your messaging your  
website really has to be as dialed in as  
possible because they're not going to  
know you unless you're making a ton of  
content on the internet but you want to  
give yourself every opportunity to  
succeed in the mssp space or the cyber  
security space they absolutely go hand  
in hand so I hope you guys found some  
value in this if you did hit that like
