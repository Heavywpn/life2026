SUMMARY:  
Former Pegasus spyware developer creates "unhackable" phone called Unplugged, addressing privacy concerns in modern smartphones.

IDEAS:  
• Unplugged phone was created as a response to government and big tech abuses  
• The phone operates independently of Google and Apple ecosystems  
• Unplugged's CTO is the original developer of Pegasus spyware  
• Pegasus was initially created for remote phone servicing, not surveillance  
• The company offers bounties for hacking their system at hacker conferences  
• Unplugged phone doesn't leak user data like mainstream smartphones  
• Average American child has 72 million data points collected by age 13  
• Mainstream phones perform large data dumps nightly, Unplugged doesn't  
• The phone allows use of familiar apps without compromising privacy  
• Unplugged aims to provide communication without sacrificing personal data

QUOTES:  
• "I said we got to have a our own phone independent of the Google and apple universe that they can't cancel"  
• "our CTO is actually the guy that developed Pegasus"  
• "he developed Pegasus as a way for a company as a for a phone company to do service"  
• "nobody's hacked it still got the Bitcoin and it's it's a lot more value now too"  
• "the average kid in America by the time they reach the age of 13 has had 72 million data points collected on them by big Tech"  
• "we did unplugged as a way for people to still communicate in the world but not be giving off all their Digital Data to Big Tech"

FACTS:  
• Apple plans to integrate ChatGPT into iPhones to analyze user data  
• Former Vice President Cheney's pacemaker was a security concern for the Secret Service  
• Smartphones typically have a 32-digit advertising ID for tracking  
• Local law enforcement agencies now have access to advanced surveillance technology  
• Smartphones often perform large data dumps between 2-3 AM  
• DHS agents can use ad ID data to determine which side of the bed a person sleeps on

REFERENCES:  
• Pegasus spyware  
• Unplugged phone  
• DARPA  
• Defcon hacker conference  
• Heritage Foundation  
• ChatGPT  
• Bitcoin

RECOMMENDATIONS:  
• Use an Unplugged phone for increased privacy and data security  
• Be aware of the extensive data collection performed by mainstream smartphones  
• Consider the implications of using Google and Apple ecosystems  
• Attend hacker conferences to stay informed about cybersecurity  
• Be cautious about the data collected through smartphone advertising IDs  
• Consider the privacy implications of smart medical devices  
• Understand that familiar apps may compromise privacy on mainstream phones  
• Be aware of nighttime data dumps from smartphones  
• Research the extent of data collection on children through technology  
• Consider the balance between convenience and privacy in technology use

Intro

**0:00**

I am curious who helped you who helped

**0:02**

you develop this are you are you me yeah

**0:06**

he developed Pegasus he developed

**0:08**

Pegasus he's an Israeli guy nobody's

**0:10**

acted still got the Bitcoin and it's

**0:12**

it's a lot more valuable now

**0:14**

too well that's good to

**0:18**

hear Apple just announced that in their

Jet GPT

**0:20**

next upgrade coming this fall that

**0:22**

they're going to actually put jet GPT on

**0:24**

every iPhone to collect and analyze all

**0:28**

the data of yours that's

**0:30**

through an iPhone if you're using it

**0:32**

it's it is

**0:34**

shocking uh what big Tech thinks they

**0:37**

can do to get away with and and look

**0:39**

some people are sheep and they want to

**0:42**

live like sheep and be treated like

**0:43**

sheep and I you know not everyone is a

**0:47**

sheep well you're so concerned about it

**0:51**

you co-founded unplugged

Unhackable Phone

**0:54**

yeah I having been um having having seen

**0:58**

the abuses of of law enforcement and a

**1:02**

politicized politicized government

**1:04**

organs and especially after the 2020

**1:07**

election um seeing them cancel certain

**1:10**

voices throwing people off of app stores

**1:13**

or whatever for being an election Den or

**1:16**

questioning covid or all this nonsense I

**1:21**

said we got to have a our own phone

**1:23**

independent of the Google and apple

**1:24**

universe that they can't cancel and

**1:27**

because we had a team together already

**1:29**

that that had done uh a lot of offense

**1:33**

and defensive cyber around phones

**1:35**

including building a completely separate

**1:37**

operating system for a secure phone and

**1:39**

even one that controls

**1:42**

pacemakers um we did it and uh yeah we

**1:45**

we we got unplugged to Market You'

**1:47**

talked about it with your customers

**1:48**

we're we hope you're using your

**1:51**

phone got it right here right on we got

**1:54**

the whole team these we set up the whole

**1:56**

uh massud interview in Vienna good with

**1:58**

these and gave massud one is if you

**2:01**

watched it you know but um I am curious

**2:05**

who helped you who helped you develop

**2:08**

this uh Tech Team in our CEO is um I

**2:14**

name Ryan Patterson and he is a

**2:16**

ex-marine DARPA guy um built a company

**2:19**

that does most of the uh Communications

**2:22**

into denied areas for the

**2:24**

USG um and uh the our CTO is actually

**2:28**

the guy that developed Pegasus

**2:31**

are you are you [ __ ] me yeah he

**2:33**

developed Pegasus he developed Pegasus

**2:35**

he's an Israeli guy but that scares the

**2:37**

[ __ ] out of me do you want to talk about

**2:39**

Pegasus but he developed Pegasus as a

Pegasus

**2:42**

way for a company as a for a phone

**2:43**

company to do service if you have a

**2:45**

problem with your phone they send you a

**2:48**

text you click on the text they can take

**2:50**

over your phone fix it remotely and then

**2:52**

leave when it be when when when the

**2:54**

company traded hands he left when it

**2:57**

became offensive he left and and he

**3:00**

built a it's called the intact phone

**3:01**

which is a highly secure government

**3:04**

phone and then he left and built the um

**3:08**

a phone that controls most of the

**3:09**

world's pacemakers so not not just

**3:11**

having to do with intelligence and

**3:13**

government related stuff but literally a

**3:15**

healthcare controlling a healthcare

**3:16**

device that goes in someone's body

**3:18**

because like when um when Cheney was

**3:21**

pres vice president the main Secret

**3:24**

Service concern then was someone hacking

**3:26**

his his pacemaker because you can't have

**3:28**

a hackable Pacer maker mhm

**3:31**

mhm so yes fair question from a you know

**3:37**

we we've done all the third party

**3:40**

penetration testing is there back doors

**3:41**

all the rest we put out huge bounties at

**3:44**

the uh Defcon hacker conference to say

**3:46**

this is our messenger this is our

**3:48**

operating system if you can hack it

**3:50**

there's Bitcoin wallets in these places

**3:53**

if you can hack it

**3:55**

great nobody's hacked it still got the

**3:58**

Bitcoin and it's it's a lot more value

**4:00**

now

**4:00**

too well that's good to hear what are

**4:03**

some of the I mean I know some of the

**4:05**

features and uh I just told you I spent

**4:08**

yesterday at the uh sheriff's department

**4:10**

and I some of the tech they have I was

**4:14**

it's been a minute since uh it's been

**4:17**

about 10 years since I've been with the

**4:18**

agency and the tech that the local

**4:21**

sheriff Spartan has now crushes what I

**4:24**

was involved in and what I had access to

**4:27**

right and uh so whether it's sting RAC

Features

**4:29**

the ad IDs all this stuff it's all based

**4:32**

on the exhaust given off by your Google

**4:35**

or Android type phone right with what

**4:38**

even the the the Heritage Foundation

**4:41**

running checks on the ad IDs that so

**4:45**

each each Google or Apple phone has a

**4:47**

like a 32 digigit advertising ID it's a

**4:51**

code you can some could call it the mark

**4:52**

of the beast that follows that device

**4:54**

around everywhere and that's how the

**4:58**

tech companies track where that device

**5:01**

goes to figure out proximity for

**5:03**

advertising sales and who you're

**5:05**

interacting with in your schedule the

**5:07**

average kid in America by the time they

**5:10**

reach the age of 13 has had 72 million

**5:13**

data points collected on them by big

**5:14**

Tech wow using that advertising ID

**5:18**

wow so again we did unplugged as a way

**5:21**

for people to still communicate in the

**5:24**

world but not be giving off all their

**5:27**

Digital Data to Big Tech to people that

**5:30**

really don't like them that

**5:33**

um yeah so you can use pretty much all

**5:37**

the same apps that you're used to but

**5:39**

they're not providing you the customized

**5:41**

experience because it's not leaking

**5:44**

sending all of your data out every night

**5:46**

we did a a side-by-side test between our

**5:49**

phone and Google and apples and uh the

**5:53**

Google and Apple phones seem to wake up

**5:54**

between 2 and 3: at night and they have

**5:57**

this huge like a 50 megabyte data dump

**6:00**

that is sent out from the phone every

**6:02**

night basically that that phone phoning

**6:05**

home sending off your preferences

**6:08**

everything you've done that day ours

**6:10**

doesn't

**6:12**

wow wow the uh in the in the book um the

**6:18**

means of control talks about a DH there

**6:21**

was a d DHS agent interviewed about

**6:25**

using some of this early adte stuff and

**6:28**

he demoed it and he tested it on

**6:31**

himself and sure enough from the ad ID

**6:34**

alone he could figure out which he could

**6:37**

confirm which side of the bed he was

**6:39**

sleeping on in his

**6:41**

house so again some people are fine

**6:44**

being sheep we are for the non

**6:48**

sheep I'm a non sheep but uh what are

**6:52**

some of the what are some of the other

**6:53**

features on the phone I know it has the

**6:55**

kill switch we have a we have a kill

Conclusion

**6:56**

switch which physically separates the

**6:58**

electronics from the battery because if

**7:00**

you if you try to shut off your existing

**7:02**

phone it doesn't actually shut off it uh

**7:05**

it's still listening it's still pinging

**7:06**

towers and still pinging Wi-Fi building

**7:08**

a digital breadcrumb Trail uh we have a

**7:11**

secure messenger with a dump feature

**7:13**

with uh if someone tries to take your

**7:16**

phone and force you to unlock it you can

**7:18**

unlock it with a called the clear pin

**7:19**

data code and it wipes it and it will

**7:21**

brick the phone so again it's the phone

**7:24**

is for free people that want to be

**7:26**

secure in their first and Fourth

**7:28**

Amendment rights

**7:30**

the right to free speech and your Fourth

**7:31**

Amendment right to be free of uh of

**7:34**

illegal searches because because what

**7:37**

what what this fisa expansion is is I

**7:40**

cannot imagine it stands up

**7:42**

constitutionally because it is so beyond

**7:45**

the pale of anything that's

**7:48**

legal put it this way the founding

**7:50**

fathers went to war over over taxes on

**7:54**

on land transfer stamps the Stamp Act

**8:00**

where basically with that with that fisa

**8:02**

expansion that even some Republicans

**8:04**

voted

**8:06**

for terrible terrible ter it literally

**8:09**

allows government into every aspect of

**8:11**

your Digital Life with no warrant and

**8:13**

with no probable cause just because they

**8:16**

don't like Shawn Ryan I know they don't

**8:18**

like me but um join the club do you

**8:21**

think that do you think you guys will

**8:22**

develop some type of a computer as well

**8:25**

yeah we've talked about a tablet and

**8:26**

then a um um a top as well no matter

**8:30**

where you're watching Shan Ryan Show
