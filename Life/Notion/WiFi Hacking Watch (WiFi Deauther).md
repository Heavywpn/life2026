Transcipt: ChaptersTranscriptThe WIFI hacking watch // Quick demo0:00I've purchased a new watch but this isn't like  other watches this is a Wi-Fi detho watch allows  0:06me to attack Wi-Fi networks as always with these  kinds of devices only attack networks that you  0:11have permission to attack or that you own in this  example I've got a phone and a laptop connected to  0:17a Wi-Fi network I can access the internet on this  phone I'll also start a continuous ping on this  0:23laptop and hopefully you can see that this laptop  is able to Ping google.com but what happens when  0:30I start the deor tack so I'll press Start packets  are now being sent into the network de oring  0:36clients and what you should see is the laptop can  no longer ping google.com I have deor this laptop  0:45from the Wi-Fi network on the phone try and go  to YouTube It's failing because the device has  0:52been kicked off the Wi-Fi network if I go and  look at my Wi-Fi settings and try and connect  0:57to my Wi-Fi network it says connection pH try  and do that again connection failed devices are  1:03no longer able to access the internet because  deor packets are being sent from the watch to  1:10the Wi-Fi access point this little access point  right over here kicking clients off the network  1:15okay I'll stop the deor attack and what you  should notice hopefully is that pings start  1:20succeeding on the laptop and there you go and if  I connect back to the Wi-Fi network I'm able to  1:25do that I'm connected now and I should be able  to go to youtube.com which I can under ssids you  1:34can specify the clone of access points so you  can see I'm cloning a whole bunch here or you  1:39could go with a random mode to create a bunch  of random access points so I'll go back back  1:44again deny access beacons and start and what  I'll do here is look at the different Wi-Fi  1:51networks and you can see a bunch of fake Wi-Fi  networks exist you could use Rick Roll Nam share2:02one caveat with this watch is it only supports  2.4 GHz and not 5 GHz but it's a fantastic little  2:07device for testing and demonstration purposes now  this is called the Wi-Fi Commander not a Wi-Fi de  WIFI Commander features and unboxing2:13arthor even though it supports de oror tax and  other types of attacks this is very similar once  2:18again to this watch that I've demonstrated and  that's very similar to the Wi-Fi nugget as well  2:24as the meltronics de author now we're told that  it's got a 1.5 in OLED display it's got a digital  2:30Crown control now this was made in England  which is interesting not that much stuff is  2:34made in England these days it's a trademark of  code junkies once again I purchased this they  2:40are not sponsoring this video they don't know  that I'm even making this video that's enough  2:44talking let's unbox this not great packaging if  you like very basic so I got this from Amazon so  2:50what we get is the watch and a cable that's it so  that's the unboxing experience nothing fancy but  2:57it definitely looks more like a watch than this  does it's got a rub a strap here the strap isn't  3:02as nice I mean that doesn't look like a watch  this does so what's interesting is this didn't  3:06come with any instructions no instructions at  all but again that looks much more like a watch  3:11than what this thing does but the proof of the  pudding is can it actually do what they say it  3:16can now there are some issues with this device I  found that the battery doesn't last that long I  3:20probably need to charge it for longer before I  continue with the demonstrations also the one  3:24that I got the charger is covered here so the  only way to charge this is to pop it up out of  3:29the watch and I saw on Amazon the reviews are  quite bad because people have found that it's  3:33broken when they've popped it out or popped it  back in but that hasn't been my experience so  3:38what you got to do is you got to use a micro USB  cable one is supplied with the watch and now it  3:43works as you can see it's powered up properly now  so you could just use it like this but obviously  3:48it makes more sense to use this as a watch but  you could just hold it like this in your palm  3:53of your hand as an example the power of the Sun  in the palm of my hand an attack Networks in the  3:59same way I mean that's a very small device that  could be hidden in your hand this is basically a  4:04better version of the previous watch that I've  demonstrated lot lot smaller looks more like  4:09a watch than this thing does remember the caveat  with this is it only supports 2.4 GHz that is made  4:14clear on the box only 2.4 GHz is supported okay  once you turn the watch on we can see that this  WIFI Commander demo // Scanning access points and Deauthing4:20is authorized by space Hardware by code junkies  when it boots up you're probably going to want  4:25to scan for Wi-Fi networks and you can scan for  either access points or stations themselves I'm  4:30going to scan for both now I have found that this  doesn't always work the display shows that there  4:35are zero access points even though it's actually  picking up access points as you can see here it's  4:40picked up one station but again that information  is incorrect and I've found that it freezes here  4:45so I'm going to Simply press the button again I'm  going to go back and then I'm going to select an  4:50access point so select and then access points I'm  going to select the access point that we're going  4:55to attack which is the TP Link 2.4 GHz that's  this little TP Link link right over here again  5:01only ever attack networks that you own or have  permission to attack so I'm going to select that  5:07and I'm going to go back and back again and now  we can deny access so select that option and let's  5:13say as an example specify deor and then start de  oring and what you'll notice over here is pings  5:19are now timing out so this device can no longer  access the internet so on the phone I'll press go  5:27notice no internet is available so we have success  sucessfully deauth to the network you can see that  5:32we're sending packets but if I stop that we should  see is on the Windows computer PS should start  5:38working again which they do so deor attac has now  been stopped so it's as simple as that once again  5:44to launch a deor attac using this watch really  cool that it's so much smaller than the previous  5:49generations that I've demonstrated just looks like  a standard sports watch as an example now another  Sending Beacons5:53option here is to send beacons I'll select beacons  and then I'll scroll down and start the attack so  6:02beacons are being sent out into the network now  now this can be used to fake the real Network or  6:07just Spam the air with a bunch of fake networks  so as an example if I go to Wi-Fi and look at the  6:13Wi-Fi networks notice I'm suddenly seeing a whole  bunch of TPL link networks many of them these are  6:21all fake networks so I'll stop that attack  and go back the reason I was able to do that  6:27is under ssids you you can specify the clone of  access points so you can see I'm cloning a whole  6:33bunch here or you could go with a random mode to  create a bunch of random access points so I'll go  6:39back back again deny access beacons and start and  what I'll do here is look at the different Wi-Fi  6:47networks and you can see a bunch of fake Wi-Fi  networks exist you could use Rick Roll name share  6:57but as you can see a whole bunch of random ssids  are now being broadcast by the watch now various  Packet monitor7:05other options are also supported so I can go back  and then I could do a packet monitor as an example  7:13and monitor packets in the network so I can see  what's going on now one of the options with the  WIFI Commander remote connection and control7:18watch is you can actually connect to it remotely  so I'm going to select the Ping SSID we told that  7:25this is an open network I'm okay with that so  I'm going to connect to to the open network  7:31called Pang so I'm now connected to that Network  and in my browser so I'm going to browse to 1921  7:3616841 and as you can see a web page is opened we  told that this project is a proof of concept for  7:42testing and educational purposes only the watch  uses an esp8266 so we warned that the esp8266 chip  7:50and the SDK are not built for real world purposes  they only Built for testing and education purposes  7:57and bugs can occur and we told the only use this  against our own networks and devices which I'm  8:02doing so you can get more information on GitHub  once again space hun or space chicken if you use  8:09the English translation has more information on  his website and I said I've read the notice and  8:15what I'll do here is Click reload and that shows  me the various Wi-Fi networks so I can see the  8:22encryption used I can see the MAC address I  can see the power whole bunch of information  8:29about Wi-Fi networks I can also see client  devices so if I go to ssids I could clone  8:36an SSID or add one and I could enable  random mode so at the moment clicking  8:41reload a bunch of them are random so a whole  bunch of random ssids I'll remove those and  8:47click reload now again you could add your own  ssids here and um do a Rick Roll SSID as an8:53example so under deny we could start a deauth  attack we could start a beacon attack we could  9:02start probing they also give us a nice  explanation of what each does so Beacon  9:06packets are used to advertise access points  deal I've demonstrated where we knock clients  9:11off a network and probes are sent by client  devices to ask if a known network is nearby  9:16you can use this attack to confuse Wi-Fi trackers  by asking for networks that you specified in the  9:22SSID list I could go to settings and reboot the  device as an example or reset it now I've put  Spacehuhntech GitHub, Amazon and product page9:29links below to space Hun's GitHub page where you  can get a lot of information about the ESP 82660  9:35author that he created fantastic project he gives  you information about how it works I've also put  9:40a link to Amazon where I bought this can see the  ratings here are terrible but there is an overview  9:46of the device on Amazon and you can have a look  at their website to get more information again I  9:51think it's a great little tools for demonstration  purposes it only supports 2.4 GHz however doesn't  9:57always work with modern access points even  when they use 2.4 GHz so if you want to stop  How to prevent WIFI pranks10:02kids using devices like this from pranking you or  destroying your Wi-Fi network or you want to stop  10:08hackers that have more powerful devices that  can do something similar use wp3 with a strong  10:14password not just numbers but mixed characters  uppercase lowercase special characters etc make  10:20the password long use WPA version 3 use 5 GHz  use 6 GHz hope you enjoyed this video if you  Conclusion10:27did please consider liking it please consider  subscribing to my YouTube channel and clicking  10:31on the Bell to get notifications I'm David  Bombal and I want to wish you all the very bestEnglish
