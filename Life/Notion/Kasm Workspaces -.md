(Docker Containers STREAMING Kali Linux to your browser)# https://www.youtube.com/watch/U7e-mcJdZok00:00:00.030 What I'm about to show you is theultimate hacking workspace. No joke.00:00:03.910 This technology is nuts. Andhonestly, I use this thing every day.00:00:08.200 Change the game for me,completely like check this out.00:00:10.520 I may be researching hacking stuff, andthere's some sketchy links out there.00:00:13.080 But with one click,00:00:18.750 just like that, a new browseropen, but it's isolated, secure.00:00:22.390 Heck it's not even on my http://machine.is/ it a bad link? I don't care.00:00:25.890 Not my machine or maybe I want a fresh,00:00:27.550 clean and sense of call Lennoxfor some quick hacking or testing.00:00:30.340 Boom right here in my browser seconds.And when I'm done, boom, blow it up.00:00:34.350 Like it never existed.00:00:35.330 Or maybe a spin up two and have 'em attackeach other Cali and Navy U boom too.00:00:39.210 And no, this doesn't involve some heavyvirtual machines or WSL two it's Docker00:00:43.540 containers streaming to yourbrowser. What, in the best part,00:00:47.480 I'm gonna show you how to setthis up in about five minutes.00:00:50.120 Me and Cameron are hi. That's mybrother. It could be in the cloud.00:00:52.700 It could be in your house. And myfavorite part, it's completely free.00:00:55.900 Thanks to our sponsor. Chasm http://workspaces.so/ get you coffee ready or tea.00:00:59.900 If you're a loser, shut up. Let's do this.00:01:04.110 So end up talking.00:01:05.050 Let's talk about what you needto actually get this thing going.00:01:07.110 The list is not long. That's the goodnews. Cameron tell 'em what we need. Oh,00:01:12.130 I was not ready for this.  nowall you pretty much need is a server,00:01:15.650 which might sound scary, but it'sjust a small server. That's it?00:01:18.170 Cameron tell 'em what we need. Go ahead.00:01:24.560 I know you're staring at me. So hereare the minimum survey requirements.00:01:27.330 We're gonna be two VCPS, four gigsof Ram and 50 gigabytes of storage,00:01:32.700 SSD preferred. And this applies to cloudor OnPrem, which could be your house.00:01:36.540 But we're gonna show you both. Thanks,Cameron.  got my chair. See how,00:01:40.640 what Cameron set. That's prettymuch it. Well, one more thing.00:01:43.330 You gotta have coffee, everything init requires coffee or tea. Shut up.00:01:46.870 Never Chuck duck coffee.Now I know you're ready.00:01:48.790 I know you're itching to get starteddoing this, but first, before we do that,00:01:51.910 I wanna talk about the magic behindhow this actually works. Now,00:01:54.710 if you don't care about that,go ahead and skip forward.00:01:56.230 I got time stamps below,but chasm is so cool. I, I,00:02:00.230 I think I just wanna tellyou about it. Actually.00:02:01.590 I don't wanna tell you about it. Cameron'sgonna tell you about how chasm works,00:02:04.800 how the magic of Docker containerstreaming to your browser00:02:09.630 works. I said works a lot.Anyways. Cameron saved me.00:02:13.380  here's how chasm works. Soyou install chasm on your server. Now,00:02:16.340 if you wanna open up a secure web browser,00:02:17.760 or even an instance of call Linux chasmwill automatically open this up in a00:02:21.260 Docker container and streamit to your browser. He works.00:02:23.700 Isn't that cool camerabe more excited anyways.00:02:27.070 And it does this using chasmsproprietary software called chasm B,00:02:30.900 which is it's it's open http://source.it/'s open source. There we go.00:02:36.010  oh yeah. One thing.Camera move. Gimme your pen.00:02:38.850 So these Docker containersare just regular containers.00:02:41.440 They're actually on Docker hub andyou can just pull them from there.00:02:44.920 You can go look at 'em and you can evencreate your own custom Docker images,00:02:48.560 container things.Anyways, here you go. Oh,00:02:50.880 also also think about the start camera.One way is you can put it in the cloud.00:02:53.320 We're gonna show you how to do that.This is my cloud. Shut up camera.00:02:55.900 And whenever you're surfing the internetor doing some hacking stuff in Cali,00:02:59.540 um, you're using theclouds IP address. So,00:03:02.760 whereas normally you'd be going directlyto your ISP using your home internet IP00:03:06.840 address using chasm. You'rekind of hiding yourself a bit,00:03:10.250 especially from your ISP, keepingyourself a bit anonymous and you,00:03:13.540 you could be anywhere you could be atStarbucks drinking, coffee or tea .00:03:17.820 So,00:03:18.040 because you're chasm server is installedon your business network or your home00:03:21.510 network, you have access to everythingthat is on your network. Like,00:03:24.910 think about that cameranot being excited enough.00:03:26.530 You have access to your Sonology insideyour home network or all that stuff.00:03:29.430 Like just all your stuff, your,00:03:30.790 all your other home lab stuff remotelythrough dock container streaming,00:03:34.070 just magic, magic, magic. Butthat's the basic of how chasm works.00:03:37.170 But now you wanna set it up, but I'llhave Chuck walk you through that. Yeah,00:03:41.020 yeah. Hear you tea drinking. Wooy allright.  nothing wrong with tea,00:03:45.400 but you know, coffee's better. Okay.00:03:47.300 Now time to actually installchasm on our server, uh,00:03:50.260 like Cameron was talking about, he justtook freaking forever to explain it.00:03:53.120 I'm just kidding. He did a greatjob. Let us know how he did guys.00:03:55.400 If you wanna see more of Cameron, ifyou don't, we're gonna show him anyway.00:03:58.400 Now we mentioned that we can installall this pretty much anywhere,00:04:01.030 but the two I'm gonna show youis the cloud. And then, uh,00:04:03.950 OnPrim AKA your houseor your business. Now,00:04:06.490 thankfully the differencebetween the two is not a lot.00:04:08.810 It's pretty much the same, but let'sfocus on the cloud first. Now, you know,00:04:11.490 my favorite cloud provider,00:04:12.430 my favorite thing to do and use is Linodemainly because if you've never used00:04:16.610 'em before you get a hundred dollarsfree credit right now to sign up.00:04:19.510 So you much get to try this out for http://free.so/ just shut up and do it link below.00:04:24.060 So with your Len node account setup,00:04:25.570 we'll first go to create at the topleft and, uh, well create, click on it,00:04:30.060 create a Len node from here.00:04:31.600 We're just gonna do our best to meetthe minimum requirements. First,00:04:34.060 the images we're gonna rock UbuntuUbuntu 20 0 4. Don't use 21.00:04:39.560  yeah, he's right. I tried 21did not work 20 0 4 El least. That's at,00:04:43.470 at the time of this recording,I'm losing my mind anyways,00:04:45.790 too much coffee already.00:04:46.470 How you doing T boy we'll then selectour regions somewhere close to you.00:04:49.150 And then for the plan, this is wherethe minimum requirements come in. Um,00:04:51.830 dedicated. I don't need that. Idon't have that kind of money.00:04:53.890 I'm doing shared CPU. And the minimumrequirement will be this guy right here.00:04:57.120 Leino for gigabits orbites. Sorry, not bits.00:04:59.630 Four gigs of delicious Ram over arehere. And then two virtual CPUs.00:05:03.080 And we got plenty of hard repspace. Cause the minimum is 50 gigs.00:05:05.840 So this satisfies ourminimum requirements.00:05:08.010 Then I'll label it my chasm password.00:05:12.120 And that's pretty much it I'llclick on create Lin node. No, yeah,00:05:14.940 20 bucks a month.00:05:15.760 That's not the $5 a month we'renormally doing with these projects.00:05:18.360 That's because chasm is extra cooland require some extra, extra stuff.00:05:22.470 Now also keep in mind, I'm showingyou Le node. You can do this in AWS,00:05:25.890 digital ocean,00:05:26.610 pretty much any cloud provider thatcan produce virtual machines for you,00:05:29.490 which is all of http://them.it/'ll work now for on-prem.00:05:32.320 This will vary based onwhat you're using for me.00:05:34.450 I got prox Mo and all I'll do is createa VM. Make sure I'm doing UBO 2 20 0 4.00:05:38.170 Make sure my hard driveis at least 50 gigs.00:05:39.690 I go and throw like maybe75 at it for no reason,00:05:42.780 two virtual CPUs and four gigsRam. Again, this may vary for you,00:05:46.700 but that's pretty much the gist. Okay.Back to the node. Once yours is running,00:05:49.830 it's done provisioning.00:05:50.770 Let's go ahead and grab thisIP address and get logged in.00:05:53.080 Or you can copy the one over here.00:05:54.230 Copy launch your favorite terminalprogram on the windows. So I've got CMD,00:05:58.210 it'll be terminal on Mac and http://lennox.it/'ll be SSH route at your IP address,00:06:01.900 hit enter fingerprints. Yep. And thenenter your password that you set earlier.00:06:05.370 We're in now the installation of chasmis actually the easiest part of this00:06:08.320 entire tutorial. So easy that I feelcomfortable letting Cameron do it. So, uh,00:06:12.020 go ahead, cam. All right.00:06:12.840 So the first thing we're gonna do hereis actually for stability and we're going00:06:16.100 to get a swap partition.00:06:17.590 We're gonna put in this first commandto actually create the swap partition.00:06:20.960 We're gonna upgrade the permissions,actually make it into swap.00:06:24.370 And then we're gonna turnon the swap partition.00:06:26.360 These four commands are gonnabe below in the description.00:06:28.810 You could actually just copy and pastethese in and make the swap partition.00:06:31.410 And just to make sure that wemade our swap successfully,00:06:34.130 we can use the cat command to look insideof the swap file. And I can see here,00:06:38.520 we have our swap partition now to makesure that our swap will come back.00:06:42.460 Whenever there is a reboot, let'sgo ahead and just run this command.00:06:44.800 And this will add this to the Fs tab file.00:06:47.160 Now that we have theswap partition set up,00:06:49.400 we can now download the installationfile using the w get command.00:06:53.680 And you can see we're actually gettingthis from S3, go ahead and enter and,00:06:57.550 and let's get that downloaded.00:06:58.950 And now let's just run an LS realquick just to make sure that the file00:07:01.930 downloaded correctly. So thisfile is in the dot GZ format.00:07:05.590 So we will need to unzip this inorder to get the installation file.00:07:08.950 So let's paste that command in thereand that will extract it to our current00:07:12.210 directory. And we can now see thechasm release folders right there.00:07:16.480 Then we will do pseudo bash and thatwill just run this installation script.00:07:20.510 Then they'll want us to accept the enduser license agreement, just hit yes.00:07:24.140 And enter. And this installation'sgonna take a little bit,00:07:26.500 so go take a coffee break. We'llget back to it in a second, man.00:07:29.640 Those are pretty fast install.Wasn't it? Yeah, I'm kidding.00:07:32.340 Now on our screen here, uh, theygive us some credentials. Uh,00:07:35.640 the only really important ones herefor us are gonna be the admin one.00:07:38.560 Let's go ahead and grab 'em all just incase and just paste these into a note.00:07:41.770 And once you have that past it away,00:07:42.840 let's get back to Le node andlet's copy our IP address,00:07:46.220 open up a new tab and let'sdo HTT PS call slash slash and00:07:50.990 let's paste in the IP address ofour ode hit advanced and proceed.00:07:55.010 And now let's paste in this credentialsthat we saved a second ago, right?00:07:57.790 When you log in, you'll be presentedwith the chasm console. Uh,00:08:00.700 the first place they log youinto here is the admin portion.00:08:03.920 So you'll notice a lot ofsettings and stuff here.00:08:06.270 We're not gonna get to that right now.We'll go into that later in the video,00:08:08.970 what we're mainly focused on here,00:08:10.410 it's just the workspaces portion andthat's where all the fun stuff is.00:08:13.280 Now we can move over to workspaces andwe're just gonna pick Chrome for this,00:08:16.290 that launch session andboom, just like that.00:08:19.570 We have a containerized browser streamingto our computer. All right, Cameron,00:08:23.110 get on my seat. Yep. That's thebig stuff. That's the basic stuff.00:08:27.010  and at this pointyou're pretty much done.00:08:29.130 Like you've got your chasm insulationgoing. You can access your stuff.00:08:32.330 And if you go back to the actually toget back to let me show you how to do00:08:34.770 that. When you're sitting herechilling in your instance, here,00:08:37.419 there are little dots on the left. Look,those dots, you can do a few things.00:08:40.940 One of the main things we care aboutright now is getting it back to our00:08:43.000 workspace. Click those four littledots, more, a lot of dots here,00:08:46.520 and you can launch other stuff.00:08:47.580 So they've got dedicated apps that againwill just launch a Docker container.00:08:51.080 But these are apps you can launchright now from G, which is, uh,00:08:54.760 like drawing stuff like Photoshopoffice, just a terminal.00:08:57.580 If you want a terminal Ubuntuand even visual studio code,00:09:00.320 which I'll just launch that realquick is pretty cool. And bam,00:09:02.400 just like that visual studio codestreaming to me from a Docker container,00:09:05.720 which still is just, isn't that crazy.00:09:08.040  a Docker container streamingand shoot even a to browsers,00:09:11.160 browsing in a browser on a virtualmachine, in the cloud using tour.00:09:16.370 And it's inside a Docker container.00:09:17.630 There's so many things happeningwith tech-wise. It's like,00:09:20.130 it hurts your brain to thinkabout it, how you're doing this.00:09:22.520 Can't get more secure thanthis or anonymous. Now, again,00:09:25.750 you're pretty much done. Like you couldleave the video and be happy about this,00:09:28.810 but you know, we can't end there.There's some more cool things you can do.00:09:31.310 Like, I don't know if you notice, butwhen we are back in our portal here,00:09:35.020 click over back on admin dude.00:09:37.260  this is more than just like atoy we can play with. This is a full,00:09:41.030 crazy enterprise system tool, which again,00:09:44.180 it takes 10 years to tell you all thethings it can do and walk through that.00:09:47.560 But I will show you just a few things.00:09:49.140 I think you'll love and you'll wannado right now. Camera say right now,00:09:52.590 right now, now the firstthing you may want.00:09:54.460 And it's the first thing I wantwas the ability to take like,00:09:57.010 like remember the intro we had likemaybe nefarious links like this one,00:10:00.830 you may not wanna open that inyour browser, on your main desktop.00:10:03.300 There could be all kinds of crazystuff that affect your computer.00:10:06.430 So we want to be able to right,click that and say open and chasm,00:10:09.770 open a Docker container. That's safe,secure, and isolated. That won't hurt me.00:10:13.110 How do we do that? Now? Thisis simply a Chrome extension.00:10:15.650 And if you name brave or Firefox,I believe they have Firefox.00:10:18.790 I'll check on brave, but I'msure they have all of it.00:10:20.560 We're simply gonna add an extension orinstalling extension on our browser.00:10:23.540 So I'm just gonna look forChrome extension store.00:10:27.160 I think that's what it's called.Yeah. Just Google that jump in there.00:10:29.540 And we'll search for chasm at the topleft. There we go. I love the tagline.00:10:33.160 Open an isolation. In fact, Camerontold me about that. It's pretty cool.00:10:35.670 Anyways, we're gonnaclick on, add to Chrome,00:10:37.520 click on ad extension and it'sadded, but not quite done yet.00:10:41.430 We have a few more thingswe have to configure here.00:10:43.070 We're gonna go up toour puzzle piece here,00:10:44.190 which stands for extensions in Chrome.00:10:45.640 We're gonna scroll down until we seechasm, which is weirdly great out.00:10:48.550 It makes me feel weird, but it's fine.00:10:49.750 We're gonna click on the threedots and click on options.00:10:54.080 We're gonna change just really onething here. We're gonna add the URL for,00:10:57.080 for our chasm server that we just setup or the one that you just set up.00:11:00.400 So a past mine in here just likethat. And you can even choose, like,00:11:03.820 if you wanted to open a new windowor a new tab, I like new tab.00:11:06.300 It feels more like it'spart of my browser.00:11:07.530 Like I'm not doing anything outsidemy system, even though I totally am.00:11:10.260 So anyways, enough of that clickon save and that part's done.00:11:12.540 Just one more thing we have to do.00:11:13.870 We're gonna get back to our chasmworkspace here, our chasm dashboard.00:11:16.880 And from here, we're gonnago to the top, right?00:11:18.700 Click a little icon thereand then click on profile.00:11:21.070 Cuz this will be a settingthat is set per user. And yeah,00:11:23.910 you probably guess you canhave multiple users with this.00:11:26.270 You can have your friends, yourfamily, your kids use this,00:11:28.850 have different profiles. We'lltalk about that. Anyways.00:11:31.790 One thing we're gonna change right here.We have the default workspace image.00:11:34.920 This is what we'll launch. Wheneveryou do that, right. Click thing.00:11:37.290 We showed you earlier, clickon the dropdown and then choose your image.00:11:40.980 I'm gonna choose. Let's do brave. I likebrave. That's it. It's already saved.00:11:44.680 I don't have to do anythingelse. And now we can test it.00:11:46.480 It's gonna go back to that Redditpage and I'll pick a random link here.00:11:49.160 This guy right here, right click.And here we are open link and chasm.00:11:53.160 And just like that,00:11:54.080 a Docker container is being spun upbehind the scenes and it's streaming to my00:11:58.400 browser. I'm not opening this URL onmy computer. It's not tracking me.00:12:01.760 It doesn't know my IP http://address.it/'s not looking at my cookies,00:12:04.080 looking at my history. I'm completelyanonymous. As far as tracking me goes.00:12:08.780 And the cool thing is whatever I dohere in this browser, it doesn't matter.00:12:11.880 I can do whatever I stinking. What?Because guess what? I can just delete it.00:12:15.030 Like watch this click on theselittle dots here, delete session.00:12:18.310 I can trash the sucker, bad website,malware, whatever don't care. I'm secure.00:12:23.270 So I deleted it. It's gone. I was neverthere. I never accessed that website.00:12:26.810 No proof. And I think, youknow, think about that.00:12:28.550 That's probably the future of howwe deal with weird stuff like this,00:12:31.730 how we browse the internetright now, your computer,00:12:34.160 it designed to track a lotof what you do, cookies, um,00:12:37.450 your IP address your history. Andif your computer could track it,00:12:39.980 that means all these other websites,your accessing can track it as well.00:12:42.440 Not to mention these scare ofviruses in malware, which yeah,00:12:45.300 and we've got tools that can prevent that.00:12:46.460 We got tools that canscan what we download, uh,00:12:48.980 prevent what we access on the internet.But you know what? They're not perfect.00:12:51.960 The ideal use cases that we open upeverything in an isolated sandbox.00:12:55.350 And if we do do something bad, it doesn'tmatter. That instance, that browser,00:12:59.280 that VM is transient. Ephemeralbig words. It just disappears.00:13:03.590 Cuz it doesn't matter. Now secondtweak. I wanna show you real quick.00:13:05.850 Check this out. It's actuallykind of two tweaks in one first.00:13:08.390 If you scroll through your appshere in your, your workspaces,00:13:10.650 you'll notice that you don'tsee Cali Linux, which we,00:13:13.070 we talked about that a lot, but it'snot here. Did we lie to you? No, no.00:13:16.380 You can add more images and someare already default installed.00:13:19.340 So if I go back to admin, my adminportal over here on the left,00:13:22.520 I can click on images where I can managethe Docker images or containers that I00:13:26.600 can launch. Go and click on that.00:13:27.940 And here we already have 26 imagesready to go, but not all are enabled.00:13:31.960 So I'll start clicking onthe arrows down here. Here.00:13:33.880 We have doom for some reason.00:13:34.890 So if you wanna play doom in yourbrowser from a Docker container street,00:13:37.510 actually that sounds prettycool. Anyways, let's continue.00:13:40.270 I wanna go find call there. Itis call Lennox to enable this.00:13:43.830 I wanna click that box for the can.00:13:45.080 We're gonna click on the little dotshere on the right click on edit.00:13:48.490 And then right here towards themiddle, we have the enabled check box.00:13:51.440 Check that now while we'rehere at the same time,00:13:53.450 I'm gonna go ahead anddo the second tweak.00:13:55.560 Now when we launch Kelly Linuxwithout changing this second thing,00:13:59.290 it's gonna log us in as aregular user without root access.00:14:03.360 But of course we want root access. Wewant ultimate godlike control, right?00:14:06.440 One thing we have to changehere to make that happen.00:14:08.680 If you scroll down just a little bithere, we have the Docker run config,00:14:12.310 which by the way, you cando a ton of stuff with like,00:14:14.580 this is like a regular container.And if you know Docker containers,00:14:17.590 you can do everything here prettymuch. But one thing we care about,00:14:20.530 we're gonna do some JSON real quick.Don't worry. It's not scary. Uh,00:14:23.450 just follow along with me first. We'regonna type in user between double quotes.00:14:26.610 I'll do double quotethe user double quote,00:14:29.480 then I'll do a colon and then I'll doanother double quote and say root and then00:14:34.050 double quote. So just like this, thatis be beautiful. JSON right there.00:14:37.220 That's all we need. Just go down tothe bottom. Click on, submit done.00:14:40.940 Now it's not quite readyyet. If we go to our, uh,00:14:43.760 workspaces here at the top left,you'll see it here. Where to go.00:14:46.940 Oh right there. But it's got like alittle warning message right now. Your uh,00:14:51.210 chasm server is downloading the Dockercontainer for Cali getting all that00:14:54.680 stuff. Ready? No give, give ita minute. Just coffee break.00:14:57.820 You tip my coffee http://again.so/ now Cali is ready.00:14:59.820 I'm gonna go and launch the sucker realquick launch, which this is so cool.00:15:03.040 Right? And now that we have root enabled,all we have to do is when it launches,00:15:06.240 when we're in our terminal, like weshould be like you are right now.00:15:08.800 We'll do SU or switch userspit to become root. Okay.00:15:12.590 Now for the third tweak and it's thelast one I'm gonna show you cuz we don't00:15:15.030 have enough time andthis one's pretty cool.00:15:16.510 It involves users and web filtering sofar we've been using the admin profile,00:15:20.510 but of course you can add other users.00:15:22.210 So what I'm gonna do is add my daughtersas users, my two oldest anyway,00:15:25.470 Chloe and Addie.00:15:26.150 And what I'll demonstrate is how I canmake sure that they're gonna be browsing00:15:28.730 safely and securely and then law.They can access with web filtering,00:15:32.990 which is just built in,00:15:34.180 I can whitelist and blacklist withwhat I want them to access. So anyways,00:15:37.220 let's check it out real quick,super easy. So just like before,00:15:39.500 I'll go to my admin portalhere and over here on the left,00:15:41.940 I'll click on users right now.I've got the default users.00:15:44.140 I'll go ahead and click on adduser to add a new one, Chloe,00:15:47.560 and then I'll set a password forher. And now just keep in mind.00:15:49.880 I'm manually setting apassword for or Chloe,00:15:51.950 but you can integrate this with an L Dand SAML or single signon situation at00:15:55.930 your business. If you have one or ifyou have a home lab with that stuff,00:15:59.070 you can do it too, cuz I totallydo. And I will end up doing that.00:16:01.510 But username and password is pretty muchall we need for now. I'll click OnIt.00:16:05.080 I'll add my second user for add submit.00:16:07.710 So now all I have to do is give themmy IP address or the URL of my chasm00:16:10.970 instance and they can get accessto this with our credentials. Now,00:16:13.440 moving beyond that, Ican assign web filtering,00:16:15.550 very simple to set this up almoststupid, easy, uh, over here on the left,00:16:19.170 we'll see an option four webfilter. Go ahead and select that.00:16:22.340 And here we got nothing.Let's create something.00:16:24.300 Go ahead and click on ad policy. Nowwe don't have a ton of options here.00:16:27.920 I name this test, but some cool things,00:16:29.560 especially for kids or peoplethat you want to restrict too.00:16:32.890 We can say deny by default. So likewhatever website it is, don't go to it.00:16:36.270 Unless I explicitly say they're allowedto go to, which is perfect for my kids.00:16:39.310 They're curious.00:16:40.090 So I can say deny by default and theonly site that can access is network00:16:43.800 http://chuck.com/ also network chuck.coffee.You just put that all on the black list.00:16:48.510 Thanks Cameron. He justsays on the black list,00:16:50.200 we're gonna put that in the whitelist.  and just scroll down.00:16:53.340 We got a few more options or reallyjust one more enable safe search,00:16:56.300 which is a Google option to makesure they don't search for bad stuff.00:16:59.520 And then we could enable categorization.00:17:01.200 But that is a featurethat must be licensed,00:17:03.300 which you're probably thinkingChuck, you said it was free. It is,00:17:06.319 but not everything's free.This is a community edition,00:17:08.260 which is more than enough. Likeyou're gonna have a hard time,00:17:10.859 like not finding all the features youwant. We get a snapshot, the differences.00:17:14.150 And one thing I wanna pointout, and this is just crazy.00:17:16.050 Community edition is $0 and includes allfeatures of enterprise  right.00:17:20.730 Then one of the main limits is thatyou are limited to five simultaneous00:17:23.690 sessions and excludes somebranding and web categorization,00:17:26.650 which is what I just hit. Actually,00:17:28.550 we can't take advantage of some crazyURL filtering your web categorization,00:17:32.110 but we get some pretty coolstuff anyway. And of course,00:17:34.080 if you wanna goprofessional or enterprise,00:17:35.900 and if you're a businessschool or government entity,this is perfect for you.00:17:38.820 But anyways, let's continueanyways. That's all we care about.00:17:40.760 I'm gonna click on submit. Andthen one more thing we have to do.00:17:42.920 We have to apply this policyto our users to do that.00:17:45.240 We'll go over here tothe left, to our images.00:17:47.390 This will be applied per imageand I'll find, for example, brave,00:17:50.330 let's go and click on brave clickon the icons here, click on edit.00:17:53.340 And if I scroll down justa bit and when I say a bit,00:17:55.560 I mean a lot  wehave the web filter policy.00:17:57.830 I'll change this from inheritto my, there it is right there.00:18:00.800 My test one and click on http://submit.so/ now let's give it a test.00:18:03.920 I wanna go ahead and launch brave.00:18:05.020 It should apply to me as well andright off the bat access tonight.00:18:08.570 So I try to go to Googleor Facebook, nothing,00:18:12.010 but I try to go to network chuck.com.What if I try to go to network http://chuck.com/.00:18:15.930 Hey, real quick, Cameronand Chuck from the future,00:18:18.170 we figured out that it doesn'twant the HTTPS in there at all.00:18:20.850 So go ahead and take that out and justhave the domain name in there soon.00:18:24.270 Now let's go back to our workspaces.Find our brave web browser,00:18:27.450 go and launch the sucker. It shouldwork for me. You should block me.00:18:30.140 I am all users and by default it shouldblock the first website it comes with.00:18:33.260 Yeah, access denied. But now if we goto network, chuck.coffee, for example,00:18:38.980  naked by coffee. No http://problem.my/ daughters can too. Now it was cool.00:18:42.540 And check this out. If I go back to mydashboard and I go to my admin portal,00:18:45.320 if I scroll it like notice real quick,00:18:47.240 we have insight into everything goingon with thought our chasm instance here,00:18:51.010 or our chasm server, all theimage usage, all the errors.00:18:53.990 And then down here atthe bottom domain usage,00:18:56.190 we can track what our people are going to.00:18:58.510 So think about thatfrom a user perspective,00:18:59.830 as you're trying to protect your company'susers, uh, or your kids or whatever,00:19:04.030 you get a crazy amount of insight andcontrol. Okay, I gotta stop there.00:19:08.050  there are a ton more featuresI could talk of about like casting,00:19:11.240 which you can share your session withother people and they can watch you do00:19:13.640 stuff, uh, staging, which is crazy. Makesthings go faster, just so much more.00:19:17.800 I can't go into it. And by the way,if you do want to go into that,00:19:20.400 if you wanna learn how to do this,we'll have a little minicourse below.00:19:23.200 Check it out.00:19:23.860 But now I wanna change gears for asecond because I've shown you some cool00:19:26.400 stuff.00:19:26.640 I've shown you two use cases like securebrowsing and having a really awesome00:19:30.200 line X distro, just bamexploded onto your browser.00:19:33.770 But how do companies use this? Howcould you use it as a, a daily grind?00:19:37.610 How can you apply it to what you do now?00:19:39.840 There are some pretty cool use casesabove and beyond what we've already showed00:19:43.590 you. So now I'm gonna kickit off to Cameron. Cameron,00:19:45.580 show the people some cool stuff I'mgonna see Beardie  right.00:19:48.990 So now that we're done going over justpersonal use case for like browser00:19:51.970 isolation, or maybe standing upyour own call Linux or Rubi desktop,00:19:55.270 there are some more use cases forthis that are a little less personal,00:19:58.170 more like business or enterprise suchas replacing your VDI solution. Uh,00:20:03.060 maybe your company right now usesCitrix. Citrix can be really cumbersome,00:20:06.730 hard to set up licensing. It'shard. What's great about it.00:20:09.980 That it's web native.00:20:10.500 You don't have to have anything asstalled on your endpoints in order to use00:20:12.940 chasm, you can have it justrun through any web browser,00:20:15.480 because if you ever use Citrixor any of the other stuff,00:20:17.530 you have to install crapon people's computers.00:20:19.130 It sucks and worry aboutversioning on the desktops, blah,00:20:23.530 none of that and chasms images areall secure outta the box because they00:20:27.530 constantly update theirrolling images every night,00:20:29.530 because the old way to do stuff is stupid.00:20:32.700 You would have a golden image thatadmins would like go into log into and00:20:36.240 update, like apply updatesand apply the patches of crap.00:20:39.230 This is like it's auto magic, automagic, and last but not least,00:20:43.760 it could be used for DevOps pipelines.00:20:45.440 So whether you want to testyour own custom doc Docker, ah,00:20:48.270 docking Docker containers or your code,00:20:51.020 you can use their secure APIs that areprovided with chasm to test that. Thanks,00:20:54.560 Cameron. All right. So chasm seriously.00:20:57.420 I'm gonna probably usethis every single day.00:20:59.700 I'm legit gonna have mykids use it. Cameron,00:21:01.200 you're gonna use this thing always,always forever. And I I'm being serious.00:21:04.520 I do just constantly spinup news stuff, new VMs.00:21:07.930 And this is a way easier way to do this.00:21:09.670 If I just wanna test something realquick or if I wanna browse to kind of a00:21:12.990 weird URL and not worryabout getting hacked,00:21:15.850 not to mention all the crazy usecases that Cameron mentioned,00:21:18.900 it's a pretty cool thing.00:21:19.710 So thanks again to chasm workspaces forsponsoring this video and making such a00:21:23.390 freaking cool product and like, yeah,I know they did sponsor this video,00:21:26.650 but I only say yes to things I reallylike and enjoy and will actually use00:21:30.820 myself, especially when it's free andaccessible to pretty much everybody.00:21:34.160 So I dunno what you're waiting for.If you haven't already tried it,00:21:36.060 if you didn't followalong this video, do it.00:21:38.800 And it's right now right now is whenyou gotta do it. And if you did it,00:21:42.460 let me know what you thoughtcomment below and uh, by the way,00:21:45.770 have you hacked YouTube algorithmstoday? Let's make sure you do that.00:21:49.250 Like button notification, bellsubscribe, and already said comment.00:21:52.270 So just do that. You gotta hack YouTubetoday. Ethically of course. And yeah,00:21:56.650 that's all I got. Thanks again to mybrother, Cameron, for helping out today.00:22:00.470 Let me know again, if you wanna seemore of him, if you don't, I don't care,00:22:03.130 I'll still include him. Oh. Andalmost forgot by the way. Um,00:22:06.210 we are gonna include more tutorials,more of a deep dive on chasm,00:22:09.680 how to do all the kind of crazy cool stuffthat we didn't include in this video.00:22:13.250 Check it out. Link below. It'll be partof my network, Chuck premium membership,00:22:17.240 which if you don't know whatthat is, it's 12 bucks a month.00:22:19.500 You get access to a ton of cool stuff.00:22:21.260 And it's just a way to support whatI do here. A way to support Cameron,00:22:24.070 what he does here and of courseget access to cool things. Yeah,00:22:27.280 that's all I got today.All right. Talk to Y.00:22:49.060 Okay."
