==**The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right**==

  

==**When you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the behaviour as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren’t perfect.**==

  

==**Once a habit has been established, it’s important to continue to advance in small ways. These little improvements and challenges keep you engaged. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a flow state**==

==**A flow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and fully immersed in an activity**==

  

==**They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4% beyond your current ability.**==

  

==**In real life it’s typically not feasible to quantify the difficulty of an action in this way, but the core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just manageable difficulty, something on the perimeter of your ability, seems crucial for maintaining motivation**==

  

==**Improvement requires a delicate balance. you need to regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress to stay motivated.**==

  

==**Behaviours need to remain novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety we get bored.**==

  

==**And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self improvement**==

### How to stay focused when you get bored working on your goals

  

==**Many of us get depressed when we lose focus or motivation because we think that successful people have some bottomless reserve of passion. But successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom**==

  

> ==**Mastery requires practice**==

  

==**But the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes**==

  

> ==**The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom**==

  

==**We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty**==

  

==**As soon as we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy, even if the old one was still working**==

  

==**Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly**==

  

==**Perhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are those that provide continuous forms of novelty. Video games provide visual novelty. Porn provides sexual novelty. Junk food provide culinary novelty. Each of these experiences offer continual elements of surprise**==

  

==**In psychology, this is known as a variable reward.**==

  

==**The sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and failure. Half of the time you get what you want. Half of the time you don’t. You need just enough “winning” to experience satisfaction and just enough “wanting” to experience desire.**==

  

==**This is one of the benefits of following the Goldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested in a habit, working on challenges of just manageable difficulty is a good way to keep things interesting.**==

  

==**Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement**==

  

> ==**You have to fall in love with boredom**==

  

==**But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur**==

  

==**Professionals stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose, amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life**==

  

==**When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood. Professionals take action even when the mood isn’t right. They might not enjoy it, but they find a way to put the reps in**==

  

==**The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom**==
