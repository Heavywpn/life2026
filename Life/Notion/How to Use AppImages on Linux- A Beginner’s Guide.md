Transcipt: Intro0:01[Music]0:08[Music]0:14hello again everyone and welcome back to0:16learn Linux TV in today's video what0:19we're going to do is check out app0:21Images an app image is a form of0:24software delivery it's basically an0:26all-in-one package a universal package0:28you download it run it and it's as0:30simple as that in this video what I'm0:33going to do is teach you everything that0:35you need to know to use app Images0:37you'll know what they are in the first0:39place how they work and why you might0:41want to consider using app Images over0:43other types of Linux packaging now if0:46you're not already familiar with the0:47concept Universal packages are a0:50relatively New Concept in Linux and the0:52idea is to have software being packaged0:54in a way where the drro doesn't matter0:57so that effectively means you could have0:58one application and it could run on just1:01about any distribution and this approach1:03is great for developers too because it1:05takes the dro out of the equation so if1:07someone is developing an app for Linux1:09then they only need to develop one thing1:11to Target the entirety of the Linux1:13community and then when it comes to you1:15the user you benefit because it doesn't1:17matter which distribution you run your1:19choice is respected you could use1:20anything you want and then you could1:22bring your applications with you and app1:25Images are one of three main types of1:27universal packages we have snap snap1:30packages flat packs and of course app1:32Images I already have videos in this1:35series on Snap packages and flat packs1:37so I'll leave a card for the snap video1:39right about here if you want to check1:41that out anyway I can't wait to dive inThe ad1:44but before I do I need to take a moment1:46and let you guys know that I have two1:47brand new courses available over on UD1:49to me first if you're in the process of1:52learning Linux for the very first time1:53you should definitely check out my Linux1:55Essentials course not only will this1:57course teach you everything you need to1:58know to get started Ed and learn the2:00basics of Linux it's also going to help2:02you get certified and earn your Linux2:04Essentials credential through LPI and2:07the Linux professional Institute is the2:08world's largest Linux and open source2:10focused vendor neutral certification2:12body so by earning certifications2:14through LPI your credentials will be2:16recognized around the world but even if2:19you don't have any interest in getting2:20certified this course is still a great2:22fit for those of you that are getting2:23started with Linux because it'll teach2:25you all the basics also I recently2:28released an anable course as well which2:30will teach you everything you need to2:31know to get up and running with anible2:33anible is one of if not the most popular2:35configuration and automation Platforms2:37in the Linux ecosystem so it's2:39definitely something that you need to2:41learn anible is a powerful and easy2:43tolearn platform that'll enable you to2:45automate even the most complicated Linux2:47Administration tasks and just like with2:50my Linux course each lesson will break2:52down even the most complicated2:53components and Concepts into easy to2:56understand lessons and by the end of the2:57course you'll learn everything that you2:59need to know know to use anible as part3:01of your daily tool set and as usual3:03thank you guys so much for supporting3:05Linux learning I really appreciate that3:07now it's time to dive into app images3:09and learn all about them so let's getWhat is an "AppImage"?3:15started so here we have an app image now3:18at first it doesn't look like much but3:20believe it or not this one file is a3:23complete application specifically Caden3:25live Caden live is an application you3:27could use to edit video in in fact I've3:30used Kaden live for many of the videos3:32on this channel before switching to D3:34Vinci resolve now this particular app3:36image I downloaded from the official3:38website so one thing to know about app3:40Images is that they could come from just3:42about anywhere often you'll find app3:44images on a developer's website when3:46they're making a program available and3:47it's not all that dissimilar to Windows3:50and Mac OS when you discover a new3:51application you download it you install3:53it but in this case we have an app image3:55so how do we go about running this well3:58the first thing we need to do is right3:59click on4:01it then we'll check the4:04properties and this might look different4:06for you depending on your desktop4:07environment but basically we want to go4:09to4:10permissions and we want to allow4:12executing as a program so I'll check4:15this right here and that's all we need4:17to do to make an app image work4:19seriously that's it so all we have to do4:22is just click on it like we would any4:24other4:26application so right here we have Caden4:29live how cool is4:30that now one thing to point out is that4:34I've created a directory called4:37applications it's very common when you4:39use app Images to want to save them all4:40in one place it doesn't really matter4:42where you save them you can even save4:44them in your home directory on your4:45desktop it doesn't really matter but4:47what I like to do is create a folder a4:49Parent Directory basically where all of4:51my app Images are going to live so we4:54only have this one right here so how do4:57we go about downloading an app image asHow do you generally obtain an AppImage?5:00I mentioned one of the most popular5:01places to find an app image is the5:03official website for whatever5:04application you're trying to install so5:07let's bring up a web5:10browser and here we have the browser so5:13what I'm going to do is just search for5:15bit5:16Worden then here's the official website5:18so I'll click on5:20that what we'll do is go to5:23download scroll down a bit here and you5:26can see that we have downloads for5:28Windows Mac OS and Linux so what I'm5:31going to do is click on5:35Linux and already I'm downloading an app5:37image seriously check this5:39out by default bit Wen is released as an5:42app image it's not the only way that you5:44could install bit Wen but it is a5:46popular way and it's available right5:48from the developer's website so we know5:50it's official we always want to make5:52sure that we're downloading applications5:53from official sources and it doesn't get5:56any more official than the official5:57website for the product so let's go6:00ahead and go back to our file manager6:03here and what I'm doing right now is6:05just grabbing it from my downloads6:06directory and I'm pasting the app image6:09into my applications directory and now6:11we have it so just like before I'm going6:13to right click on it I'm going to go6:16down to6:18properties let's allow executing as a6:22program we'll close it I'll just simply6:25click on6:28it and there you go bit Warden is now6:31running I didn't install it so there's6:33no installation procedure all I had to6:35do was download the app image make it6:37executable and I'm done and that's oneMore specifics regarding AppImages6:40of the main benefits of the app image6:41format there's no runtime or anything to6:44install or set up first you just simply6:46run an app image and that's it now when6:48you compare app Images to you know snap6:51packages and flat packs those formats6:54tend to be a little bit heavier now I6:56like all the formats don't get me wrong6:58I'm not saying you should pick one over6:59the other but what I'm saying though is7:01that there are clear differences for7:03example when it comes to snap packages7:05there's the snap store so when you want7:07to download a snap package in that7:09format you have to download it from the7:11Snap Store you also have to have snapd7:13installed as well so in that case there7:15is something that you need to install7:17first when it comes to Flat pack you7:19don't have to get flat packs from the7:21flathub App Store quote unquote App7:24Store and you do need to have flat pack7:25installed first before you can install a7:28flat pack but again with app Images you7:30don't have to install anything but one7:32of the bigger downsides of the app image7:34format is the7:36inconsistency for example earlier in the7:38video I downloaded Caden live and I ran7:41that when I did so it didn't ask me if I7:43wanted a desktop shortcut or an7:45application menu shortcut it just ran7:48and the problem here is if I check my7:50applications list it's not going to be7:52visible because it's not actually7:54installed and that kind of makes sense7:56because an app image is well just a file7:59there really isn't anything to install8:01so that's why we don't have a desktop8:03icon however some applications will ask8:06you if you want to integrate the8:08application which means create a desktop8:10or application launcher8:12shortcut now even though not every app8:15image will prompt you to create an8:17application launcher there is a8:19workaround and it's called app image8:21launcher and I already have it8:23downloaded right here I'm going to leave8:24a link to this in the description down8:26below but this is going to be a8:28distribution package this time note the8:30Deb format here in my case so when you8:33install app image launcher it basically8:35manages all of this for you so I'm just8:37going to install it right8:39now now the package is installed but8:42there's not really a whole lot to see8:44this is going to run in the background8:47but basically what that will do is8:49intercept the fact that we are opening8:50an app image so it'll see that we're8:53opening one and if a launcher isn't8:55already on the system for whatever one8:57we're launching it's going to give us an8:59option to create that so for example9:02what I'll do is open Kaden live9:04again and we see immediately that app9:07image launcher saw that we were9:09launching an app image and sprang into9:12action so right now it's going to see9:15the folder that we're currently inside9:17of and just assume that that's the9:18folder where all of our app Images are9:20going to be you could customize this and9:23you should customize this if you want to9:24put them somewhere else but that's okay9:26for me so I'll just click okay and right9:29now it's offering to integrate it for us9:31we could run once or integrate it into9:33our system run once is useful if you9:36only plan on running an app image just9:38one time but if you plan on keeping it9:40around you might want to click this9:41button right9:46here now we see that the app image is9:50launching and when I try to open9:53applications we can see that Caden live9:55is listed right there so as you can see9:58even though there's some downsides with10:00app Images there's some easy workarounds10:02to make it even10:04better now before I close out the videoAppImage Hub10:07I just wanted to show you guys one more10:08thing and that is the app image Hub so10:11even though there's no one app store for10:14app images and you could also download10:16them from the vendor's website most of10:18the time you'll also find app Images10:20here as well and this might be a good10:22place to start so let's click browse all10:28apps and and you can see that there's10:30quite a few listed10:31here now obviously I can't show you all10:34of them there's over 1,300 app images on10:36the site but if you're looking for a10:38good place to start then app image Hub10:41might be a great place I'll be sure to10:43have a link in the description down10:44below if you want to check it10:48out and there you go we just took a look10:51at app images in this video I love app10:53Images they're just so cool it's a10:55wonder why they're not more popular10:57hopefully this video will increase their10:59popularity because I think it's11:01definitely something that you should11:02check out anyway thank you so much for11:04checking out this video I really11:06appreciate it and I'll see you in the11:07next video11:10[Music]11:25[Music]English (auto-generated)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j7lwauJN2shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j7lwauJN2s
