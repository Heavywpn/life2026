I've been00:00:01.959 using notion wrong for months why well00:00:04.880 I've been stuck in the past failing to00:00:06.759 see how easily notion Ai and some other00:00:09.240 quick shortcut features can massively00:00:11.480 Save Us hours and optimize our workflow00:00:14.480 now like me you might have been dubious00:00:16.520 as to how usable AI actually was in00:00:18.920 notion after hours of experimenting00:00:21.279 these are the best ways to use it that00:00:23.519 actually work saving you time and00:00:25.720 improving the quality of your work in00:00:28.000 notion00:00:30.960 so let's start to harness those hidden00:00:32.880 powers of notion to make your notion00:00:35.079 workspace life OS template wink or00:00:38.480 notion second brain both easier to use00:00:41.360 and more powerful I mean these days it00:00:43.559 can even talk to you stick around for00:00:45.640 that and thank you to short form my00:00:47.840 other secret productivity tool for00:00:50.079 sponsoring this video this first one is00:00:53.039 a very exciting Discovery for me the new00:00:55.640 AI database properties are great and can00:00:58.199 help you a huge amount but often feel a00:01:00.440 bit generic and meaningless when used as00:01:03.039 a simple summary unless you Embrace how00:01:05.640 to customize them let me show you then00:01:07.720 some amazing examples that have been big00:01:09.880 news for me with how I've been using00:01:12.400 notion AI to manage my YouTube video00:01:14.920 creation from scripting through to00:01:16.680 managing projects with collaborators so00:01:19.000 if we click to my content manager you'll00:01:21.360 see all of my current videos including00:01:23.280 the one we're working on and this is00:01:24.720 where I run my channel now at the moment00:01:26.720 I'm working on creating a help Bop for00:01:29.479 my life OS template users to assist them00:01:32.200 something that can direct people to the00:01:33.960 relevant notion videos in my library00:01:36.439 which is here that link to specific00:01:38.399 templates I mentioned for example right00:01:40.560 down here I have all of my published00:01:43.119 videos with the links notion AI has00:01:45.680 helped this massively in the content00:01:47.799 manager so if we click on my simplified00:01:50.159 notion life OS tour you'll see that I00:01:52.159 have here a AI content summary tool this00:01:56.360 was generated by AI it is summarizing00:01:59.280 the title of the video it's putting the00:02:00.880 URL an intro to what happens talking00:02:03.399 about what I cover and saying why people00:02:05.600 should watch if I click in here and we00:02:07.880 edit the property we have an AI autofill00:02:11.200 and within this I can list a custom00:02:13.720 autofill so please do the following00:02:16.000 write the video title and URL then00:02:18.000 summarize the content of the following00:02:19.720 sections and then finally a subheading00:02:21.840 of why to watch and share some00:02:23.440 information on why people might enjoy00:02:25.080 watching it so what that's actually00:02:26.480 doing is down here we have in scripting00:02:29.680 we have the hook and setup here that I00:02:32.120 wrote as a script and we have a list of00:02:34.480 everything that I cover in the video00:02:36.440 planned out when I did my tour of this00:02:38.959 simplified life OS that I made and it00:02:41.200 summarized all of those details I've00:02:43.480 also created a property which is a00:02:45.879 custom auto and I've listed in here what00:02:48.959 to generate you're an expert in SEO00:02:50.959 create a YouTube description for the00:02:53.640 video and it can actually generate00:02:55.720 things as well let's give it a go you'll00:02:57.360 see it is writing out the video title00:03:00.519 it's suggested some sections and it's00:03:02.680 given me some keywords that is a huge00:03:04.560 amount of work for me normally which I00:03:06.239 can now work from in that video and I'm00:03:09.040 ready to rock so if you wanted to do00:03:11.040 this you would simply create whatever00:03:13.280 database that you want you would select00:03:15.480 a new property and you have these00:03:17.280 options up here for AI keywords00:03:19.440 translation custom autofill and AI00:03:21.560 summary I think this one is really00:03:23.440 powerful so if in my content manager I00:03:25.519 wanted to add a new one let's say I00:03:27.120 wanted keywords for each I could select00:03:29.159 the AI keywords option can see more00:03:31.680 details about it what to00:03:33.599 generate let's try00:03:35.640 it and you can see in here we now have00:03:38.680 if I wrap the column a list of keywords00:03:41.879 so this could be great in a larger00:03:43.560 system maybe you'd want to use it in a00:03:45.120 journal and you could add in keywords00:03:47.519 into the system and do it all00:03:49.040 automatically but even more remarkable00:03:50.959 for a while I found that notion AI could00:03:53.280 actually go further than this so if I00:03:55.040 open up this iPad accessories video00:03:57.200 there's my content summary as we've set00:03:59.519 but below it I've got this a final video00:04:02.480 description and it seemed strangely that00:04:05.159 it would reach outside the system it has00:04:07.400 since weirdly stopped working so this is00:04:09.480 an unconfirmed bit of info and in fact00:04:11.920 occasionally notion AI has raised an00:04:13.560 error saying it couldn't look at00:04:15.200 external URLs but take a look at this00:04:17.358 example what I've done with this if we00:04:19.399 look at the property final video00:04:21.079 description it says using the URL00:04:23.479 property link please find the video00:04:25.280 description for that link on YouTube and00:04:27.600 share the text from that video descript00:04:29.680 description in this property and it's00:04:31.600 genuinely done that this is the00:04:33.720 description for my video listing00:04:36.440 everything into it including all of my00:04:38.360 links to the products if I now jump to00:04:40.759 the YouTube page there it all is there00:04:43.720 is all the information that we listed in00:04:46.639 it so leave me a comment below if you00:04:48.440 found any other unexpected use cases and00:04:51.240 do give this a go and let me know if it00:04:52.880 works for you I've also used the key00:04:54.960 info option to list key topics on my00:04:57.280 clippings and notes pages and love the00:04:59.800 summary feature for journaling templates00:05:02.479 to Summarize each entry in a gallery00:05:04.960 view so I've been using this in my00:05:07.039 notion Essentials template so I've got00:05:09.160 all these different templates you can00:05:10.720 put the template in fill it out and then00:05:13.160 you will see the summary of what you've00:05:14.560 written in here but for example maybe00:05:16.680 you wanted to create a AI categories00:05:18.639 thing we could add a property here new00:05:20.840 property and we'll do AI keywords multi00:05:25.680 select and let's call this AI category00:05:30.680 something like that save the changes try00:05:34.080 on this page and if we now show it in00:05:36.639 here there you go it's coming up and you00:05:38.800 can add really quickly AI keyword00:05:41.680 summaries into the system you can check00:05:43.840 out my notion Essentials templates via00:05:45.960 the link below if you want to try any of00:05:47.840 these out now use case number two for00:05:49.639 you life OS and second brain users is00:05:51.880 that these summary properties get even00:05:53.840 cooler if we use AI from notion00:05:57.759 alongside save to notion to summarize00:06:00.400 clipping so if we jump to a web page you00:06:04.000 can download the Chrome extension for00:06:05.600 save to notion and you can create these00:06:07.360 forms right which are rather good and00:06:09.400 it'll link things in and include stuff00:06:11.440 in so what I want to do is I'm going to00:06:13.000 add a new property to that database add00:06:15.800 a new property and we'll make that a00:06:18.680 simple AI00:06:20.840 summary how about this summarize in00:06:23.800 bullet points the key information and00:06:25.720 lessons from the page material and00:06:27.840 reference any other possible page pages00:06:29.840 in my workspace that could be relevant00:06:31.520 to it so I'm going to save that there00:06:34.120 and what we'll do is we'll jump to here00:06:37.639 back to our page and our save to notion00:06:40.199 option I'm going to add a new field in00:06:42.240 here and I'm going to find the AI00:06:44.759 summary option there it is and we want00:06:47.280 to put all of the00:06:48.800 content web page content is going to go00:06:51.120 in and I'm going to save it so it's web00:06:53.120 page content it's all ready to go and00:06:55.479 maybe I will give this a status of on00:06:58.160 reading list so I can up up date it all00:07:00.039 in there then you save it to your00:07:02.879 workspace and now if we jump back there00:07:05.000 it is so there's all the information if00:07:06.800 we then get that to do its thing it00:07:09.240 summarizes everything within that page00:07:11.759 this is a brilliant use of AI to clean00:07:14.680 up the way you look at your information00:07:17.120 so notion AI is $10 for the add-on but00:07:20.680 if you see the value that is an amazing00:07:22.879 deal okay so that's cool but we can go00:07:25.800 further and actually talk to your00:07:27.879 workspaces to explore all the knowledge00:07:30.479 within them more on that later in the00:07:32.560 video but first let's look at a few of00:07:35.120 the latest quick and simple tricks that00:07:37.240 I've found that can also speed up how00:07:40.080 you use notion not just AI so my00:07:43.240 favorite new feature has got to be this00:07:45.599 if I go into my sidebar and I want to00:07:48.319 open something in a new tab press00:07:50.080 command and then click it and it opens00:07:53.039 it in a new tab that is super brilliant00:07:56.479 and on that note if I want to reference00:07:58.280 a page ever or get the link for it00:08:00.319 command L will copy it to your clipboard00:08:03.440 so that means if I go back into here00:08:05.479 command V mention the page you can very00:08:07.879 quickly create yourself a little menu00:08:10.159 using at mentions or this is just a00:08:12.440 great way to share pages with people00:08:14.319 that you're working with and finally on00:08:15.919 this list is number three AI tables and00:08:18.639 databases this one up here was created00:08:21.759 by creating a simple table and then00:08:24.639 turning it into a database so to00:08:27.199 shortcut that first part of the building00:08:29.560 process when you want to get a new00:08:31.319 bespoke nation database created this is00:08:33.880 a fantastic trick the quickest way to00:08:35.760 get into AI is just to press space and I00:08:38.320 can write what I want so I might say00:08:40.360 create a table of the top classic00:08:45.360 motorcycles from the UK and00:08:49.200 Europe let's see what that does there it00:08:52.080 goes year release best features00:08:53.519 reference URL it's creating the table00:08:56.080 and filling it out of course you would00:08:58.000 want to probably do a little bit more00:09:00.079 work on this yourself but look how fast00:09:02.440 it's creating this let's say it's done00:09:05.000 I'm then going to click on the side00:09:06.240 panel here click turn into database and00:09:08.920 just copy these into the00:09:12.200 columns and this one we will edit the00:09:15.480 property and turn it into a URL and we00:09:18.680 will delete this so it's a bit flawed00:09:20.800 but you get the idea another great tip00:09:22.839 with AI here is create yourself a00:09:25.120 database template edit the template and00:09:28.320 create yourself in here a custom AI00:09:31.160 block and then that will generate what00:09:33.160 you need into the page let us know what00:09:35.560 your favorite notion shortcuts are in00:09:37.480 the comments so we can all learn from00:09:38.800 each other and while you're there give00:09:40.360 me a thumbs up so that's got you saving00:09:42.519 some time in notion but it doesn't mean00:09:44.920 much unless the work you get done is00:09:46.800 actually meaningful so next we'll look00:09:48.760 at some notion AI features that can00:09:50.800 improve the quality of your work before00:09:52.920 that though I want to show you another00:09:54.360 app I've used for years alongside notion00:09:56.680 to improve my learning and knowledge00:09:58.519 short form and it's got its own AI00:10:00.680 features that have supercharged it even00:10:02.720 further now if you don't know by now00:10:04.560 short form is my favorite solution for00:10:06.800 recapping and discovering the key ideas00:10:09.440 in non-fiction books in advance of00:10:11.760 reading them of course and they cover a00:10:13.880 range of subjects like productivity00:10:16.320 creativity and Entrepreneurship it's00:10:18.480 more than a summary tool though and00:10:19.959 that's what's particularly cool it00:10:21.839 offers additional insights interactive00:10:24.120 exercises offering further perspectives00:10:26.279 on what you read I've recently finished00:10:28.000 reading the procrastination Cure by00:10:30.440 Daman zaharis a super useful book on00:10:33.399 understanding why we procrastinate and00:10:35.160 waste time another way to make sure you00:10:36.800 can get more done with less alongside00:10:38.440 these tricks but short form has an AI00:10:40.760 Chrome browser extension of its own and00:10:43.279 it's particularly accurate compared to00:10:45.120 others that I've tried now I'm finding00:10:47.079 it genuinely useful as a research tool00:10:49.320 to improve the quality of the content00:10:51.399 that I create it has fundamental00:10:53.040 features many AI extensions like they00:10:55.160 should generating high quality summaries00:10:57.120 for anything on the internet from emails00:10:59.320 to videos listing the key ideas and00:11:01.680 simplifying long and complicated topics00:11:04.200 but what I really like about the short00:11:06.079 form AI is the fact that it also offers00:11:08.519 additional sources that are linked to00:11:10.560 give an opportunity to learn further and00:11:12.880 gain well-rounded understandings on the00:11:14.959 subjects access to the AI extension is00:11:17.120 free but with limited accessibility and00:11:19.120 full capabilities are available with the00:11:21.120 premium subscription to short form new00:11:22.920 and existing paid premium users gain00:11:25.000 full access to the extension and short00:11:27.279 forms high quality nonf book guides so00:11:31.240 give it a try you can actually get a 20%00:11:33.760 discount to a short form premium00:11:35.320 subscription which includes that00:11:37.079 unlimited access to the AI via my link00:11:39.519 short http://form.com/00:11:40.880 creating so thank you very much to00:11:42.880 shortform for sponsoring this part of00:11:44.519 the video right back to notion and these00:11:47.000 next sections are about improving the00:11:49.600 quality of your work better00:11:51.519 collaboration this is another way that00:11:53.639 I've been using notion wrong not00:11:55.639 embracing the collaboration tools even00:11:58.600 in a personal workspace first remember00:12:01.519 that you can invite guests by clicking00:12:04.920 share up here and you can do it for free00:12:07.839 so when you jump up here you can find00:12:10.800 someone's email so let's say I wanted to00:12:12.680 invite Tom here if I click add and00:12:15.880 invite Tom it will also ask you if you00:12:18.040 want to add him to your workspace don't00:12:20.279 do that because you will end up paying00:12:22.079 for them as a member always skip that00:12:24.519 but you can still give them full access00:12:26.600 to the page which is rather good the joy00:12:29.360 that is that you can share pages and00:12:32.120 then anything within those pages those00:12:34.240 people can see as well so for example if00:12:36.720 you were using say my life OS and you00:12:39.199 shared the life OS with a person they00:12:42.800 would be able to access all of the00:12:44.680 databases within that template and you00:12:47.120 could start using it as a shared00:12:49.000 workspace for free in notion as long as00:12:51.880 you don't add them as a member recently00:12:53.560 I've been doing a complete audit of my00:12:55.800 company my work my channel and so on and00:12:58.040 so forth with an in company called the00:13:00.079 generalist Co we're doing a huge amount00:13:02.199 of work but what's really cool is that00:13:04.440 we're actually doing some commentary on00:13:06.839 things I really think you should start00:13:08.480 embracing the use of comments with00:13:10.160 people the best way to do this is to for00:13:12.519 example highlight a subject and then00:13:15.000 just click comment by using a at mention00:13:18.240 I can find my colleague Debs and I can00:13:20.680 say just showing the audience how to use00:13:24.199 comments in notion and send it and then00:13:27.839 people can reply underneath and once00:13:30.639 it's completed you can resolve it and it00:13:34.040 will disappear I've always avoided it00:13:35.760 but it's actually an excellent way to00:13:37.560 work with a guest collaborator did you00:13:39.320 know that you can use AI to generate00:13:42.440 visual data here's a little example I've00:13:44.839 created this prompt create a pie chart00:13:47.760 using mermaid which is a chart creation00:13:50.519 system you have to name the type of00:13:52.199 chart you want so I'm going to copy that00:13:54.000 paste it into Ai and press enter and00:13:56.320 watch this it will create the pie chart00:14:01.000 using Mermaid so if you can find a way00:14:03.120 to insert data and update that yourself00:14:06.519 this is a great quick way into learning00:14:08.600 to use mermaid and have data00:14:10.399 visualization in your workspace give it00:14:12.680 a go and finally chatting with your00:14:14.800 notion workspace now a lot of people00:14:17.440 down here might see this little button00:14:19.320 or you might see a sign up to the00:14:21.320 waiting list I recommend doing it00:14:23.240 because you can try this on a free00:14:24.639 account so this is the AI system so look00:14:28.079 it says hi Simon ask me about anything00:14:30.079 in better creating I'll find the answer00:14:32.639 and be able to help you do things I've00:14:34.600 only just realized the power of this00:14:36.560 it's like having a personal researcher00:14:39.079 within your workspace that can help you00:14:41.240 find things and do a lot of stuff what00:14:43.720 makes this special and different to00:14:45.279 something like chat GPT is that Q&A00:14:48.600 bases all its answers on the information00:14:51.120 in your workspace rather than the wider00:14:53.360 web this is a super powerful use case00:14:56.079 for it because it will only look for00:14:58.199 things you've got and not go wider so00:15:00.720 number one you could search your00:15:02.320 knowledge base or project back catalog00:15:04.560 so what should we say about what do I00:15:07.519 know about the par method first of all00:15:13.440 what it's doing is finding the00:15:15.480 references and then it will actually00:15:18.000 give me some direct answers now if you00:15:20.399 don't know about par it's a system to00:15:22.560 manage your projects areas resources and00:15:25.360 archives within something like a second00:15:27.440 brain now you can see that it's found a00:15:30.360 number of different sources here and you00:15:32.160 can see it is showing me also the link00:15:36.319 to the file so I can jump to it and go00:15:39.639 back to that same file where all the00:15:41.360 information was this is super powerful00:15:43.880 this combination of citation and00:15:46.279 answering but what we could also say is00:15:48.720 what videos have I created on the00:15:52.680 subject check the content database now00:15:55.279 it's not as accurate as finding00:15:57.440 something within a database yet and it00:15:59.199 also can't recognize if you say current00:16:01.360 page whilst in beta but it has done a00:16:04.040 little bit of work here look my notion00:16:06.040 life OS second brain uh and a beginner's00:16:08.880 guide and it will show me some of those00:16:10.519 things not bad now what's really nice00:16:12.600 about this window is that it will stay00:16:14.560 with you as you navigate so if I go to00:16:17.959 other pages I can continue to look at00:16:20.360 this meaning that it kind of has a00:16:21.880 memory and I can work with it as I move00:16:24.839 through my system which I think is00:16:26.839 really powerful but the great thing00:16:28.279 about this is it also works within a00:16:30.360 page using ask AI so if we look at my00:16:32.800 script and find save to notion in here00:16:34.880 we were talking about earlier I can ask00:16:37.040 AI what do I know about this and I can00:16:41.560 say look you can see where I've00:16:43.600 mentioned it in a document in fact it's00:16:46.680 in this one and I can also see that I've00:16:49.399 talked about it in various different00:16:50.800 places if I jump to my knowledge and00:16:52.639 clippings I can see my books here if we00:16:55.199 jump into say the 4-Hour Work week we00:16:58.040 can find some very ious quotes that I've00:17:00.120 taken from readwise and my Kindle to00:17:02.800 drop it in there now let's say that I00:17:04.520 wanted to take a look at an idea within00:17:06.679 this something like money I can ask AI00:17:10.119 what materials do I have on this subject00:17:11.839 for a lot of the time this is really00:17:13.760 super powerful you've got to be precise00:17:15.480 about how you use it and to be honest00:17:16.959 whilst this is a great answer it's got00:17:18.679 stuck on the current page so I'm00:17:20.119 actually going to give it a thumbs00:17:22.319 down there you go and I fed back to00:17:24.559 notion the next example for using Q&A in00:17:27.079 this is about creating proposals for00:17:29.400 projects or outlines based on your wider00:17:31.960 knowledge based so I can ask the Q&A00:17:34.360 system to draw on my existing content to00:17:36.919 create an informed outline for00:17:39.559 example I'm going to try this you're an00:17:41.960 expert in online education and social00:17:43.600 media create proposal based on my recent00:17:45.480 video scripts and YouTube projects to00:17:48.039 propose an outline for a video course00:17:51.720 called part-time productivity 101 let's00:17:54.280 try00:17:56.880 it so what's really interesting about00:17:59.520 this is this has referenced a number of00:18:01.880 things now I think this is a brilliant00:18:03.679 example of how far you can take this00:18:06.960 it's given me a introduction brain dump00:18:10.039 time management habits and getting00:18:11.600 things done minimalist productivity blah00:18:14.039 blah blah and it's referencing a number00:18:16.799 of things that I've created so I've got00:18:18.480 my skillshare course that I'm planning00:18:20.440 it's also looked at a video where I00:18:22.480 talked about this it's also found future00:18:26.480 projects that I was planning how to stop00:18:28.480 proc procastinating an old video and00:18:30.520 it's got a complete notion productivity00:18:32.679 in 60 seconds so it's referencing all of00:18:34.960 those kind of Key Systems that I've used00:18:37.159 and bits of writing and turned it into00:18:39.360 that I'm going to be using that to00:18:41.039 create myself a skillshare course and00:18:43.720 work into it so if you already have paid00:18:45.760 for the notion AI add-on you should have00:18:48.000 access to Q&A already if not just00:18:50.720 refresh your workspace but also do check00:18:53.159 if you have the option as a free user00:18:55.080 you probably do and you can use it for a00:18:57.120 limited number of entries finally be00:18:59.600 aware of the limitations of the current00:19:01.880 Q&A system in the beta version it can00:19:04.840 occasionally not find information so00:19:06.919 just give it a thumbs down and feedback00:19:09.000 if it's not right and that will help00:19:10.840 them improve it it's not great also at00:19:13.240 finding complete collections of pages if00:19:15.320 you ask to find everything on a subject00:19:17.120 it doesn't always do the full list and00:19:18.720 at the moment it can't search just00:19:20.159 within the current page it doesn't know00:19:22.000 what that means finally new data that00:19:24.000 you've added to your system might take00:19:25.720 around 30 minutes to be indexed before00:19:28.159 the system can reference it so so far we00:19:31.440 found a bunch of use cases that make00:19:33.320 notion AI worthwhile to save you time00:19:35.840 and improve what you do but there are a00:19:37.840 ton of ways that you can turn notion00:19:39.679 into the perfect personalized00:19:42.080 productivity setup say that in a hurry00:19:44.360 to do that definitely get over to better00:19:45.919 creating. comom /downloads for my free00:19:48.799 and complete life OS template systems00:19:51.240 and you
