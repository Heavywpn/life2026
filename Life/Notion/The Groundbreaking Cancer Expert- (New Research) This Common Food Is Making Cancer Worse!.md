Wisdom: '## SUMMARYProfessor Thomas Seyfried discusses cancer as a metabolic disease and advocates for metabolic therapies, including the ketogenic diet.## IDEAS:- Cancer’s rising incidence suggests lifestyle changes impact its development and prevention significantly.- Traditional views perceive cancer primarily as a genetic disorder rather than a metabolic one.- Studies show cancer is rare in traditional societies, implying diet affects cancer prevalence.- Metabolic therapy utilizes dietary changes to treat cancer more effectively than conventional methods.- A ketogenic diet lowers blood sugar, potentially reducing tumor growth and enhancing treatment efficacy.- Specific metabolic therapies can improve survival rates in terminal cancer patients significantly.- The glucose-ketone index helps monitor dietary impact on cancer progression and metabolic state.- Mitochondrial dysfunction is central to cancer development, indicating a focus on cellular metabolism.- Exercise plays a crucial role in reducing cancer risk by lowering blood sugar and glutamine levels.- Emotional stress and lack of sleep negatively affect mitochondrial health, increasing cancer risk.- Metabolic therapy can be a non-toxic alternative to conventional cancer treatments like chemotherapy.- Historical evidence suggests humans evolved with diets low in carbohydrates, impacting modern health.- The industrial food environment contributes to rising obesity and chronic diseases, including cancer.- Cancer cells thrive on glucose and glutamine, necessitating their restriction for effective treatment.- The scientific community faces resistance to the idea that cancer is primarily a metabolic disorder.- Changing dietary habits can prevent and manage cancer, emphasizing individual responsibility for health.## INSIGHTS:- Embracing a holistic understanding of cancer as a metabolic disorder can reshape treatment approaches.- Lifestyle choices significantly influence cancer risk, highlighting the importance of personal dietary decisions.- The effectiveness of metabolic therapies underscores the need for integrative medicine in cancer treatment.- Progress in cancer treatment can be achieved by refocusing on metabolic health rather than genetics.- Public health initiatives must address dietary habits to combat rising cancer rates effectively.- Understanding mitochondria’s role in energy metabolism can lead to breakthroughs in cancer management.- Encouraging healthier diets may mitigate the cancer epidemic and improve overall public health.- Personal responsibility for health choices is vital in preventing chronic diseases like cancer.- Research on cancer metabolism could revolutionize how we approach prevention and treatment.- Promoting exercise and stress management can enhance mitochondrial health and reduce cancer risk.## QUOTES:- “Cancer is very preventable when the medical establishment acknowledges what I know about this disorder.”- “Cancer was extremely rare in African tribes that were living according to traditional ways.”- “Metabolic therapy can be used as both prevention and treatment.”- “If you do metabolic therapy, you can actually reduce risk for cancer.”- “Cancer is a metabolic disorder, not just a genetic disease.”- “We can selectively restrict the two fuels while transitioning the body over to ketones.”- “The mitochondria is the center of the problem with cancer, not the nucleus.”- “Cancer cells depend on fermentation energy without oxygen.”- “Fasting is a powerful way to get your body into nutritional ketosis.”- “We evolved as a species to be in nutritional ketosis for the majority of our existence.”- “Our food science and technology has evolved faster than our biology.”- “Exercise lowers blood sugar and helps manage cancer risk.”- “Metabolic therapy is an effective non-toxic management for cancer.”- “The scientific evidence is there, and it’s just a matter of time.”- “Cancer can be managed effectively through dietary changes and metabolic therapies.”- “There’s no major advance in reducing cancer death rates.”## HABITS:- Regular exercise maintains mitochondrial health and supports overall metabolic function effectively.- Monitoring blood sugar and ketone levels can help manage cancer risk and treatment effectiveness.- Following a ketogenic diet may prevent cancer by restricting glucose and glutamine availability.- Practicing intermittent fasting can aid in achieving nutritional ketosis and improving metabolic health.- Reducing processed carbohydrates in the diet supports healthier mitochondrial function and cancer prevention.- Maintaining a balanced lifestyle includes managing stress, ensuring adequate sleep, and exercising regularly.- Engaging in community and social connections enhances emotional well-being and reduces cancer risk.- Prioritizing whole foods over processed options can improve overall health and reduce disease risk.- Staying informed about dietary impacts on health empowers better food choices and cancer prevention.- Making conscious food choices helps maintain metabolic health and support cancer management.## FACTS:- Nearly two million new cancer cases are diagnosed annually in the United States.- Approximately 1,700 people die from cancer daily in the U.S., highlighting its severity.- Cancer is projected to become increasingly prevalent globally by 2050 if current trends continue.- Traditional diets in some cultures correlate with significantly lower cancer rates.- Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to the development of various cancers worldwide.- The fermentation process is central to cancer cell metabolism, emphasizing dietary impact.- The American Cancer Society reports over 600,000 cancer-related deaths annually in the U.S.- Exercise can lower both blood sugar and glutamine, two fuels driving cancer growth.- High blood sugar levels correlate with faster tumor growth in both human and mouse studies.- Cancer cells can survive without oxygen, relying on fermentation for energy production.## REFERENCES:- "Cancer as a Metabolic Disease: On the Origin, Management, and Prevention of Cancer" by Thomas

Transcipt: 0:00cancer is very preventable when the medical establishment acknowledge what I know about this disorder what's causing0:05it and what we're not doing to prevent it or treated it it will be recognized as the greatest tragedy in the history0:10of medicine Thomas CA freed is a professor of biology genetics and biochemistry who has dedicated the past0:1630 years Gathering scientific evidence on what could be the true origin and prevention of cancer cancer is getting0:22worse and there's no major advance in reducing death rates and I can speak to the reasons for that all major cancer0:29research PL think cancer is a genetic disease you believe otherwise it's not whether you believe it's what the data0:34tell us and the evidence is massive to support that cancer is a metabolic disorder and the problem is we're doing0:40everything we possibly can in our lifestyle to induce it the scientific evidence is there like for example we0:46know that cancer was extremely rare in African tribes that were living according to the traditional ways but0:52when modern lifestyle entered into their societies cancer out of control we even did a study on THS we know that wolves0:58in the wild don't die from cancer but cancer is the number one killer of domestic dogs why it's because of our1:05lifestyle issues and a lot of us are doing things without the knowledge that it would put us at risk but with1:10metabolic therapy you can use it as both a prevention and a treatment and we're seeing more and more of terminal cancer1:15patients outliving their predictabilities because of this and let me tell you one thing and remember it if you do metabolic therapy you can1:22actually reduce risk for cancer you can take away the fear and when you say metabolic therapy tell me what those1:27things are number one before this episode starts I have a1:32small favor to ask from you two months ago 74% of people that watched this channel didn't subscribe we're now down1:38to 69% my goal is 50% so if you've ever1:44liked any of the videos we've posted if you like this channel can you do me a quick favor and hit the Subscribe button it helps this channel more than you know1:50and the bigger the channel gets as you've seen the bigger the guests get thank you and enjoy this1:58episode Professor C if someone walks up to you on the street and they're you know they know nothingWhat Would Dr Seyfried Say He Does?2:03about science and they know nothing about medicine Etc and they asked you what do you do and why do you do it how would you respond I'm a professor of2:10biology at Boston College so uh in that role I spent a lot of my time working2:16with undergraduates and graduate students in training them to be scientific literate in in various2:23aspects of biology the research program that we have at the University is also2:29Focus fed on understanding uh how to manage cancer better how it originates2:35and how to prevent it how much of a problem is cancer globally what are theHow Much Of A Problem Is Cancer Globally?2:40sort of headline statistics on the macro view of cancer for someone that really doesn't know yeah well it's getting2:46worse uh I can't say there it's in the millions I I I know precisely what's2:52going on in this country because the American Cancer Society uh every year uh2:57distributes the data on on cancer um we have almost two million new cases3:04diagnosed per year in the United States and we have 1,700 people a day3:10dying from cancer in in the United States which comes to about 70 people3:15per hour in the United States now when I went to China I looked at some numbers3:22there and it was 8,000 people a day are dying from cancer obviously the population is so much3:28larger and uh I don't know what it is in the UK I mean we'd have to go to their cancer3:34Registries but but what we do know is that it's supposed to be a lot worse by3:392050 than it is today so there seems to be no reduction in death suffering for3:45this disease and I I can speak to the the reasons for that but right now I3:51would say it's a global uh epidemic of cancer it's not it's not getting better it's getting worse more people are dying3:57from it there's no major advance in in reducing death rates so it's a great4:03tragedy so um and when we when we understand what's causing it and what4:08we're not doing to prevent it or treat it it'll it'll be recognized as the singular greatest tragedy in the history4:14of of medicine worldwide when it when when they come to know what I know about this disorder and then they realize what4:21we've been doing in in in in in a misdirected way it will be recognized as4:26the greatest tragedy in the history of medicine what Tye types of cancer are people dying from what is the mostWhat Types Of Cancer Are People Dying From?4:32popular types of cancer for men and women well it's always been lung cancer pretty much for men and women uh lung4:38cancer has always been the number one but but we have pancreatic breast cancer colon cancer these are all on the rise4:45colon cancer is on the rise pancreatic cancer is on the rise in this country I I I I can't speak for other countries4:52they may dare very slightly due to diet lifestyle issues but lung cancer has always been recognized as as the number5:00one cancer how many people in the United States then based on the statistics would develop cancer well it seems toHow Many People Will Develop Cancer?5:07increase every year so it's kind of a moving Target it doesn't seem to go down5:13you know what it is today I don't know but what I do know is the numbers of people that are dying each day because5:19the um American Cancer Society comes out with I think it's 612,0005:25people uh will die this year 2024 uh from cancer5:30in this year so divide it by 365 and it comes out to just about 1,700 people a5:36day divide that number by 24 and you get about 70 people an hour based on the5:41numbers provided to us from the American Cancer Society when they say we've made5:47major advances in man in cancer incidences right so in the 1990s they5:53instituted the uh anti-smoking campaigns all right so today if you read they say5:59we have reduced cancer deaths by 30 31 or 32% wow that sounds really impressive6:06so what they do is they take the number this is what the national the American Cancer Society has done and published in6:12their papers okay if we didn't stop smoking in the 90s and everybody6:18continued to smoke the trajectory would be very very high because we stopped6:23smoking or this it's we have 33% lower death than if we didn't stop smoking but6:30the trajectory is continuing to increase maybe not as steep as it would have been had we continued to smoke so it's it was6:36clearly a prevention it had nothing to do with a a treatment it had to do with prevention that was giving the the the6:43oh we've made major advances in in reducing cancer death rate yeah because people sto smoking for the mo for many6:49many people more people would have died had they not smoked so we have um people6:55that are not not real people we're just looking at what would have happened if if we didn't stop smoking what are theWhere Does Cancer Rank In The Probabilities Of Taking My Life?7:02leading causes of death worldwide in terms of diseases is is I I hear that7:07heart disease is number one I think that's heart disease is number one uh cancer is number two okay and there are7:15many different types of cancer right there's hundreds of different forms of cancer if you look under the electron7:21microscope or a correction even a light micro this is how most cancers are diagnosed by by light7:27microscopy uh you look under the microscope and you see a bunch of cells that are dysmorphic in the way they look7:33and then they all have genetic defects and all this kind of stuff but they all have one thing in common they depend on7:39a on a fermentation energy without oxygen so all cancers are a singular type of disease it's just that they7:46happen in different tissues but when you look at the underlying problem they're all very very similar they can't live uh7:51without a fermentation which means energy without oxygen so that's the common pathophysiological problem in all7:58cancers whether it's a colon brain breast bladder skin uh lung we we've8:04looked at all these cancers and they're all they're all essentially using the same mechanism to to grow out of control8:11so what is that F fermentation you mentioned fermentation is energy without oxy what does that mean uh we breatheWhat Is The Fermentation Process?8:17air and we uh exhale CO2 and water vapor and those are the waste products of the food that we eat we break everything is8:24broken down and combusted in our mitochondria of the cell and the waste products are Co 2 and water Vapors those8:31are the waste products but if you and I were to stop breathing for any8:36particular time period uh uh our bodies would fill up with uh lactic acid and8:42succinic acid like if we were to have a heart attack or when somebody has a heart attack um they don't die instantly8:49uh if if they if they're there without for five or seven minutes without oxygen they they may die because the brain dies8:55but if you can get the heart to beat again and get oxygen back in the system you can come alive again but when we9:01have that massive Interruption of oxygen into our body um the cells fall back on9:08an ancient they up they immediately turn on these ancient Pathways to get energy9:14without oxygen for a short period of time and that's the sugar glucose which9:19is already in our bloodstream from the food we eat and the amino acid glutamine which is a high amino acid in our9:26bloodstreams highest level of amino acid is the glutamine these two fuels are now9:32burned for energy obtain energy without oxygen there's no there's a these9:37Pathways upregulate and you can get ATP which is energy to keep you alive for a short period of time but your9:43bloodstream is filling up with the waste products called lactic acid and succinic acid lactic acid is coming from glucose9:51to sugar and succinic acid is coming from the amino acid glutamine and they build up and that tells you you're9:57fermenting you're getting energy without oxygen because you're not breathing very simple you're not breathing but I'm Not10:02Dead Yet now of course if you don't get it for very long you die it's just that10:07now the other way you can stop uh oxygenation in our bodies quickly is10:13with the poison cyanide so if we God forbid we were to take cyanide we'd be10:18both dead within within a minute we just just because our bodies are completely shut down of energy from oxygen now10:26here's the cancer cell the cancer cell lives in in can live in in cyanide10:32cyanide does not kill a tumor okay War a warberg showed this a long time ago and we've also shown the same thing in our10:39lab others have shown this the interesting thing is when you look at cancer cells even in the presence of10:44oxygen even in oxygen they're throwing out lactic acid and succinic acid what10:49does that mean that means the en the organ organel inside the cell that10:55generates energy is not efficient it's inefficient and the cells are using11:00ancient fermentation and when I say ancient fermentation you have to realize the Earth is 4 and a half billion years11:06old um the organisms that existed on our planet uh two and a half billion years11:12ago were all fermenters there was no oxygen in the atmosphere till the photosynthetic bacteria started making11:18oxygen they were living cells they had no oxygen and they were growing like11:23crazy unregulated growth just unreg what's going on here and they would die11:28as soon as the mble fuels were dissipated as they gobbled up everything they would just die so they lived as11:34long as they could reproduce and have fermentation fuels the cancer cell in our body is doing nothing than falling11:40back on these ancient fermentation Pathways that become accelerated up regulated in the tumor cell because the11:48efficiency of the energy coming from the mitochondria is now uh depleted it's11:53defective in many different ways so this is very clear and this happens in lung cancer colon canc we've looked at all12:00the major Cancers and we found out these common defects are seen in all the cancers so they're all very similar in12:06their metabolism they're very different in what they look like under the microscope lung doesn't look like colon doesn't look like brain um they're very12:13different genetically they're all different from each other but they're all common in a in a dependency on thisHow Have You Arrived At This Conclusion?12:19ancient pathway of energy metabolism can you take me back you mentioned a guy called Walberg there yeah can you take12:26me back on the journey that the scientific community or at least you have been on to arrive at the conclusion12:31that the central sort of causal Factor at least an indication of a causal factor of cancer lies in this shift in12:38Energy Systems where did this understanding start in in research well it started with Oto warberg for sure uh12:44in the 1920s uh the other linkage before I tell you what OT warberg did because I12:50was like everybody else I thought cancer was a genetic disease and and I heard about warberg didn't really know what12:56what he was talking about or invested any time thinking about what he said but13:01Linda nebling was a PhD nursing student at Case Western Reserve University and13:07in Ohio and she took these two little hopeless kids brain cancer we call13:12hopeless cases when they have no um predictability of long-term survival and13:18she gave them a ketogenic diet to lower blood sugar and she was able to rescue13:24these kids one one one eventually died the other one was lost to followup and she said it her strategy was based on13:30what OT warberg had said about glucose and cancer so then I said warberg I said who the hell what let me go back and13:37check out who this guy was and what he did because I was seeing similar things in the in the mouse with that drug it13:42was lowering glucose and and we were sh shrinking these tumor cells and we published a paper uh the first one of13:49the first ever papers linking that how high your blood sugar is determines how fast your tumor will grow in the mice13:55and now how this been replicated in all human cancers the higher your blood sugar the faster the tumor grows the14:01lower the blood sugar the slower the tumor grows undeniable for all different human Mouse cancers wow so warberg had14:09said this a long time ago back in the 1920s he he was taking slices of all14:14kinds of human and rat mouse tumors and slicing them up and he noticed something really strange about these um cancers14:22they take in less oxygen compared to the normal tissue from which they came wow14:27so they're kind of like oxygen deprived and they were throwing out this lactic acid waste product that he was that he14:33was saying and they were taking in so much more glucose than the normal so the normal cells take in just a little bit14:39of glucose and they can make tremendous energy from a tiny amount this guy was taking in huge amounts of glucose but14:45not fully metabolizing it to CO2 and water but dumping it out as lactic acid14:51which is a a breakdown product of glucose that is not fully metabolized in the cell wow he said this is14:58unbelievable and then he did all kinds of tissue I looked at his data was unbelievable he was cutting humans mice15:04rats and seeing the same thing over and over again and uh he was saying the15:09origin of cancer has to do with something in the ability of the mitochondrian the organel to generate15:16efficient energy from oxygen so the sorry the mitochondria is the part of the cell that creates energy it's the15:22part of the cell that creates energy through oxidative phosphorilation which is burning energy using oxygen okay okay15:30so it's like an engine it's an engine a very highly efficient engine that this is an organel you have to realize we15:37have the cell yeah and we have a nucleus that every everybody knows about this nucleus and then we have all these15:42little organel in there we have lomes and we have the mitochondrian which is like a spaghetti Network inside the cell15:50they fuse it's actually a second living it's a second living organism inside our cells and to simplify what they do the15:57mitochondria they convert oxygen and glucose into energy yes and they combust16:02uh energy uh they they take the foods that we eat have carbon hydrogen bonds16:07okay and we break those down inside our mitochondria and we and we and we when we break those bonds down we create a a16:14hydrogen gradient and we dissipate that gradient through an impeller mechanism that generates energy like crazy it's16:21unbelievable very efficient highly efficient but the cancer cell has corruption in that system but it doesn't16:27happen overnight as warberg said if you break that system too acutely and too fast the cell will die it doesn't have16:34the so you have to have two things to get from oxidative phosphorilation to uh16:40energy with with with minimal oxygen fermentation sorry just to keep it simple from a normal cell to a cancer16:46cell from a normal cell to a cancer cell doesn't happen overnight okay it's a chronic damage to the ability of of thatWhy Do Cancers Grow So Rapidly?16:53organel inside the cell to generate efficient energy okay so all we have to16:59know with cancer is that they're how are they growing so rapidly why are they going out of control how come it's so17:04hard to kill them because as long as you have those fermentable fuels that drive17:10this ancient fermentation pathway um they will continue to grow they're very hard to kill and the fermenting fuels17:17are glucose and and glutamine glutamine yeah okay so here let's let me tell you17:22in a nut are are you ready brace yourself are you ready I'm ready are you braced are you braced sufficiently bra17:28sufficient he's sufficiently braced okay so uh a solution to the cancer problem17:35to manage cancer without toxicity is to simultaneously restrict the two fuels17:42that are needed to drive this disregulated growth while transitioning the whole body off to a fuel that the17:49tumor cells can't use which is fatty acids and Ketone bodies so when we take17:55the cancer patients or the mice we put them into a calorie restriction lowering18:00the blood sugar uh that I said is one half of the two fuels you can lower that down really really low and then we use18:08specific drugs to Target the glutamine and together we can selectively restrict18:14the two fuels while we transition the whole body over to to ketones we as a18:20species evolved to be in nutritional ketosis for the the majority of our existence as a as a species like one and18:26a half million years for for centuries and centuries thousands and thousands of years our species you and me our18:34ancestors were always in a state of nutritional ketosis because there was very few carbohydrates in the18:40environment for them to be consuming right so the cancer cell the body you and I could if we stopped eating and we18:46took a low carbohydrate diet and just did water only fasting we would get into nutritional ketosis where the normal18:53cells our brain our kidneys our heart can be burning these Ketone bodies18:58because they have a good mitochondria and they can burn these fuels effectively the tumor cells have a bad mitochondria they can't burn those fuels19:05they're dependent on glucose and glutamine we can replace glucose and glutamine with Ketone bodies in the normal cells of our so we selectively19:12marginalize these tumor cells slowly over time uh we they slowly start to DieWhat Are Ketones?19:18the blood vessels disappear and the body comes in and dissolves them so for someone that has never heard the term19:24keto before ketosis or ketones in a simple way what are KET ketones ketones19:31are water soluble breakdown products of fatty acids okay they're beta hydroxy beate acetoacetate these are small19:38molecules that are water soluble the liver throws them out like crazy kidney a little bit but mostly liver so as I19:45told you earlier when we don't eat um you you get anxious mainly because19:52our brains are addicted to glucose it's like cocaine and nicotine and whatever19:57you start getting all antsy haven't eaten anything you know uh what's going on um so you then once the body realizes20:04you ain't going to eat anything we have to start mobilizing out of our fat resources and the fats uh go into the20:10bloodstream as triglycerides which are three fatty acids attached to a glycerol20:16backbone they go to the liver the liver chops them up and puts out these little water soluble Ketone bodies that the20:24name Ketone body is kind of a weird thing from biochemistry but but they're called Ketone bodies um and they can20:31supply the brain with energy the heart with energy and not only that they're a super fuel it's unbelievable that20:38mitochondria Burns these ketones okay but they ener remember I was talking about how energy efficient the20:43mitochondria become when they burn ketones they become even more energy efficient it's unbelievable how you you20:49they don't need as much oxygen to generate more en that's why they my colleagues called and some of the greats20:56in the bio in the biochemistry field called them super super fuel because you21:01can get more energy bang for buck burning a ketone body than you can burning a pyruvate coming from glucose21:07or even a fatty acid uh and the biochemistry for that is is interesting21:12but but the bottom line is when you transition away from these fuels to ke we don't forget we evolved our our21:19ancestors were always in a state of ketosis you get into that state by consuming very few carbohydrates andWhat Can We Learn About Cancer From Our Ancestors?21:25having a lot of energy and this is the way our ancestors were so what can we learn from our ancestors about cancer21:31how prevalent was cancer um when we look back at our ancestors if they were often in a state of ketosis yeah well um it's21:39hard to determine uh from skeletal records uh but I think we can look at U21:45um modern pop modern man who live according to their traditional ways um21:52you know uh Albert schwitzer the Great humanitarian physician went to Africa and looked at Africans that were living21:58according to the traditional ways and he said one of the weirdest things they don't have cancer it was like what what22:04uh cancer was extremely rare in Africans in ints living in in the in the areas22:12British when they came you know in in in looking at the health conditions of folks that lived in the Arctic Circle22:18cancer was not there they had other things but they didn't have cancer um Aboriginal folks so it seems as though22:25uh our living we we can't go back 50,000 years ago because we don't have people22:30to examine but we have people to examine today and that was one of the things schwitzer and several other Physicians22:36from Europe would go to Africa and they would look at these some of these tribes that were traditional and they would say22:42whoa what's going on with these Africans how come they don't have but when modern diet lifestyle entered into their22:48societies cancer out of control what about what about our the primate cousins22:54yeah um there's never been a documented uh case a breast cancer in a female23:00chimpanzee uh and they're 98% similar to us in Gene and protein sequence uh you23:05know what's going on with that um monkeys uh they don't generally form cancer they're eating they're not eating23:12what we eat okay don't forget we did not evolve to eat pork pies and Dunkin23:19Donuts jelly fil donnuts and pizzas we did not our ancestors did not eat this right we were killing and eating Animals23:26As I said we ate everything that walked crawled flew or swam on this planet became part of our diet um we did not23:33have Donuts on every corner delicate essin on every corner our we evolved over this period of time just like our23:40primate ancestors uh the animals chimps and gorillas and things that you see in23:46the zoos are fed their natural diets as if they were living in in their habitat23:51their natural habitat whether it was in South America Africa or wherever it was were're not throwing in jelly donuts23:57every day and pizza pie into the chimpanzee pen and as a matter of fact I even went to the zoo down down here in24:04in Boston Franklin Park Zoo and also at the San Diego Zoo I said how come how24:10come you guys don't give these guys run down and get a big pizza for these for these animals oh no it' be animal24:16cruelty their systems aren't Geared for this well neither are24:22we we have an obesity epidemic we have all these different chronic diseases why24:27we didn't have to eat all this crap that we're eating today so what I've told many people in these podcasts is that24:33our food science and technology and our society's technology has evolved so muchWhat Role Does Exercise Play In Fighting These Diseases?24:39faster than our biology can you explain to me in simple terms the role the exercises playing in staving of cancer24:46well exercise lowers blood sugar you know you and and also lowers glutamine so uh the two fuels that are driving uh24:53now we can't completely remove glutamine by exercise that's for sure um but we my24:58my late good friend George kahill published some papers on showing how exercise could actually lower uh25:04glutamine availability so it's a it's a little bit of a push but you're also when you exercise you're burning and25:10you're not eating a lot of carbs your mitochondria burning ketones and the oxygenation from all the exercise is25:16keeping those mitochondria super healthy at their highest level of Energy Efficiency so exercise you're building25:23muscle as well aren't you yeah you're building well you can build muscle but you're certainly getting aerobic exercise to oxygen is coming in and25:30you're burning ketones which I already told you is a super fuel so your body is super healthy uh these bodies from the25:37Paleolithic period these men were jacked there was no obesity in these people they had tremendous energy they're25:43they're not dying from uh the things that are killing us they're dying from injuries and infections when youWhat Lifestyle Choices Are Causing The Cancer To Develop?25:49described this slow and gradual shift in the cell as it moves to this sort of25:55ancient system it sounded very gradual so in my I thought okay so does that mean that the cancer is a gradual26:03process that is kind of building up in me or isn't building up in Me based on the lifestyle decisions I'm making and26:09my environmental factors right now like I'm trying to say does is does26:15cancer start slowly years before you you you know you find it is a gradual process but it can26:22be impacted by several provocative Agents from the from the micro environment um lack of exercise okay so26:30we're not exercising nearly as much as our Paleolithic ancestors Bar None right26:35we have massive amounts of processed carbs in our diets we have a lot of emotional stress uh um mental emotional26:44stress that's impacting negatively on on our biology um we we have lack of sleep26:52sleep uh a lot of us because we we have stresses you you have to have when you put all of these impact act ful things26:58together in one person you can put yourself at risk for Cancer all of which27:04will damage and reduce the efficiency of mitochondria and also the joy of living27:11uh having friends and friendships and and this kind of thing reduces stress in a lot of different ways makes people27:17enjoy getting up and and having a a nice day rather than being depressed or or these kinds of things um you put all all27:24this together and you put yourself in a a diet and lifestyle that puts you at risk for damage to oxidative27:31phosphorilation and the transition from one form of energy to a fermentation energy and what I'm trying to understand27:36is that a it's a grad a gradual transition you have to be able to do that and how long does it take for a27:43colon a group of cells in a in a in a crypt of your colon to transition from27:48one stage to another you have to be constantly under stress those cells and that organ now why somebody gets colon27:55cancer another person gets breast cancer another person gets black cancer and some person gets a brain cancer and all these different kinds of cancers what28:01whatever happened the process was dis was causing a gradual disruption of28:07oxidative phosphorilation oxidative respiration and a and a gradual transition to a fermentation like in the28:14brain the neurons rarely if ever get cancer but the gal cells that support neurons they are usually the source of28:21the origin of cancer in the brain for those kinds of cells and you can look at different cells and some are more or28:27less prone and why this guy got lung cancer from from smoking cigarettes this guy got bladder cancer from smoking28:33cigarettes how did it all start it all started from a population of cells in one of those organs having an a chronic28:41not instant a chronic Interruption of oxidative energy followed by an upregulation of this fermentation energy28:48so really we need to be thinking about all the things that have caused dysfunction in the mitochondria absolutely I want to get a list of the28:54key things that are associated with causing this dysfunction okay carcinogens okay so carcinogens and you29:00know there's many asbesto there's all kinds of chemicals in the environment you hear about this oh there's a whole29:05list of carcinogens we and they put them on the on the labels on different chemicals they say carcinogenicIs Cancer Genetic?29:11potential and whatever you have what are the types of things that are C cogenic that most people don't realize oh well29:17now we're talking about microplastics we're talking about um is that in part what causes breast cancer cuz I always29:25think about dooen with breast cancer and and the stuff that we're kind of lathering onto our arm yeah well the the29:30one that was was most interesting was the talcum powder one how does talcum powder would cause ovarian cancer okay29:37it's taken up into the urogenital tract and it forms a fosi in in a part of the29:42ovarian tissue what's a fosi a Locus like a collection of material a fosi is29:49a an area where say talum materials would be accumulating and that leads to a29:56inflammatory um area of the body and our immune30:01system comes in to see what's going on our immune system is a healing machine and they see something that's not not30:08normal normally they would clean it up but they throw grow cyto kindes and growth factors on there leading to30:14disregulated damage to mitochondria and disregulated it and then you get this tumor that starts so if I get a talcum30:21powed uh granule or whatever and it goes into my body my body then tries to30:26attack it to sort of out and in doing so it creates inflammation which leads to damage to mitochondria in a particular30:32group of cells near that fosi okay and this this is applicable to I guess a lot of different Nano particles and yeah and30:39microplastics are this now they're looking at this but then we have chemical carcinogens tetrahydrochloride there's all kinds of other things that30:45can actually damage arsenics and and these kinds of chemicals um urethane uh30:52anything that could chronically damage uh a mitochondrian forcing over time for30:58ing it to upregulate the fermentation energy without oxygen isn't this most things I'm trying to figure out what I31:04how to live my life yeah well that's what that that's why it was called the oncogenic Paradox but but you can youHow Do We Keep Our Mitochondria Healthy?31:09can avoid that that's why I'm saying if you can keep your mitochondria healthy how exercise and reduce uh consumption31:17of Highly processed carbohydrates do I need to be avoiding these microplastics as well you you know the problem with31:23microplastics they're very ubiquitous we're not really sure uh we just now becoming aware of it nobody really knew31:29that before um look it up it's but it could it could cause U small fosi in31:35different populations of cells but you know it's very hard to really chronically damage mitochondria31:41mitochondria a tough organel the problem is we are chronically abuse it without realizing what we need to do to keep it31:47healthy so even if you are exposed to chemical carcinogens even if you are exposed to all these things but you're31:53keeping your body as healthy as you possibly can you could possibly delay or31:58even prevent the damage to the mitochondria even though you have the even though you are being exposed to32:04this so it's a it's actually in your hands um you can actually reduce32:10risk for cancer by knowing what keeps your mitochondria healthy vigorous32:15exercise uh fasting water only fasting um you know it's very hard some but32:21sometimes we when we were putting mice on calorie restriction it was hard to get them to get tumors their body was so32:26healthy this was shown Years Ago by by a couple of scientists in mice using mice32:32with that developed a lot of breast cancer if you put them on a calorie restricted diet the incidence was way32:37way down so cancer is very preventable it's a very preventable uh disorder it'sIs Cancer Genetic?32:42just that we're doing everything we possibly can induce it in our diet lifestyle a lot of big institutions32:49believe that cancer is a genetic problem32:54um you believe otherwise the evidence is striking I mean to believe it's not33:00whether you believe it's what the data tell us okay so according to the somatic mutation theory of cancers mutations in33:07the nucleus lead to disregulated cell growth that's the sematic mutation theory in the mitochondrial metabolic33:13Theory it's a transition from oxidative phosphorilation to to a fermentation metabolism inside inside the cell um the33:22mutations are largely irrelevant what do you mean by that when the mitochondria become defective they throw out33:29Ros reactive oxygen species that are carcinogenic and mutogenic W what does33:36that mean causing mutations so a lot of the mutations that we see in the nucleus of the tumor cell that is the subject of33:42the sematic mutation Theory are Downstream effects of the dysfunction of the mitochondria so the mitochondria is33:49causing a downstream effect which are mutations which according to the sematic mutation Theory are the cause of the33:54disregulated cell growth let me tell you why that's absolutely untrue there's some cancer cells growing34:00out of control have no mutations and normally not discuss how can that be that's a a challenge to the theory if34:07the theory says that all cancers have mutations and you have some cancers that have no mutations and they're growing out of control that should say who bell34:14ring one uh then they the the sematic mutation uh people people who think this34:20said oh okay we have we have a problem here not all mutations are the ones that cause the disregulated only some and we34:27have a name for those some that's called driver mut okay now it's a nice term because some of those mutations are34:32called passengers they don't really do anything but the drivers are the ones that lead to the disregulated cell34:37growth so we should be focusing our attention on these driver mutations new evidence from the recent scientific34:43literature can you believe this they're taking tissue normal tissues from patients different organs and things34:49like this from not patients from normal people no cancer perfectly like yourself here we would take tissue from you and34:55say oh my Christ look at the you got driver mutation in your esophagus and your different parts of your body you35:00got driver but you don't have a tumor what's going on with that how you explain that these driver mutations are35:05causing disregulated cell growth when we have thousands of driver mutations that are there that are not causing35:11disregulated cell growth oh okay that's a another problem the biggest devastating information against the35:18somatic mutation theory is if you take the nucleus from a tumor cell cleanly take it out of the tumor cell and you35:24have another normal cell here you take the nor the nucleus out of the normal cell and you put the tumor cell into35:30that cytoplasm you get regulated growth no disregulated growth but if I have the normal cell and have a tumor cell take35:37the tumor nucleus out of there and take the normal nucleus and put it into the tumor cytoplasm which contains35:43mitochondri defective mitoch disregulated cell Dr this has been seen over and over and over again so just to35:48summarize that so if you take the tumor nucleus side of the cell and put it into a a normal healthy cell yes um35:55everything's fine everything is fine but if you take take healthy cell nucleus and put it into a tumor cell you still36:00have the same dis regulated cell growth tumor growth so which means that it's not the nucleus absolutely it's36:06something else it's something else and that's the mitochondria and I told you then you have cancer cells with no mutations and then you have driver36:12mutations and normal cells that never become cancer you put all those things together and you have to be uh a36:19hopeless ideologue to think that cancer is a genetic disease um it's a silent36:26assumption in the field that cancer is a genetic every textbook of biology cell biology and bio cancer is a geneticWhy Haven't Opinions Changed Based On Dr Seyfried's Evidence?36:31disease why hasn't people's opinions changed despite the evidence that you36:37present it's a very difficult thing it goes back to um when you have one Theory36:44replacing another theory it's called Paradigm Paradigm shifts and in all in36:49history of science Paradigm shifts have been met with great great resistance uh the clear the clearest one was the36:56Kernan Revolution when uh for eight 1,800 years astronomers in37:04our early Astron astronomers thought the Earth was immovable in the center of the solar system for 1,000 this was Claudius37:12TMI Aristotle and the Bible and all these Earth is immovable and the Sun and37:18the Moon and the planets all revolve around the earth 1,800 years even37:24Cernic's uh was working with these mathematical formulations this kep was being constantly confused until he said37:31what happens if we put the sun in the center of the solar system and consider the Earth as simply another planet that37:37would revolve oh all of a sudden things started to make sense and gardano Bruno37:44uh a theologian was put to death for suggesting that cernus was right um37:50there was a tremendous resistance on the part of the Roman Catholic Church at that time and this is the same thing37:56that happened when when and um Lewis Pastor said the germs the germs rather than bad air are the cause of disease so38:04uh and when Darwin Wallace theory of evolution came it's not special creation it's it's natural selection that that38:10can explain this these were massive Paradigm changes in the history of Science and what we're seeing today is38:17the same thing the mitochondria is the center of the problem with cancer not the nucleus the mitochondria it's a38:23mitochondrial metabolic disease and once you realize that we're going to drop these death rates massively in a very aIf We Adopt This Mindset, What Will Happen To Cancer Statistics?38:31number of years for sure so if we take two paths then if we realize that that the mitochondria is the center of the38:37dysfunction and ultimately disease in the cell yes if we go that down that path what impact do you think that will38:43have on the canc cancer statistics over the coming years it'll drop it massively38:48okay I'm not going to say we'll get rid of cancer completely uh but here's the thing we may never get rid of it but we38:54can learn to live with it and keep it at Bay if if we know how to if we know that it can't survive without these two fuels39:00and you can do a diet and lifestyle that can restrict the availability of those two fuels and keep your mitochondria as39:06healthy as you possibly can what if we don't go down that path what you think then you're going to be right one out of two people are going to be having cancer39:13that your statistics are going to be U AB absolutely correct is there anybody that you believe because you know whenAre The Current Cures Working?39:19we talk about these subjects often we think of like big Farmer and the incentives and money and follow the money and you'll figure out why people39:25don't want change are is any of that sort of conspiratorial thinking correct in your view are they I39:31don't know if that's conspiracy I don't like conspiracy terms that's absurds I like what are the facts of what we're39:38looking at but do you see a resistance from Big farmer to entertain this point of view um what do you think what do you39:45think I mean do you think this is I mean you're making a lot of not you but but people in these in that those Industries39:51the hospital industry is making enormous amounts of money they're rewarding we get uh7 billion a year for cancer39:58research in the in the in in the National Cancer Institute awarding gr many many not all many grants to look at40:05for gene mutations and all this kind of stuff um and we have drugs that are extremely expensive based on a sematic40:11mutation theory of cancer that are basically not dropping the death rate as I said we got while we're talking here40:17we're g to have 140 people dead uh from cancer uh 1,700 people years getting40:22worse and worse um with as you said we're always running for raising money for cancer research uh where's all that40:29money going what are you doing with all that money no accountability and then when you look at the scientific advisory committee of all these societies that40:36you're running for they all think published papers on cancer as a genetic disease it's too hard for the field to40:43accept at this point um it's it's too traumatic at what I'm saying it's too40:50disruptive to a a massive industry uh at this time they will come to gradually40:56adjust to what I'm saying it's just a matter of time because we cannot continue this trajectory it's immoral41:02what we're doing to some of these people I read a St that said the global incidence of early onset cancer41:07increased by roughly 80% between 1990 yeah and 2019 that's in the bmj oncology41:16um early onset of cancer is basically patients under the age of 50 and and when I think about this you know growing up in the UK whenever there's a a fun41:23run a charity race a marathon whatever it might be cancer research get the money yeah and to hear that you know41:29there's been so much money invested in cancer research over the last couple of decades but there's been an increase of41:3480% in early onset cancer in the same period for me I'm like this research doesn't appear to be41:41do being very effective well as I said you got to find what people don't do is they never ask where's the research go41:48what kind of research what what are you doing what is the research it's the theory that drives the the impetus to doThe Current Technologies Used To Prevent Cancer41:54research now a lot of great stuff has been done on you know keeping people alive that41:59suffer from cancers right because if you think about the probability of dying from a cancer I'm I'm assuming that has gone42:06down yeah uh to some extent it has you know we call there's two ways of looking it's called Uh progression free survival42:12and overall survival uh these are the terminologies that are used in the clinical world of cancer uh uh and they42:19represent the approval of drugs through the Food and Drug Administration if you have a drug that42:25improves a progression free survival uh progression free means it looks like42:30the drug is working on the tumor um because you know the tumor you can see it it gets bigger and bigger and more42:36lethal and more lethal and and if I see it not growing nearly as much uh I say42:41wow look at the it's it's slowing the what we call traditional progression okay it's called progression free42:47survival and then you have overall survival so you have two ways to approve42:53drugs mostly for cancer right how does it work on aggression free survival and42:58how does it work on overall survival well they stop looking at overall survival now somebody's going to bark43:04and say well you know bottom line is mostly progression free which means that the patients it looks like the tumor is43:09being effectively managed but they live only a couple of months longer than they would have if they didn't use this drug43:16so therefore it's approved and and and um that as opposed to overall survival43:22you know you're only living a two okay You' lived two and a half extra months the tumor looked like it was manage43:27pretty well but your overall survival is is this much but you you didn't see the tumor growing uh we're going to improve43:34that drug so a lot of the new drugs that we're giving do a really good job at progression free survival but they do a43:40horrible job in keeping people alive much longer which ultimately is what you want to do you want overall survival let43:46me give you an example avastin uh bismid this this is an immoral drug that should never be used on people it was blocked43:53because it caused colon perforations in women with breast cancer they still use it on brain cancer and when you so the44:00in the tumor you got a A tumor you can see it with PET Imaging and you can not so much pet MRI and Cat Scan you can see44:06it there and it's looking there okay uh you can see it now you give the patient a vaston and uh which is this um44:15anti-angiogenic drug it's supposed to stop the abnormal blood vessels right they think that the angiogenesis blood44:22vessels is is driving the disregulated growth it's the fermentation that's driving the just regulated growth by the44:28way so all of a sudden you give the the tumor kind of disappears it doesn't look like it whoa patient gets all excited44:35The Physician looks and says look at that look at the looks like you're doing well what it does the EV what the drug44:41does is it causes the tumors permeate your enti your entire brain just like spreading it through44:48your whole brain you don't live any longer uh but you had this progression free look at the tumor so the patient44:54gets excited because it looks like the tumor's disa appearing with this very expensive drug but what it does is it45:00almost guarantees that that patient will not survive because you spread the tumor cells through the whole brain so um this45:07is why I call it an immoral kind of a thing but chemotherapy and sort of these radiation therapies they have proven to45:13keep people alive who otherwise would have died in some cases they it can and45:19and that's another thing we have to look at we have and I I work heavily in brain tumors and G blastomas and things like45:24that when you irradiate somebody's brain uh who has one of these tumors you free up massive amounts of glucose and45:30glutamine in the micro environment and if you look at the survival when we did survival looked at survival curves for45:35gleo blast throughout the world oh it's un you can't even design experiments so consistent how fast people will die it's45:42like all the different hospitals have the same survival same survival what are you doing well we do chemo we do45:48surgical debulking uh T olomide and we give steroids which raise blood sugar and we irradiate we irradiate we45:54irradiate everybody's dead so um not everybody but you know fiveyear survival46:00is is very very low 10e survival is almost zero um but if you go if you got46:05a breast cancer or if you got this is brain cancer I'm talking about this is freeing up now yes if you have a46:11circumscribed tumor and it's not anywhere else you can come in with a radiation or surgical procedure and cure46:18essentially cure that patient but if you have any level of spread or anything like this um that that person now and46:26also if you're taking a toxic poison into your body like Red Devil docar rubison they call it Red Devil your P46:32turns red everything turns red what is that is that chemotherapy yes is a chemotherapy to kill a small group of cells um or maybe a little bit of a46:40spread but your your hair falls out your body gets brutalized uh by this and then46:46if you survive the cancer and many people do we have millions and millions of cancer survivers on this planet but46:52many many folks in that group suffer from the adverse effects of being p poisoned or irradiated or surgically46:58mutilated I mean they have to change their whole and often times the cancer comes back or they die from47:04cardiovascular disease or they die from secondary adverse effects of being brutalized uh with medieval I call it47:11medieval approaches to this are you kidding me what they're doing to cancer patients so when we do metabolic therapy47:19we we shrink the tumor down for sure then the surgeon can come in and he sees47:24it smaller fewer blood vessels because of the metab therapy and we can take out a greater amount uh of of this and then47:30we transition back to prevent this tumor from recurring metabolic therapy can be47:35used to not only prevent the cancer but can also be used to treat the cancer now let me tell you go most hospitals47:42suppose people say well you know I really want to do things to prevent cancer can I do standard of care before I have a tumor what do you mean you want47:50to go into a uh major Cancer Clinic and have toxic doxorubicin and radiation to47:55your body just in the event that you might get a cancer this is absurd but yet when you have cancer that's what they do to you right but with metabolic48:03therapy you can use it as both a prevention and a treatment it's just that with a treatment we bring in some more drugs to Target the glutamine we48:09don't do that on the prevention side on the I was just looking at some stats as you were speaking around the fiveyear48:14survival rates of a variety of different cancers um over time and it does appear48:20that survival rates of these cancers from breast cancer to prostate cancer to lung cancer to leukemias um and various48:26melanomas has improved since the 1970s so the 1970s to the 1990s to the48:332010s there's been an improvement in the survival rate um which I guess is a credit to the research that's been done48:40um what you're saying is that this the treatments we have still today are horrific yeah and the and the survivals48:46are not that much greater it's not like you're getting massively longer survivals yeah I mean and I have to I I48:52have to preface that these stats might not be right because this is AI we're dealing with here but the there's a 5%48:57for example with breast cancer between the 1990s and 2010 there's just a 5% difference in overall survival in49:04overall survival okay so your survival your overall survival is two and a half to three months greater I I don'tHow Do We Prevent Cancer?49:10actually have those stats in no but that's that's that's the the evidence the papers that we're looking at so so49:15how do we prevent prevent this then I'm 32 years old now so I want to make sure that I49:23live my life in such a way that I limit my chance of cancer one of the things I always reflect on is the fact that many49:28of the people that I know that have got cancer breast cancer or other forms of cancer appear to be remarkably healthy49:33yeah always at the beginning there there not always but many times the person comes in gee I49:39just was diagnosed with cancer I didn't know I had it I didn't feel bad I didn't and then all of a sudden you get treated and they look like death warmed over but49:45I'm saying like how can how can healthy people be getting cancer if there's this sort of central well because you I as I49:50said are the the the the and we're seeing this I'm seeing it in my own I'm getting more and more emails from young49:57people in their 30s uh late 20s 30s early 40s like with colon cancer breast cancer and all these kinds of things but50:04look at our diet and lifestyle situation today those those things that I'm talking about lack of exercise a lot of50:10stress poor sleep bad food all of this kind of stuff impacting parts of our50:15bodies so what do we do about it though know about it and then and then what do we do so I know that's personal choice50:21I'm not here to take pieces and and jelly donuts off the market for sure or breakfast here I love that stuff too but50:27the qu the question is I don't eat it every day and I know if I do it'll kill50:34me so so yeah skipping meals water only fat occasionally there's a lot of things50:41you can do to keep your mitochondria healthy okay so tell me what those things are I just exercise you look like50:46you're a pretty healthy guy yeah I go to I go to the gym you don't look morbidly obese to me not not yet not yet well50:51that's important because you don't ever want it yet we would't be in America too long so my chan well and listen it's not50:56just the United States we were kind of like the first ones to plow that field but it's starting to spread everywhere I think in China they have the most 20051:03million obese people in China now so should I be on a keto diet then here's what we did okay uh we developed theShould I Be On A Keto Diet?51:10glucose Ketone index calculator at Boston College all right my students and I because we were trying to uh work with51:17cancer patients blood sugar and ketones um independently of each other we had a51:23ketone meter and we had a blood glucose meter so we were monitoring ketones by itself and glucose by itself and we51:30worked with a very nice woman U from American who lived in East France who since passed away from a brain stem51:37tumor was very very difficult we kept her alive very long but eventually we didn't know what we need what we know51:42now but she got into an argument for a handicapped parking spot with her neighbor upstairs and her blood sug and51:50blood sugar went through the roof she ran upstairs and she took her blood blood sugar and she says oh my God the tumor is going to grow I said what's51:55your ketones and she says oh it's still 2 and a half Miller well that's still pretty high usually it's very very low52:01it's very high so my students and I we said you know this is too traumatic to try to measure these two independently52:08why don't we make a singular number divide the glucose in molar in the blood by the Ketone and Molar in the blood now52:15you get this number that's much more stable and it allows the cancer patient to know that if I keep this Zone in 2.052:22and below my tumor cells aren't going to be able to grow very fast I did this for the brain cancer right now it's being52:28used for all Cancers and now it's being used for guys like yourself who just want to stay healthy and because what it52:35is essentially is a quantitative determination if you're in the Paleolithic zone or not oh so if I'm at52:402.0 like my friend Dominic the austino he's always down in these zones he's living the P he's a Paleolithic man52:47living in modern society what's a Paleolithic man that's how our ancestors were during the Paleolithic period okay52:53so he's got the right balance of glucose and ketones in his blood like we did when we were hunting mammoths and and52:58Buffalos and these kinds of things when we were hunter gatherers in the thousands of years of our existence as a53:05species tens of thousands of years he is in that zone is he in keto yeah well53:10that's that's what the low gki is that means you're at a level of Keto now yes53:15he doesn't eat a lot of carbohydrates in his diets eats leafy vegetables and a lot of meat and and this kind of thing53:21sparingly on fruits uh like grapefruits we learned from the epilepsy field great fruits provide a tremendous amount of53:28vitamin C with don't and do not Spike glucose that's that's very interesting so you can have uh certain fruits that53:34can keep you in this metabolic zone of P I call it the Paleolithic Zone which is the way we evolve with there was no53:40cancer in our in our existence when people hear that they might start jumping on the paleo diet I don't even know what the not a paleo diet it's it's53:47diets that are low in carbohydrates okay okay um Mediterranean diets like people53:52say to me at told God what should I eat should I eat this and that normally you would eat foods that have very low low53:57glycemic index which means the speed with which glucose is released like a banana very high in glycemic index you54:04eat a banana your blood sugar immediately spikes many fruits are like that um but you want you want foods that54:11keep a low steady uh uh gki now I built that uh calculator for brain cancer54:19patients initially then we realize it's powerful for all cancers uh we put the cancer patient in the low glucose Ketone54:25index we get them down in there then we come in with the glutamine targeting drugs to to kind of polish off these54:31tumors or put them in even a more dormant state but now we finding all these young kid like yourself all these54:3630 20 year olds what's your gki I mean they're out to weightlifting and they're looking at their G they don't have54:42cancer they're just excited to see they they can get into this Paleolithic Zone by themselves and that yes that will54:48prevent cancer because you can't get cancer if your mitochondria healthy if if you're in a Paleolithic Zone where our ancestors rarely have ever got54:54cancer then you're you're back in this oh you me to tell me I can't eat this and I can't eat that what does it do toDr Seyfried's Dog Study54:59your gki oh Mak it go up well don't eat that so you did a study on dogs a dog55:05with a tumor yes can you tell me about that study it was a woman came to me and this is what I say does you don't have55:12to have a a PhD in Biochemistry to understand what some of the things this55:18woman had no degree whatsoever she just heard the uh about what we did to these mice and she did the same thing to her55:25dog um it was a pitbull and at aged seven years old it had big mast cell55:30tumor on its lip so she listened to my YouTube video over and over she said to me I just kept listening then he says I55:37I got I I I I got some raw chicken she says dogs wolves evolved to eat chickens55:43so she got some uh chicken Cho chopped up the chicken she cut the calories of she found some dog food calculator to55:50how much calories the dog was getting she cut the calories the dog look lost only 5% of its body weight55:56she got uh pollic fish oil raw eggs and cut all the calories everything was all56:03natural for this dog um and all of a sudden we have the pictures you can see them in the P if you saw the picture big56:09big tumor on its lip that the the veterinarians said this dog is gonna to survive you have to give him chemo and56:15radiation and surgery and all this kind of stuff and it's going to cost a lot of money the dog's gonna have diarrhea it's going to be you know she didn't want any56:21part of that so she said well let's just try this metabolic thing and and she56:27kept all the records and the pictures and what she did and how much she gave the dog and all this so I was able to get all that information from her um put56:35my friend Lauren Lauren Nations who was a veterinarian uh on the paper because I said what biology guy at Boston College56:42is telling you how to manage cancer in a dog we got to have some veterinarian on here to validate to make sure he's there56:47and he looked at the pictures and we looked at all the thing and disappeared so what happened was the dog eventually56:53died of heart disease at 15 and a 12 years years of age so essentially that's the only when people say well metabolic57:01therapy cure cancer I I say metabolic therapy is never considered a cure for57:06cancer it's an effective non-toxic management for cancer but in the case of that dog it appeared to work to cure the57:12dog but that's the only one I'll say oh he's gonna say cure cannot that dog happened to get he died from old ageHuman Cases Of People That Have Followed Your Research57:17from a heart heart attack and we did it with a brain tumor guy Pablo Kelly who just passed away unfortunately from a57:23from a surgical um his his uh had a a major cerebral uh Hemorrhage after his57:29surgery from Devon England you know Devon England that's where I'm from are you from Devon yeah oh wow well Pablo57:35was there he just passed away fortunately we've talking to him the day before he passed away Pablo Pablo Kelly57:41so he was from Devon England had a gleo blastoma which is the worst of the worst uh they said and he's all over your your57:48newspapers there and Devon he was always sending me articles from England um man57:53rejects standard of care so he he had this gleo blastoma and they took the57:58tissue out which is brain cancer yeah brain the worst of the brain cancers you know uh they took the tumor out and they58:04said oh you it's in inoperable inoperable and uh but if you do58:10radiation in chemo uh we you might live nine maybe 12 months at the most well58:15Pablo came from a family of like we don't dabble and and this kind of medicine we're more holistic kind of58:22people so he emailed me this was in 2014 um and said I want to try this metabolic58:29thing so he rejected uh chemo and radiation and they said it wasn't58:35surgically capable of being completely removed anyway so he did this I I gave58:41him the information that I give to everybody and this was way back before we knew a lot of what we now know and uh58:48I said this poor guy he sees another one and they said you're going to be dead they they brow beat him they try to force him to put the radiation mask on58:55they hacked his beard off uh all this kind of stuff and he just jumped up he said I can't do this stuff so um he59:01didn't take any steroids he didn't take any any radiation he didn't take any chemo he just did the metabolic therapy59:07and he's on English telev or things with all of his paleo diet which actually a low very low carbohydrate diet he had59:13the avocados there he had the fish oil there he had this different stuff two three years go by he emails me59:20I said gez Pablo I thought you would have been dead you're still alive what's going on with that59:27so so he calls me up and he says you know um I went in for a CAT scan the59:32other day doctors are like still surprised that he's alive and they said this tumor is is still there and it's59:38growing and they think they can cut it out now so he was three years on on just59:43metabolic approach he didn't take any glutamine Inhibitors which was really remarkable so so anyway he asked me and59:50I have I have physician friends that a radiologist that can look at it and we measured it when it was first first59:57diagnosed in 2014 and then we saw it did become a little bigger so and the now1:00:02the surgeon said I think I can get it looks more more receptable here it was inoperable now it becomes receptable so1:00:08he took it out and um Pablo recovered really well and uh the surgeon says I1:00:14think I got it all wow so so and and Pablo is measuring his glucose Ketone1:00:19index with our Keo monitor so I had every day sometimes two and three five years of data on Pablo can you believe1:00:26this so so anyway Pablo thinks he's cured because the the surgeon all of a1:00:33sudden he goes back to his kind of weak weak ways and you can see the his gki1:00:38goes up and all of a sudden the tumor starts to show up again puts the fear of God back into him goes back on a more1:00:44restrict condition another three years goes by and this time the tumor is growing slowly very slow don't forget1:00:51gleo blastomas kill you very quickly um with standard of care you can barely get out of at his age if you can get two1:00:57years you're doing you're doing really good so anyway now he's three and he's got six years out and he says you know1:01:04um uh it's still back you know he I got to go in so it first so this is second debul first debul goes off gets back on1:01:12another second debulking another three years goes by he has a third debulking can you believe this the debulking1:01:17debulking is the cutting the tumor out it's the removal surgical removal of this tumor but he's never had radiation1:01:23or chemo or any of the kinds of stamp what we call standards of care so for1:01:28and now um he he has uh I talked to him a couple of weeks ago and uh he was1:01:35doing he was doing really really good he had the the third removal and we were laughing with myself and Dr duer and my1:01:42associates he says yeah can you imagine um uh I've had now three operations on a1:01:49previously inoperable tumor so we were saying wow they got1:01:55that wrong didn't they follow and they kept wanting to irradiate him and do all this stuff and he said no no going to keep doing this and so we were speaking1:02:03to him and and uh he's out 10 years the tumor was was diagnosed in in in August1:02:102014 and he passed away August uh 2024 from they try to go in and get the1:02:17last bit of tumor out of his brain he came out of we got him uh we talked to him a thumbs up smiling talking like1:02:23crazy six hours later cereal hemr and need dies so uh he didn't die from the cancer he died from the a surgical1:02:31problem with the surgery so he was a you talk about long-term survivors uh you1:02:36rarely survive two years with a gleo blastoma the fact that he was out 10 years and if he hadn't had that last bit1:02:42of surgery the guy would have still been alive because he was talking like you and I are talking this is a guy who has a a terminal so I said to Pablo I said1:02:50you could outlive me I I says I said we're all terminal to some extent right we're never all of us aren't going to1:02:55live to I said sure he was a young guy he was only 20 22 or 23 when he was diagnosed he was in his 30s now when he1:03:01passed away 10 years so he's 33 34 years old and and I said you know I could be1:03:07dead before you and we were laughing and we had a good time and then next thing I know I got an email from his wife he1:03:12said Pablo is is on on on on brain dead and something I said what1:03:17the hell happened what happened to this poor guy and it wasn't the cancer so um1:03:23who how know I don't know what how long you would have lived how many more things but what I'm saying oh he's an1:03:29anecdote well listen if I had a drug that did what what metabolic therapy did and I could get more people like Pablo1:03:35are you kidding me they'd be run running all over the world and when you say metabolic therapy you mean theWhat Is Metabolic Therapy?1:03:40combination of the calorie restrictive yeah ketogenic approach yes avoiding well first of all you're avoiding you're1:03:47avoiding things that are going to kill you the radiation is going to kill you for the for many people not all people1:03:52okay everybody say well well listen you can you can look at go have people look at the data themselves for crying out loud and you can see how long you're1:03:58going to live he didn't do what they what they grab everybody in what did he do specifically he didn't take radiation1:04:03or chemo yeah and he brought his glucose Ketone index down to the 2.0 Zone and1:04:08kept it kept it low and he took some supplements and a few things here and there but he wasn't really targeting the1:04:15glutamine like we thought it with like we we thought we we found now certain parasite medications will be effective1:04:20in targeting glutamine so we're doing all non-toxic strategies to manage cancer you don't have to be brutalized1:04:26by the system if you know what to do and how to do it the problem the problem is most of the poor oncologists never heard1:04:32of what I'm talking the stuff I'm telling you right now they never heard of it the risk is someone gets cancer that's listening to this or someone hasWhat Should Someone That Has Cancer And Is Listening To This Do?1:04:37cancer that that's listening to this I mean statistically there's a lot of people listening to this that have cancer right now and they're speaking to1:04:43their doctor and their doctor is saying chemotherapy radiation therapy etc etc gluc glucose has nothing to do with1:04:50tumor eat whatever you want yeah and so what' you say to those people who are they've just got a DI agnosis um and1:04:57their doctors are saying right listen this is pretty bad severe we're going to suggest that you take chemotherapy yeah1:05:03you're not telling them not to take chemotherapy are you I'm not telling them that and what we found what we found is that when you are in uh1:05:10nutritional ketosis with a glucose keto index of 2.0 or below my colleagues that1:05:15we work with in Istanbul Turkey were able to show that chemotherapies at much lower dosages can be even more1:05:22therapeutically powerful when you're in nutritional ketosis so you don't have to get rid of a lot of these different1:05:27procedures that we have today I'm just saying radiation for brain cancer I'm not saying radiation for lung or some of1:05:33the other cancers okay because if you can if you can shrink those tumors down and make them very weak and vulnerable a1:05:39surgical procedure a radiation procedure even lowd dose chemo could come in and even immunotherapy if you if you took a1:05:46big tumor and shrunk it down to a small small nub and it's resistant to a lot of the things they all have to share1:05:53something in common for them to survive have this this path that might be an immunotherapy could come in because1:05:59they're going to Target whatever all of them have together and you could possibly get rid of it that way I'm thinking of a friend of mine that um has1:06:06been diagnosed with brain cancer brain tumor and this is one of the most you1:06:11know it's a it's a woman in her 40s or 50s trying to keep her Anonymous as possible um who is just the most fit1:06:20athletic person that I I know eats amazingly well is literally known for1:06:26exercise um and I'd go how how is it possible that someone who I would probably say is fitter than I am if you1:06:31looked at their sort of metabolic Health has got a severe brain tumor well it it1:06:37they can stay healthy for uh and I'm not saying everybody who has and it depends1:06:42on what kind of a tumor it is as well is it a gly blastoma alod dendral Goma you know Panet there's a lot of different1:06:49kinds of tumors that want to know that it's it's not growing necessarily but it's big and it's in the brain and1:06:54they're going to remove for surgical operation well if they can what we always suggest for the brain cancer if you do metabolic therapy up1:07:01front and I've had uh surgeons tell me this uh you can shrink it down because1:07:07one of the um one it's angry it's an angry thing right and you can see some1:07:12slight Invasion if you can shrink that down so that it's more circumscribed now the surgeon can look at and go oh my God1:07:18we we know uh many many scientific Publications the more you can debolt that's called the removal of the tumor1:07:25debulking the longer the patient will survive the evidence is massive to support that but you know with a lot of1:07:31these brain tumors you don't get it all and there's always some little piece that remains and when you irradiate you1:07:36explode the ability to the cells to ferment energy and it's very hard to kill them but but if you can get the1:07:43majority of it out and then transition the patient back into a metabolic State keeping the pressure on those tumor1:07:49cells you can remain healthy like Pablo I mean these these guys can and when you found in mice is that when ketogenicKeto Plus Hyperbaric Oxygen Study1:07:54diet was combined with a hyperbaric oxygen therapy the average survival time was increased by roughly 80% yeah even1:08:01more sometimes now but what okay so why do we hyper do hyperbaric oxygen right1:08:07that's the question what's going on with hyperbaric oxygen why is this like a good thing it works best when the1:08:13patient and the mouse is in nutritional ketosis okay so look we have a tumor we1:08:20iriate that tumor how does the radiation kill the tumor cells it hits oxygen blows up and it causes a reactive R and1:08:28it's like a a stepping on a landmine it blows the tumor up right so um cancer1:08:35cells protect themselves even though they make a lot of rust they all they're this close to death anyway but they have1:08:41a very powerful antioxidant system and interestingly enough that besides1:08:47causing the disregulated growth the glucose and the glutamine also protect1:08:52them to some extent from the Ross that they're making and can you believe this the Ross r r reactive oxygen species1:09:01that are carcinogenic and mutogenic so they're they destroy our our our proteins lipids and and nucleic acids1:09:09they're disruptive molecules so radiation will cause a Ross in the micro environment Ros that'll blow up and kill1:09:16cells normal and and tumor cells but but if you want to selectively kill tumor cells you with Ross Not to cause your1:09:24hair to fall out your gums to bleed and all this crazy stuff you take the patient you put him in nutritional1:09:30ketosis and you say he's l a low gki then you go into hyperbaric oxygen which1:09:35dissolves oxygen directly into your blood now it's better than just breathing 100% oxygen because you can1:09:40actually dissolve oxygen in the bloodstream then you're taking away the two fuels that protect the tumor and1:09:47you're giving it internal Ross which kills the tumor internally only to the tumor cell not to your surrounding1:09:53tissues so you're killing selectively killing tumor cells without collateral damage to your to the rest of your body1:09:59as a matter of fact the rest of your cells are getting super healthy because they're burning ketones in pure oxygen1:10:04unbelievable how do we measure if our um can you believe this I can't even believe I'm saying this stuff1:10:10myself you really got to know the biochemistry and you have to know the physiology of your own body and you have1:10:15to understand evolutionary biology most people just aren't that intelligent including me it's not1:10:21intelligence most people most people kind of want things sort of simple principles that they can1:10:27live by and Implement and also quick and easy yeah of course okay they don't want to do what I'm talking about it because1:10:33it might be or the other thing let me tell you one thing and remember it if you do metabolic therapy success rides1:10:39heavily on your shoulders you're not sitting there like some Pawn with mannequin some guy's poison and radiating you to to make metabolic1:10:46therapy work you are the one doing the gki you're the one in your it's your1:10:51soul it's your you're responsible for your existence on this planet you're G to put your your precious soul in the1:10:57hands of someone who has less of a knowledge about the the problem than than you might as an entrepreneur I'm1:11:04always looking for ways to connect and to create and that's why I

you be predisposed genetically to cancer yeah that's what those germine mutations but you can manage that peopleCan You Have A Pre-Disposition To Cancer?1:12:03think you know my my grandmother had breast cancer my mother had breast cancer so yeah you know they live in a common environment too it's not like1:12:09you're like in order to prove that you you you and all the siblings would have to be raised in a different environment1:12:15different countries different Lifestyles and then see if you all got cancer at the same time under all these different conditions that's definitely genetic1:12:21that's like Huntington's disease tayac disease or these kinds of things they'll manifest regardless of the environment1:12:27so you saying to me that I should as a 32y old man that's cancer-free um God willing I think God touchwood um IShould I Restrict What I Eat, To Stave Off Cancer?1:12:34should calorie restrict myself to keep my mitochondria healthy and my1:12:40metabolism healthy now I should be in a in a sort of restri I say it's good to1:12:46visit the state our Paleolithic ancestors had no choice there wasn't a1:12:51doughnut shop on every corner there wasn't pizzas there were there weren't the kinds of Highly processed carbohydrate Foods available to them so1:12:58should I be fasting should I be doing keto I you know I don't want to tell you what you should or should not do I'm not a physician here I'm a scientist I study1:13:06what causes these things and I study how to manage them you have to read what I'm saying and you have to come to your own1:13:12decisions about how you want to conduct your life I've given you information what's your view on fasting fasting is aWhat's Your View On Fasting?1:13:19powerful uh way to get your body into nutritional ketosis but it ain't easy try doing it try you try doing it see1:13:26how how easy it it ain't easy right uh but that's why we developed this procedure where if you go um rather than1:13:33going cold turkey uh say well today I'm gonna have a big I'm G eat as much as I can and then tomorrow okay you can go1:13:39the I can it's the second third days when you start to really know what the hell is going on believe me I've tried1:13:44it it's It Ain't Easy that's why we developed uh a zero carb diet for 14 days 10 to 14 days just zero eat meat1:13:52fish chicken whatever you want but just don't eat any bread pasta this kind of thing on keto um how do we get into thatHow Do I Get Into The Keto State?1:14:00sort of ketosis state that people often talk about measure your glucose Ketone index how do do that with the the the1:14:06keto Mojo meter you can buy it from Amazon okay okay you can buy now don't forget they get a free Libra meter now1:14:12for the blood they're working on Ketone blood meters but it's not there yet right now the keto Mojo or some other1:14:18keto meters where you could take a prick your finger like a diabetic you take a glucose strip and you put it on the1:14:23blood and you put it into the machine it tells you what your glucose is squeeze your finger a little bit more take the Ketone strip touch it to the blood put1:14:30it in the meter it gives you the Ketone value push the button gki comes right up okay okay very simple everybody can buy1:14:38it from from Amazon get the meter buy the consumables uh and then they can test it this is what Pablo this is what1:14:44all the the cancer patients the ones who really want to get into metabolic ketosis I think I've tried keto before1:14:49and I say think because I didn't measure my my keto level I was assuming I did yeah no it's really people say well I1:14:55haven't eaten you know I'm in ketos how do you know well I blew into this thing and the bulb came out I peed on a strip it looked like it was ketosis they are1:15:02indirect measures the most accurate is the blood measure so um it's hard to stay in that state for most people right1:15:09this is one of the things because the Temptations in our society are so strong yeah I mean Paleolithic man had no1:15:16choice do you think he that was his State that's all he knew for thousands and thousands tens of thousand hundreds1:15:21of thousands of years that's all he knew he didn't say let me go down to get a big jelly fil donnut down at the at the1:15:28end of the the river there no there's none of that he had to live in that state now we have so many Temptations1:15:34all the things that we are biologically clear for when you see obesity that's1:15:39evolution in action they are the descendants of our long ancestors that1:15:44could hold on to energy so efficiently we were an energy starved species for1:15:50the majority of our existence on the planet so anything we ate would be very little we never pee out glucose glucose1:15:56is converted to fat and we store energy as fat so those guys are energy efficient human beings now all of a1:16:04sudden we find oursel with everything and that's Evolution and action man that we're just we're just you're allowing to1:16:11see the how we can store energy so efficiently because our ancestors liveed1:16:17through such um environmental forcing we had famines we had long TRS1:16:23we our body could store energy so efficiently because it wasn't we had to store what little we could get from the1:16:29environment now you've got you know 300 million Americans in this food environment where when when they walk out their front door they see the Dunkin1:16:35Donut they can lie in bed and order a Dunkin Donut to their front during 10 minutes you don't even have to unas the1:16:40car they hand it through the window yeah no energy no energy expenditure energy in so so you know giving them this1:16:47information might be fairly futile because the tempt well that's I'm not here to tell people again I'm not here1:16:53to tell people what they should or should not do I'm just here to explain like why do we have all this not mystery1:16:59it's all biological evolution you understand biological evolution almost everything that I'm talking about makes1:17:04perfect sense um and unfortunately that's not part of our scientific literacy anymore so we need whatDo We Need More Discipline?1:17:10discipline discipline is important um discipline is important um you know1:17:16every major religion had had a point of fasting um to be whether you're Islamic1:17:25Judaism or whatever Catholicism Hinduism whatever I don't whatever they always1:17:31had some sort of fasting why why you do fasting because you want to purify your body you want to become closer to God1:17:36you want to you want to you want to feel in control uh and that's always part and1:17:41if you do it with prayer it's even better so uh there was a reason for doing all that and uh people realized1:17:48the Ancients uh knew this kind of thing but uh we don't do that anymore uh we1:17:53don't go 40 days without food like Jesus did in the deserts um but a human being1:17:59you could absolutely do that I I know because I can look at your weight I can look at your size and I can pretty much1:18:04tell you how long you can go with before you died and how do I know that because George Cahill a good friend late George1:18:11kale ran the D jlin diabetes center and he he he evaluated people that would1:18:16just could water only fasting on until until death and um and some of those1:18:22conon MA prison and things so he was able to know how much you could how long1:18:29you could go now what about um Angus barbar went 377 days uh without foodWhat Happens When You Fast?1:18:36George Cahill would fast some of these obese people for for 250 300 days what1:18:41happens inside their body with with they're burning fat so what happens is you burn fat okay liver stores a lot of1:18:47of um bone store the minerals that you can get minerals from your bones you can get a lot of fat storage um vitamins are1:18:55stored in fat a lot of vitamin D outside of the weight loss what's going on in you know we said PE religious people1:19:01used to fast to get closer to God yeah which seems to me to point to some sort of cognitive change yes and that's from1:19:07burning ketones yeah burn when you burn K I said in the brain when your brain starts shifting to ketones your energy1:19:13uh the bang for the buck for each calorie that comes in from a ketone body increases the efficiency of oxidative1:19:19phosphorilation so you more focused massively and you know this is1:19:25why our ancestors with the way that if you're if you are dependent on killing1:19:30some animal uh for your survival and you are out on the hunt you are focused uh1:19:37because if you're not focused you're going to starve to death so every organ sense organ in our body is super is1:19:44super jacked when you're in these ketotic states so and these guys walking around with headphones listen you know1:19:51all this I mean this is like depriving ourselves of the natural ways uh of our ancestry don't forget we're not just you1:19:58and I are not just here over the last you know 100 300 400 years we are the descendants of members that are same as1:20:05us you know hundreds of thousands of years ago they were they just didn't have the technology that we have today1:20:11but if you could brought a Paleolithic man from say 500,000 years ago and you gave him a bunch of donuts and told a he1:20:18would die went to heaven you mean to tell me I don't have to go out and kill the elk anymore they're going to hand me the food right through the window of1:20:23course he's going to do that you go in the cave and you throw a bunch of jelly fil Donuts into a bunch of1:20:29Caven who been chewing on the half eaten rat or something you think they're not1:20:34going to eat those jelly donuts they have a some chimpanzees live with a family down in Florida I know some1:20:41YouTube thing The Chimps they're eating the food with the family and then they give jelly sandwiches to The Chimps1:20:47banging on the table you think they were going to go crazy chimpanzees loving the jelly sandwiches do you have kidsWhat Advice Would Dr Seyfried Give To His Kids?1:20:53yes what advice would you give to your children if they're listening to this now about um how to prevent their chance1:21:00of getting sick from cancer or these other well they probably say well Dad how come you don't do a lot of the things first of all I'm not telling I1:21:05told you I don't tell anybody what to do or or how they do it I'm just telling you the science behind why why things1:21:12work um yeah my my my my my children my two sons and my um they're all very very1:21:19successful and uh they they said if we ever got cancer we would be doing your we would be doing metabolic therapy if1:21:25we were to ever get cancer and I said just keep you know exercise and and do what you can do the best you can in our1:21:31environment I mean don't get me wrong I'm eat I'm eating a jelly donut I'm drinking beer I'm drinking whiskey why1:21:38because I like it but I'm not going to be doing it all the time you know it's just it's just I'm not going to be1:21:43saying oh I'm going to eat pizza sure but I'm not going to be uh uh not doing it I do water I do intermittent fasting1:21:50I don't eat for 18 20 hours at a time I do a lot of exercise over at the university the gym and the facilities1:21:57that we have um but I but I understand and then if I were to get cancer I would1:22:02have to um bite the bullet and do what I'm do what I know works as much as it wouldn't be pleasurable but it would be1:22:08certainly a better alternative than being radiated and poisoned I'm telling you that if that has built yourWhy Isn't Dr Seyfried Trying To Be Metabolically Perfect?1:22:14conviction to the point that you're so convinced that the real issue is this sort of metabolic dysfunction1:22:20um why aren't you optimizing your life to be sort of metabolically perfect well because I live in the same Society you1:22:26do yeah okay and and fortunately yes our technology has improved uh1:22:33significantly um you know I'm not a monk I'm not going to be in some Monastery you know chanting something um I I I am1:22:41a member of the society just as you are and I enjoy the things that we have to offer us to make our lives a little bit1:22:48more pleasurable there's nothing like sitting down over a nice meal and having a discussion with some wine and enjoying1:22:53it and en jooy the moment but don't but not to be locked into that kind of uh1:22:59diet and lifestyle all the time uh puts you at risk there's an election going onWhat Food Laws Would Dr Seyfried Introduce?1:23:05in the United States at the moment Trump versus Camala Harris um if you won the1:23:10election and you became president of the United States and you had to introduce some regulations or some laws around1:23:16food and all of these kinds of things what would you do well I I think you1:23:21know you're were talking about a food industry you're talking about a multi-dimensional economy I I would not1:23:29again you don't want government to tell you what you should do you should make1:23:35the choices but you have to recognize are there are there choices and what are these choices right now we're not in and1:23:41we're not seeing or understanding uh how things harm people if if we have an1:23:47obesity epidemic and that would put you at risk for all these horrific chronic diseases why do they not know that we we1:23:55introduced some regulation in the UK regarding smoking so you can't smoke inside anymore well that's but do you see this your secondhand smoke can1:24:02impact negatively the person sitting next to you this uh uh obese person's1:24:07personal choice to be obese is not going to make you obese or sick so this is a different kind of a situation um it that1:24:15has to come from internal to the person and they have to be concerned with their own health what about drugs though like1:24:20cocaine is not legal so why can't they intervene to say you can't have Dunkin Donuts um because they're both you know1:24:29gonna harm the indivual I think you'd get a revolution if you can't eat a Dunkin Donut you were not going to get a revolution if you can't have1:24:35C you try take go down here in Brooklyn and take away all these Donuts from people you know you're going to see1:24:42they're going to go you know it's it's like it's personal choices I I I I like1:24:47Dunkin Donut I mean I like the coffee especially but um but you can go to donnut shop and get some of these1:24:53crawlers and jelly fills and Honey Dipped are you kidding me these things are delicious you ever get these blueberry muffins you tremble while you1:24:59eat some of this stuff you know it's and I'm not going to take that away from me but if I want one I'm not going to be oh every day I got to eat no I just don't1:25:06eat it I on the weekend I might get one and even sometimes two or three weeks months go by before I'll get one you1:25:12know but uh but when you get it man you enjoy it you really love it are youIs Dr Seyfried Hopeful?1:25:18hopeful I am very hopeful because PE when the science comes you can't1:25:23suppress the truth it's going to come out the evidence the scientific evidence is there I'm documenting this scientific1:25:30and it's based on the shoulders of OT warberg are you kidding me I mean this was a giant in the field of biochemistry1:25:35it's not like I made this stuff up I'm just extending what he has done to a new dimension and putting it into a1:25:41practical application which he had never done so it's just an extension of of of1:25:46the knowledge base o over this time why' you care so much why do I care so much1:25:52you know I'm not in it for the you know what I'm in it for I want to see the the scientific1:25:59principles substantiated if you know that you can keep these people alive at a higher1:26:05quality of life based on the knowledge of the science that's doing that that's gratification man it's gratification to1:26:13know that these if because because you arise on understanding the mechanism of the problem and if you say you know if1:26:20we do it the way we're writing a big treatment protocol as we speak it's review a really comprehensive treatment1:26:26protocol and we Institute that in the clinic and for G blastoma patients and these Advanced cancers they're not1:26:32they're not living a few extra months they're living several years longer why because you knew the science what's1:26:39wrong with that that's that's gratification you don't have to make a billion dollars on that all you have to1:26:45know is that all those folks are living longer because you understood the science that was put into practical application what's WR that's our our1:26:53research is supported by philanthropy and private foundations that money allows me to to to do these experiments1:26:59to test what I'm testing on pre-clinical models and then we translate it back into the clinic directly and we see like1:27:06Pablo Kelly he should have been done he should have been done years and years ago he lived all those years extra he's1:27:12had a wife and he's got kids he didn't have to have his sperm Frozen he didn't have to have any of that stuff done1:27:18what's wrong with that keep I'm seeing people that are should have been dead a long time ago and they're still alive1:27:23and they're saying I'm doing fine I get calls from people geez I thought that guy would have been a goner he's still1:27:28alive he's doing well I said that that keeps me going because it tells me that we're on the right path this is a1:27:35solvable problem this cancer this cancer can be dropped significantly you can1:27:41take away the fear people now put the put it on their shoulders I know what to do how to do it I'm going to follow this1:27:46will it work for everybody no well it will help a lot of people much more than what we have today but it's Paradigm1:27:52change massive paradigm change so uh they will come to know it's just a1:27:58matter of time I don't know how long it's going to take but I ain't going anywhere I'm continuing to do this I'm going to get better and better results1:28:04and we're going to keep pushing I published these case reports in the scientific literature let the scientific field uh make their decision on the1:28:11results from these papers and if you are to succeed what happens people improveAnd What If You Are Successful?1:28:17um what I'm not going to live forever so but I know that what I've done with with1:28:23following Auto warberg and cleaning up the misconceptions and misunderstanding of why he he was stalled when the field1:28:29ran off chasing jeans we got to bring bring it back on track it's a metabolic problem with metabolic U Solutions so1:28:37that will help a lot of people but it's also going to change a lot of way people are thinking about this but I I can tell1:28:43you they want to open clinics I get calls from from Asia Africa South America they want to open clinics people1:28:50are being brutalized by a system that's not working don't forget besides the terrible Financial tox the personal1:28:57physical toxicity people have gone bankrupt their marriages are falling apart because they can't pay for the1:29:03expensive drugs on these cancer things and they die and the bills are passed on to their level this is immoral stuff isAre There Any Studies That Have Broken Dr Seyfried's Heart?1:29:10there a particular case study that's broken your heart more than any others Trudy Dupont who originally let me we we1:29:18built a glucose Ketone index calculator on her Pablo is I'm still we're still1:29:24ated by Pablo's loss because Pablo was a a guy that I've known for 10 years1:29:29worked him through and then all of a sudden he gets a cerebral hem and dies he was our poster child for how long you could live with a gleo blastoma on1:29:36metabolic therapy but he didn't die from the cancer um yeah have there's some others that we wished they could have1:29:43lived a little bit longer uh with the appropriate help what I find is that sometimes within the family there's a1:29:49lot of the guy he's I really want to do what you're doing but my wife and kids saying I'm foolish to do that so it's1:29:56it's still a very we're in a very early stage of this we haven't really worked1:30:01it out into a an effective standard yet it will come so people and the other1:30:07members of the family get super help when they all work together and they do it everybody says I never felt so1:30:12healthy in my life um gu tanom had Advanced prostate cancer he wrote a book and he's on the web and he had1:30:19hypertension high blood pressure overweight more obesity and all everything and then he does uh 181:30:25several 18-day water only fasts got himself everything all these things went away his diabetes went away his1:30:31hypertension high blood pressure and the cancer can't be found so is he cured I have no idea but but he's managed yes1:30:38he's managed and he's healthier so what's wrong with that isn't that isn't that ultimately what medicine wants to1:30:44do keep people alive longer and a healthier quality of life yeah how many more do we need they say oh that's aWhat Would Dr Seyfried Say To Someone Listening?1:30:51fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke that's a fluke how many damn flukes do you want if there's someone listening now and I'm sure1:30:57there's going to be many thousands and tens of thousands of people listening um that are currently battling cancer have early1:31:05stage diagnosis I know I feel bad about this because people say oh I want to do medicab bolic therapy where can I go and1:31:11they go to their local hospital and get slapped down there's no evidence there's everything that's should come out of my mouth has never been taught to me in1:31:17medical school so what do you say to those people you know I say I I say the1:31:24I I'm sorry that the medical establishment has not come to recognize what I'm saying and then I tell them WR1:31:31your c i i you know it's it's the change has to be coming from the people ain't going to come from the top medical1:31:37schools they they are doing what they're doing very the status quo is very1:31:42profitable the status quo is very effective for these people but it's not helping the cancer patient uh as well as1:31:48it can and don't forget we're not throwing out all this stuff we're just asking people to know how to use the tools we have in a better way we don't1:31:55have to throw out immunotherapies radiation we don't have to throw out toxic poisons we just have to know1:32:00better how to use it when the patient is in this new state and the data will prove it but who's going to do that1:32:07who's going to do that the doctor says I'd love to do this if I but I'm going to lose my license if I do it what1:32:12what's going on with that they wrote the standard of care as if it were in granted can't be changed no it should be1:32:18flexible when new eviden

## Boston College Hospital Philosophy

It's important to note that there is no "Boston College Hospital" as such. Boston College is a private Jesuit research university located in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, and does not operate its own hospital. The confusion might arise from the fact that Professor Thomas Seyfried is affiliated with Boston College's Biology Department.

However, Boston College does have a strong commitment to healthcare education and research, particularly through its Connell School of Nursing and various research programs. The university's approach to healthcare is influenced by its Jesuit tradition, emphasizing:

- Holistic care that addresses physical, mental, and spiritual well-being
- Social justice and equity in healthcare access
- Ethical considerations in medical research and practice
- Interdisciplinary collaboration to address complex health challenges

While not directly operating a hospital, Boston College contributes to healthcare through education, research, and community outreach programs, aligning with its mission of service to others and the pursuit of knowledge.

Remember to stay hydrated and consider supplementing with electrolytes. Adjust portion sizes as needed to meet your caloric requirements. It's also important to monitor your ketone levels to ensure you're reaching and maintaining ketosis.

  

  

While maintaining a keto diet, it can be challenging to get enough fiber, but there are several ways to increase your fiber intake while staying in ketosis:

- Include low-carb vegetables: Leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts are high in fiber but low in net carbs
- Add chia seeds or flaxseeds to your meals: These seeds are high in fiber and healthy fats, making them perfect for a keto diet
- Incorporate avocados: They're high in fiber and healthy fats, fitting well into a keto meal plan
- Use psyllium husk: This is a pure fiber supplement that can be added to drinks or keto-friendly baked goods
- Consider coconut: Unsweetened coconut flakes or coconut flour are good sources of fiber that can be incorporated into keto meals

Remember to increase your fiber intake gradually and drink plenty of water to avoid digestive discomfort. Always consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet.
