- **Varied experiences:** The three participants had different reactions to the fast, with some feeling energized at times and others consistently fatigued.
- **Weight loss:** Participants lost weight during the fast, but most of it was regained within a week, suggesting it's not an effective long-term weight loss strategy.
- **Challenges:** Hunger, irritability, and fatigue were common issues, especially in the later stages of the fast.
- Potential benefits: Some participants reported feeling mentally clear or "superhuman" at certain points, though these effects were temporary.
- Conclusion: While the fast provided insights into their relationships with food, the participants generally agreed it wasn't something they'd eagerly repeat due to the difficulties and lack of sustainable benefits.

going to try to power through it and I

just hope that uh the rest of the day I

kind of have a bit of a recovery cuz

right now I'm struggling man A lot of

people do fast for different reasons

whether that be religion weight loss a

cleanse but for me personally I just

wanted to see if I could do it it was

more about the challenge I want to see

if I'm capable of having the willpower

to get it done and seeing as we're about

halfway done I'm not sure if I can do it

but I am trying my best because for the

people who do it for maybe the weight

loss or the extreme cleanses I'm not so

much into that because I've already kind

of found out what works for me it's the

single ingredient whole healthy foods

it's the consistent exercise routine

focusing on the Progressive overload

those have been the building blocks to

my success in regards to my health so

with this I'm not looking for any kind

of extreme shortcut I'm just looking to

see if I can do it so currently I'm on

my way to my brothers at the moment I

talked to him on the phone and I was

letting him know how fatigued I've been

and he asked if my ketosis tester Ketone

tester had a test for glucose as well

because he was letting me know that when

it your glucose levels drops too low

while that can be the cause of fatigue

and also it can start to be too

dangerous so

I'm on my way to his house right now

because they have a glucose tester I'm

going to take my Ketone levels but also

my glucose levels to see if in fact they

are very

[Music]

low it's so interesting how you're me

yesterday yeah and I think a lot of it

boils down to the fact that me and AA

did that prep we went low carb I got off

coffee we were kind of a few days ahead

of Brandon so it seems like you're

basically 24 hours behind yeah which

makes sense I guess and I think that was

one thing that maybe is hold me back a

little bit or making me feel the way I

do is that I didn't really prep for it I

didn't go low carb I didn't go no coffee

and I'm paying the price Brandon went

all in bab I did I was like he just goes

to the pool he doesn't care if it's hot

he doesn't care if it's deep he just

jumps in and I don't care if I can't

swim I just jump in that's braon style

yeah yeah so it has been exactly 48

hours since we started started our fast

and I think we're going to say goodbye

to

AA bye she's being cast off the island

for safety reasons her glucose is pretty

low you started your period

unfortunately um that's obviously

something you want to be really careful

of so Safety First still very proud of

myself to go that far but I'm just I'm

not feeling so now for the next 24 hours

I get to see auga rehydrate and enjoy

herself I think I'll still take it

pretty slow and try try to just sip on a

bond broth today and maybe have low carb

breakfast tomorrow and just take the

portion slowly because I think from what

I found out is actually the worst part

is when you fast and then you go eating

a lot right away and that can actually

be pretty dangerous as well it's going

to tastes like the best bone broth

you've ever had good job 48 hours thank

you hell

yeah it is a little past 6:00 a.m. I

just woke up decided to go

outside I feel extremely different on

the beginning of day three last night I

felt this kind of shift where food

didn't matter anymore it's it's really

hard to describe cuz I don't think I've

ever felt this way I just felt um

satisfied I didn't feel like I was

hungry I didn't really feel anything in

regards to needing a meal needing

calories and I feel that same way now I

woke up today energized feeling great um

no hunger pains at all so there has

definitely been a shift which has taken

place between the end of day two and the

beginning of day three making breakfast

for the kids having some

oatmeal I am pretty much Beyond looking

at food and instantly getting hungry now

which is a good thing but I've got 12

hours left I don't know if I can keep up

this habit for that

long think I'm going to make it

yeah but last night I showed you frozen

grapes and that's one of your favorite

foods but you just kept going it was

kind of

silly Daddy is very silly right now so

it is the morning of the third day and

I'm going to be weighing in and also

checking out my physique and after

weighing in it looks like I lost around

4 lbs and I definitely look a little bit

leaner which isn't a huge surprise

because obviously I've been fasting for

60 hours now my body is very deet Ed but

I want to see if I'm actually in ketosis

I'm going to be taking a ketone test and

seeing where I'm at and it looks like

I'm 1.1 and the optimal Ketone zone is

around 1 to 2.5 so I'm definitely in

that now but I have to be honest after

these 60 hours I never really felt good

I felt fatigued I always felt hungry and

a lot of times they'll say that after

day two you don't feel hungry at all and

you start to feel a lot better which for

me was the complete opposite I actually

started feeling worse even today I just

feel like I'm in a brain fog I still

feel fatigued and I think at this point

I'm going to be calling a quits I know

it's so close I only have another 12

hours but you know I I think I just want

to feel good at this point so I'm going

to be introducing some bone broth into

my system and then shortly after that

get a little bit of food in there too

but I want to kind of slowly introduce

that in instead of just have this huge

meal at least that's what's recommended

which I would agree with I don't want to

get sick oh yeah God that's good just

got off the phone with Brandon heard the

news and I guess this makes me the

winner and now I know what winning feels

like you feel hungry and you feel alone

I've got 8 hours left wish me luck

somehow I've made it to day three and

even though I'm alone here's what I am

possibly going to look forward to that's

going to be an immune function increase

and a stem cell production increase and

best of all at 8:00 p.m. tonight I get

to have my first bite of food again

which I'm going to have to ease into

really slow in order to prevent myself

from refeeding too quickly so I am

probably going to go with a little bit

of bone broth which at this point sounds

like a damn Feast I woke up this morning

pumped and I am not feeling pumped now I

am the opposite of Pumped I've been

trying to keep myself busy working away

but it's I can't avoid it anymore I want

to eat bad and I've got a couple hours

left to go I'm going to try to stay as

occupied as I can to keep my mind off of

wanting food but these last couple hours

are going to be

excruciating but I'm going to try my

best to make

it alone and hungry our final buff dude

searches for answers to questions his

brain simply doesn't have the energy to

process his character continues to erode

this man once so full of life and

happiness has been reduced to a moody

temperamental a sad sight

indeed it's past the point of being it

was never fun first of all but it's past

the point of even being something that

there's even an inkling of curiosity

about now I just want it to be over I'm

really grumpy

this is a video so I can cut out the

more the bits I don't want you to see

but believe me I've basically been a

complete these last couple hours

I'm using the little bit of energy I

have now to talk to you and to put this

big fat fake smile on my face but I am

ready to eat I felt great up until about

midday on today day three but now I just

want this to be over man

[Music]

[Applause]

the fast is finished we all

survived thoughts I will do it again

okay that was I wasn't expecting that it

was a very strange experiment because I

would say from about the 900 p.m. to

noon the next day for me personally I

felt am amazing on days 2 and three

almost like a superhero but with good

things comes bad things because after

that period I was hungry I was irritable

I really learned how much I loved food

so if anything I think this experiment

really made me appreciate food I was a

bit of the opposite as Hudson I felt the

first day was easy and the next two were

the hardest for me I felt more hungry I

felt more lethargic so it was kind of

interesting how that worked I did a

little bit different I didn't do the low

carb no coffee leading up to it so maybe

that was part of it if I would do it

again which I probably wouldn't cuz

honestly at this point I hate fasting

we've done intermittent fasting I've

done the omad the one meal a day and now

the 3-day water fast I'm done with

fasting honestly I wouldn't do it again

I didn't see any like effects from it

any positives from it and you know

internally you don't know what's going

on there could be some some positive

effects but I didn't feel any all I did

is feel hunger so I think I'll

definitely pass on the next fasting

Challenge and I think for me it's the

opposite since it was the first time

I've ever tried to fast and in the

beginning it was actually going pretty

good but then I for unfortunately I got

my period I started having horrible back

ache and I just couldn't continue and

that's where I think I would like to try

it again and I actually would be

interested in doing it one more time to

see if it's the exact same or to see if

maybe I'm a little bit more ready for

the challenge this is me sticking my gut

out out as as far as I can which is

insane I can't do my fat gut trick

anymore and it it's throwing me off

right now so there we go the 3-day water

fast you can see the results there

definitely was results um as with

everything though I want to say again

there's really no shortcut as far as

Extreme Weight Loss extreme cleansing we

really value

consistency but for other reasons it was

to explore my relationship with food and

my appreciation for food I agree and

that was that was the biggest Plus for

me I feel like uh just you just

appreciate the food and you want to eat

healthy foods I think it was like a

restart almost where afterwards I was

like wow I really want to nourish my

body and you know and that feels right

but I ain't doing fasting so you ain't

convincing brand I get it it's a mental

Challenge and that was fun to to test

yourself to push yourself in that way

but honestly how much how many

challenges must we put Brandon through

hope you enjoyed the episode hope you

got some key insights into three

different perspectives so until next

time stay B I lost 11 lbs in 3 days but

what does it look like one week later

I'm weighing in as you can see I've

gained almost everything back so it kind

of reaffirms to me that as an extreme

weight loss option it really isn't that

viable or sustainable in my opinion

again I valued it in other ways but in

regards to rapid weight loss as you can

see it doesn't really work that well

you're just going to gain it all back
