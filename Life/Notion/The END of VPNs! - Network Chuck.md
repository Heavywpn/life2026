Transcipt: "# http://tactiq.io/ free youtube transcript# the END of VPNs?!# https://www.youtube.com/watch/IYmXPF3XUwo00:00:00.150 Throw your VPN in the trash,you don't need it anymore.00:00:03.570 I found something better. Like seriously,00:00:05.460 while my team and I were gone for threeweeks working on a top secret project00:00:08.670 for a pretty big YouTuber .00:00:10.710 I was just telling everyone how Nick waslazy and didn't finish his edit before00:00:14.460 the trip. Oh yeah, I only stayed up.00:00:17.010 Till one. I can't tell you about it.Don't even ask me. I'll tell you later.00:00:19.590 We needed a secure wicked fasts wayto access all of our stuff back home.00:00:23.550 Things like my big fat NASS remote desktopinto our editing machines and even my00:00:27.450 home lab to watch some flex. That'skind of what VPN is for, right? I mean,00:00:30.900 sure I could have set it up,but I didn't have the time.00:00:32.910 And the solution I found took about fiveminutes. And this one might shock you.00:00:36.270 VPN is not secure enough.00:00:37.600 Like when I give my twoknucklehead editors VP in access,00:00:40.800 they get access to everything serversthey shouldn't touch and they have a nasty00:00:44.160 habit of downloading free ramp.00:00:45.600 And if they already have malware and theycan blast it out to my entire network,00:00:49.050 what I need is a solution that givesthem access to only stuff they need.00:00:52.530 Nothing else.00:00:53.400 This is a little technique calledzero trust because I zero trust them.00:00:57.300 And listen, it's not just security aftersome research, VPN is kind of the uh,00:01:02.730 kind of the old way of doingthings and old as lane. I mean,00:01:07.565 have you seen the new stuff? It's http://crazy.so/ what I found, it's kind of amazing.00:01:12.180 It's called Twin Gate. It's a zerotrust, remote access solution, buzzwords,00:01:15.630 blah blah blah. It basically means magicand it checks all my boxes. Watch this.00:01:20.010 In about five minutes,I deploy the Twin Gate,00:01:22.050 Docker container to my studionetwork, my home lab network,00:01:25.230 and even some private networksin the cloud. And just like that,00:01:28.200 I can connect from anywhere no matterwhere I go, no firewall config,00:01:31.950 no port forwarding and just works.00:01:33.660 And I don't care if you have CGNat or some weird I S P issues.00:01:37.830 It just does its thing kindof scary, easy actually.00:01:40.650 I have granular control on whateach person on my team can access.00:01:44.370 I can even say, you could only accessthis machine on this port and that's it.00:01:48.060 I can even control what they'reallowed to access stuff with.00:01:50.646 Like I could say they can use iPhonesbut no Android and that just makes sense.00:01:54.570 And if they're using Windows, I canrequire antivirus firewall settings.00:01:58.230 And if they don't have 'em, theycan't connect. And the crazy part,00:02:01.110 this is free, free for up to fiveusers and that covers my business.00:02:05.010 So let's get this set upin your network right now.00:02:07.560 I'll walk you throughevery step. It'll be quick,00:02:09.580 no longer than it taste tobrew a cup of coffee, trust me.00:02:12.150 And speaking of coffee,go ahead and do that.00:02:13.800 Grab you some because everythingin it requires coffee.00:02:19.440 Also,00:02:19.860 shout out to Twin Gate for helping mesolve my remote access problems and for00:02:23.100 sponsoring this video.00:02:24.210 Now I'm pretty picky about sponsorsand Twin Gate makes the cut. I love it.00:02:27.660 It's something I actuallyuse for everything and Iknow this will provide a ton00:02:31.290 of value to you. So let's get intoit. Actually, you know, real quick,00:02:34.350 have you hacked theYouTube algorithm today?00:02:36.390 Let's make sure you do hit thatlike button notification bell.00:02:38.220 Come and subscribe to everything. Yes,you gotta hack YouTube today ethically,00:02:43.260 of course. Now here's the setup.We have our network for me,00:02:45.990 it's my studio for you, it mightbe your home lab or your business.00:02:48.720 The goal here is to get my knuckleheadeditors access to what they need inside00:02:53.040 my network. So Income's TwinGate. Twin Gate has four parts.00:02:56.640 And don't let that scare you. You'llhave to worry about two of 'em.00:02:58.800 I'm telling you, this is not complex, atleast the setup. We've got our client,00:03:02.200 our connector, ourcontroller, and our relay.00:03:05.350 Right now we're gonna focus onthe connector and the controller.00:03:08.020 The controller is managed byTwin Gate. It's in their cloud,00:03:10.630 and it's what we'll use to sign up fora free account and configure all our00:03:13.395 stuff and who has accessto what the connector is,00:03:15.820 the docker container you'regonna put inside of your network,00:03:18.700 behind your firewall.00:03:19.810 And all you have to know about theconnector is that it connects stuff.00:03:22.750 That's all you have to know.00:03:23.560 I think that's the only twosteps we have to worry about.00:03:25.660 Set up an account on TwinGate, which is the controller,00:03:28.270 and then deploy the connectorinside our network. Done.00:03:32.140 Now that does beg the question, whatdo we need for this? Only two things.00:03:35.800 First, you'll need something to put thatDocker container on some type of Lennox00:03:40.510 server. This could be your nas, anold laptop, even a raspberry pie,00:03:44.110 which is what I'm goingto demo on right now.00:03:46.000 And the second thing you shouldalready have in your hand right now,00:03:48.430 a cup of coffee. Like I said, everythingin it requires coffee. Say it with me,00:03:52.240 I'm not gonna do it again, butseriously, get some coffee.00:03:54.430 First step is the controller. So headout to twin http://gates.com/. That's simple.00:03:58.330 That's it. It's time toditch your vpn. Dang right.00:04:00.550 And right here in the middle, we'regonna click on try Twin Gate for free.00:04:03.520 Try twin gate, try twin gates. Say that10 times fast. That's ridiculously hard.00:04:07.000 Click it here. Pick your poison.What do you wanna log in with?00:04:09.940 I'm gonna log in with GitHub,click on that authorize twin gate.00:04:13.060 And here we have some details.Now if you're like, okay,00:04:15.760 I'm setting this up for my home lab, Idon't have a company name, don't worry,00:04:18.910 they're gonna give you a business trialfor 14 days, no credit card, whatever.00:04:22.000 You're gonna have that starter plan forfree forever. So make up a company name.00:04:25.600 I'm gonna name my own hack, well technumber of employees under a hundred.00:04:29.350 Let's finish it up. Skip allthis, blah, blah, blah. No,00:04:32.050 I don't need technical support. I'm good.I can run C commands, I promise I can.00:04:35.260 And then choose your url. I'llleave it at Hack Wall Tech.00:04:37.750 Good to go create that network. So atthis point you have a twin Gate account,00:04:41.380 you have a controller. Now all wehave to do is configure a few things.00:04:44.590 There are two thingswe're gonna start with,00:04:46.000 and it's actually tellingyou right here at step one,00:04:48.070 the first thing we'll setup is your remote network,00:04:49.490 which will be your home lab,studio, business, whatever.00:04:52.810 And once we defined it here,00:04:53.980 we can actually deploy ourconnector to connect everything up.00:04:57.790 The second thing will configureresources. By default,00:05:00.370 you can't access anything.00:05:01.480 So you have to specifically explicitlydefine what you are allowed to access in00:05:06.370 your network. I love that. Zerotrust. All right, let's go.00:05:09.340 Let's knock out the network first.00:05:10.990 You'll notice right down here we have adda remote network. Let's click on that.00:05:15.100 Choose your location. Noticeyou have some options.00:05:17.560 What I care about right now ison-premise, and I'll name it Hack well00:05:23.980 hq, add Remote Network. Man, that wasso hard, right? , that was easy.00:05:27.240 And we're almost done actually. Now todeploy our connector inside the network.00:05:31.240 Notice they have two connectorsover here, but they're not deployed.00:05:34.810 And notice they do want you to deploytwo, you can deploy one, that's fine.00:05:38.230 But if you want redundancy and highavailability, you can deploy two.00:05:41.290 But we'll start with one, butwhich one to pick? Impetuous,00:05:44.290 jagar or Optimal Vulture. Ican pronounce this better.00:05:48.130 I'm gonna go with that one.00:05:48.910 So we'll click on deploy connector andwe'll choose how we're going to deploy00:05:51.910 this. Now, I talked about this Docker,00:05:54.070 docker's so easy we're gonna go withthat, but you do have options. Step,00:05:57.350 we're gonna generate ourtokens. What are those?00:05:59.930 We'll cover more about thathere in a bit. In fact,00:06:01.880 I'm gonna go kind of nerdy on you andexplain the magic of how this works.00:06:05.540 But let's set this up. First. We'llgo ahead and generate our tokens.00:06:08.120 Click on generate tokens, and it willask you to authenticate yourself again,00:06:11.480 which is great security.00:06:13.040 And you'll notice you do have youraccess and refresh tokens generated.00:06:16.280 And then we'll scrollon down to step four.00:06:18.710 And all we have to do here is copy andpaste this Docker run command and we're00:06:22.585 good to go. So I'll pause here for asecond. Let's get logged into the device.00:06:25.610 We're going to install our twin gateconnector on. For me it's a raspberry pie.00:06:29.810 So here in Windows I'm gonna launch myterminal and I'll ssh into my raspberry00:06:33.320 pie. And before we copyand paste our command,00:06:35.660 let's just make sure we have Dockerinstalled, and that's super easy. First,00:06:38.630 we'll update our repositories,pseudo p t update,00:06:41.870 and then we'll install Dockerpseudo apt install http://docker.io/00:06:46.760 dash y. Mine is already installed,but it should go pretty quick for you.00:06:49.910 And now literally all wehave to do is copy and paste.00:06:53.330 So we'll get back to our browserhere, click the copy command,00:06:56.000 go back to our terminal and paste. Andyou may have to run this as pseudo.00:06:59.840 I wanna do a control A,00:07:01.250 run it as pseudo at the beginning andthen hit enter and let the party start.00:07:05.600 Who, ah, I love seeing this quickcoffee break while the show's happening.00:07:08.870 Just enjoy the show.00:07:12.770 And that was it. So real quickwhile we're here on the terminal,00:07:16.220 before we leave, let's type inpseudo docker PS to make sure it's,00:07:20.780 it's in there running. Andthere it is, it's running.00:07:22.670 And now if we get back to ourtwinge controller, aka http://twinge.com/,00:07:27.290 there it is. Our connection status,the optimal vulture is connected.00:07:31.400 Now let's add some resources. Let'sget back to our network up here.00:07:34.790 Click on that. And we don'treally need this right now.00:07:36.710 So let's just click on dismiss.00:07:38.030 And right here you'll seean add resource button.00:07:40.250 Let's click on that Add resource.00:07:41.840 The first thing we'll dois choose a remote network.00:07:43.760 I'm gonna pick Hack well hq. And yes,00:07:45.830 that does mean you can havemore than one remote network.00:07:47.740 So add your parents' house at grandma'shouse, your friend's house, whatever.00:07:51.080 You can do that. Then we'll specify ourhost. Now we can use DNS or IP address.00:07:55.160 And this DNS thing, by the way, is crazy.00:07:57.740 We'll cover that here in a bit for now.00:07:59.270 We'll focus on IP addressto keep things simple.00:08:01.190 So choose cider label what you'resetting up. I'm gonna access my nas.00:08:04.220 First big fat nas. Then the IP address.00:08:08.780 Keep in mind, this will beyour private IP address aside,00:08:11.300 your home network or yourbusiness network, whatever it is.00:08:14.120 Then also notice we have an alias option.00:08:16.430 We'll cover that when we talk about dns.But again, this whole thing is insane.00:08:20.120 It's magic. I can't wait to tellyou that though. But let, let's,00:08:22.310 let's keep moving forward. Nextwe have protocol restrictions.00:08:24.740 And what I wanna do is have myeditors only access my NASS on Port00:08:29.240 5,000, which is the gooey. So Iclick on protocol restrictions.00:08:33.169 Right now everything'sallowed, may not want that.00:08:35.539 So we'll say TCP restrict and we'llspecify the ports. I'll say 5,000.00:08:40.220 And then I'll block UDP andblock I C M P. So at this point,00:08:44.930 only port 5,000 TCP is allowed.That's all we care about right now.00:08:49.100 I'm gonna click on ad resource.And then as soon as you do that,00:08:51.475 you can choose who has access to thisresource for now we have one group.00:08:55.050 That's everyone. I'll go ahead and addthat. We can change that at any time.00:08:58.950 And I'll click on add one http://group.so/ right now we have a resource.00:09:01.800 If I hover over this guy right here,00:09:03.540 it'll tell me exactly what'sallowed TCP 5,000. That's it.00:09:06.660 So what do you say we tested out? Whichby the way, you just set up Twin Gate,00:09:09.990 like that was it. That's all it took.Now we have to worry about is the client.00:09:13.290 The third piece,00:09:14.670 which is just installing an appand logging in super hard .00:09:18.480 Let's try that right now. Allright, I got my laptop here.00:09:20.670 I wanna download the Twin Gate clientby heading out to twin http://gate.com/download00:09:25.050 cuz I'm using Windows. I'llclick on download for Windows.00:09:27.450 They have an app for everything. Mac, goWest, iPhone, Android, whatever. It's,00:09:30.630 I'll open the file and install thesucker and click on finish. Ugh.00:09:34.440 And a restart. I hate restartingthis stuff. One moment. Now,00:09:37.020 before I configure TwinGate, like any good magician,00:09:39.480 let me show you that I can'taccess my stuff. First.00:09:42.150 I want to make sure I'm connectedto my 5G connection on my phone.00:09:45.395 Now let's try and access my NASSfour, 5,000. It's not looking good.00:09:49.080 Can't reach the page. Nowlet's sign into twinge.00:09:51.270 I'll connect to Hack Well Tech, that'swhen I named it, right? Yeah, I think so.00:09:55.140 I'll join that network, sign in withmy GitHub and we should be good to go.00:09:59.580 I'm gonna close my browser windowreal quick. It already happened.00:10:02.610 Look at that 5,000. I'm going over it,man. Look at my tray right now. Yes,00:10:07.350 I can see I'm connected.Oh, that's so stinking cool.00:10:09.990 I love this but I shouldn't be ableto ping anything. Let's see. Yeah,00:10:13.800 nothing campaign it. We disabledIC m p, let's try S ssh. Nothing.00:10:17.880 Let me nail it real quick.Actually, I wanna test this.00:10:19.890 Now we're rolling then I'm gonnajust edit it real quick and add00:10:24.690 port 22. Let's see what happens.Confirm changes. Let's try it now. Oh,00:10:29.280 took a minute, but I'm in justlike that. How cool is that?00:10:32.490 Now at this point you've configuredTwin Gate, like it works, it's amazing.00:10:35.670 But there's more we can do. There'sDNS based routing, device security,00:10:39.270 and we're gonna walk through all thathere in a moment. But if you're like me,00:10:42.090 kind of a nerd, you can't just walkaway from this video thinking, okay,00:10:45.060 I've got the fastest, most secureway to connect to my stuff.00:10:47.670 But you have to know how it works,right? Like how is this thing working?00:10:50.760 Let's talk about that Nowlet's get a bit nerdy.00:10:52.980 Let's pop the hood on thisthing and see what's going on.00:10:54.960 What's the magic that's makingall this tick? And it's,00:10:57.120 it's actually really cool. Ican't wait to show you now.00:10:58.980 I'll start with this Twin gate. It's,it's not a p n, it's not .00:11:02.460 Let me explain Now, the goal forTwin Gate is this right here,00:11:05.160 a secure end-to-end TLS tunnel. It'speer-to-peer between the client,00:11:09.330 which is you or your family oryour employees, friends, whatever,00:11:12.390 and the connector inside yournetwork. But how does this happen?00:11:15.450 Especially with networksthat don't play nice.00:11:17.250 They have like CG Nat Dynamic IP addressesand all the craziness our ISPs put us00:11:21.425 through. Because trust me, if youhave those networks, this thing just,00:11:24.120 it just works. But how,00:11:25.950 let's start with the connectorcuz he does most of the work.00:11:28.110 The connector is this guy.00:11:29.040 Let's talk about how theconnector was born real quick.00:11:30.870 So you may recall in our controller here,00:11:32.700 we deploy the connector inside thecontroller, the optimal vulture.00:11:35.790 When we did that, we had to generatea couple of tokens like, like this.00:11:39.030 If I try to deploy anotherconnector, I'll say generate tokens,00:11:41.640 have to authenticateagain. And there they are.00:11:43.470 I point this out because this isa key part of Twin Gate security.00:11:47.010 They use more tokens than Chuck E Cheeseand that's how they authenticate with00:11:49.950 each other.00:11:50.400 So when we deploy this docker runcommand baked in with these Chucky cheese00:11:54.460 tokens and when the twin Gateconnector came up in our network,00:11:57.280 he talked to the controller and said,Hey, here I am. Here's my tokens.00:12:00.460 And they, they were friendsnow cuz he knew who he was.00:12:02.890 So he gives him thetokens and then exchange.00:12:04.660 The controller tells a connectoreverything he needs to know.00:12:07.420 Two really important thingswe're gonna focus on right now.00:12:09.570 First is an ACL and access control list.00:12:12.460 This tells the connector who'sallowed to come into the network.00:12:14.830 It's a list of allowed devices andwhat they're allowed to access.00:12:17.320 We define that. Remember wedid that inside the controller.00:12:19.660 So the controller's givingthe connector that list,00:12:21.940 he's also telling him about Mr. Relay.00:12:24.370 Remember Twin Gate has four componentsand this is the fourth one we have not00:12:27.490 talked about yet. So thecontroller says, Hey,00:12:28.936 here's a few relays that youcan connect to. Now the relays,00:12:32.170 I'll tell you more about whatthose are here in a moment.00:12:33.790 Much like the controller,00:12:34.630 they're hosted inside Twin Gates networkso you don't have to worry about it.00:12:37.870 I'll put the relaysright here in my beard.00:12:40.150 Now the relay's job is simple butsuper important. He's the matchmaker.00:12:43.960 He helps the client,00:12:45.010 my knucklehead video editors andthe connector discovery each other,00:12:48.340 find out how to meet. He'sthe guy that does that.00:12:50.710 The kind of play in love is blind rightnow they're talking behind a wall.00:12:53.530 Let's take down that wall.00:12:57.040 Just a hug.00:12:58.140 Now here's how the clientand the connector connect.00:13:00.670 The first thing that'll happenis the connector will connect.00:13:03.430 He's such a connector.00:13:04.720 He'll connect with a relay and he guesseswhat he uses to authenticate  a00:13:08.620 token. It's actually a token from thecontroller to say, Hey, I know this guy,00:13:13.360 we both know him. We're friends, we'regood. Not on the flip side, the client,00:13:17.290 it's doing the same thing.00:13:18.460 It did the whole token thing of thecontroller when it authenticated and it00:13:21.940 connects to a relay.00:13:23.200 So now that the client and theconnector are talking to the relay,00:13:25.810 the relay can now introducethem. He's the matchmaker,00:13:28.330 but he's doing more than you might thinkcuz there's a pretty big problem he's00:13:31.065 solving right now. And thisis why we even need a relay.00:13:33.550 The problem is that the devices in yournetwork are nestled safely behind a00:13:36.940 firewall or a router and they're somewhatkind of sheltered from the internet.00:13:40.540 The internet can't touch them. Andthat's by design. That's a good thing.00:13:42.796 Your devices don't evenhave a public IP address,00:13:45.160 which is what they need to talkto everyone on the internet.00:13:47.710 Usually your router is the one that hasthe public IP address and he allows the00:13:51.645 devices on your network. So thinkyou're nas, your twin gate connector,00:13:56.050 your editing PCs.00:13:57.190 He allows those devices to use thepublic IP whenever they want to talk to00:14:01.090 people. This is a magical technologycalled nat or network address translation.00:14:05.290 So what this means is thatyour computer, for example,00:14:07.240 has no problem talking to the internetwhen it tries to go out and talk to a00:14:10.780 website. The router will letit use its public IP address.00:14:14.320 It'll actually give it alittle identifier, a port,00:14:16.870 let's say 5 1 7 90 with that identifierthat port your computer can talk to00:14:21.880 any website it wants. It works great.00:14:23.530 And when the website wants to send aphoto back or a meme or whatever you're00:14:26.530 doing, it knows that this camefrom 1 5, 9, 7 4, 1, 2, 2, 1 1 3,00:14:31.540 port 51, 7, 9, 0.00:14:33.880 So when it talks back to yourcomputer and it gets to your router,00:14:37.570 your router goes, oh, this is 4507 90. When they get that right to 'em.00:14:41.740 Now Nat and these randomly assigned portsare great for your computer to connect00:14:45.370 to stuff on the internet,but not great at all.00:14:47.710  for things to connect back to it.00:14:49.810 So the Twin Gate client can'tstart talking to your computer.00:14:52.790 There's no door open there. Andthat's where the relays come in.00:14:55.430 The relay does something really cleverand it's so cool when you really think00:14:58.460 about it.00:14:58.760 So you know the example I gave you ofyour computer connecting to a website and00:15:02.300 using a randomly assigned port using that.00:15:04.400 It uses that to build thatpeer-to-peer connection. So watch this,00:15:07.646 your connector inside your network,it's connected to the relay, right?00:15:11.300 We've got a connection,00:15:12.230 which means he's gonna have a public IPand a randomly assigned port from Nat00:15:16.765 from your router.00:15:17.570 So IP and port and the relay knowsthat because he has that connection.00:15:21.230 On the other side of things,you using the Twin Gate client,00:15:24.410 you're probably using Nat toowifi at Starbucks airport,00:15:27.350 some secret YouTuberstudio, whatever it is.00:15:29.750 So you get your public IP and theyrandomly assign port and the client has a00:15:33.500 connection with the relay. Soright at this moment, look at this,00:15:36.530 the relay has a connection withthe connector and the client,00:15:39.710 he knows their public IP addresses andhe knows the port that Nats using to00:15:43.490 reach back to them. So the relay goes,lemme just tell them where they are.00:15:48.110 Let me,00:15:48.290 let me tell both these guys where theyare so they can talk to each other.00:15:51.080 And that's exactly what happens.The relay tells the client, Hey,00:15:54.230 if you want to talk to the connector,here's his IP address in port.00:15:57.140 And he tells the connector, Hey,if you wanna talk to the client,00:15:59.330 here's his IP address in port. Andwith that magic information supplied,00:16:03.830 bam, we get a connection.00:16:05.570 They know how to find each other ina secure end-to-end TLS tunnel is00:16:10.010 established. Now thismagic does have a name,00:16:12.440 it's called Nat Traversal because we'retraversing all these NAT servers to make00:16:17.305 a direct connection,00:16:18.140 which is pretty hard to do when thingsare kind of hidden behind random ports.00:16:21.640 That's why we need a server like a relay.00:16:24.740 This is actually operatingas a stun server.00:16:26.870 Stun does this kind of stuff and itfacilitates those connections. Whoa,00:16:30.710 why is there a virus onthis pc? Let me remove that,00:16:33.680 how embarrassing I left that there.00:16:35.990 Now a couple of things about howthis connection business works.00:16:39.320 A couple of highlights. Thisthing is secure. Like I said,00:16:42.320 twin Gate is using moretokens than Chuck E. Cheese.00:16:44.510 Every single interaction wasauthenticated with a token.00:16:47.900 This TLS tunnel is usingpenned certificates,00:16:50.630 which makes it darn near impossibleto do a man in the middle attack.00:16:53.540 And honestly, I'm not doing it justice.00:16:55.070 If you wanna dive deeper into how likeall the authentication and tokenizing00:16:58.640 stuff is working, I've gottadocument below, check it out.00:17:01.640 The second thing is that this isnot a VPN n I mentioned it before.00:17:05.240 So you're probably like, wellChuck, if it's not vpn, what is it?00:17:07.460 It's a proxy actually.00:17:08.630 It's a super secure private proxy andspecifically the connector inside your00:17:12.770 network is operating it as a proxy.00:17:15.230 They work by terminatingnetwork connections andthey'll do some fancy stuff for00:17:18.530 that traffic. They'llmanipulate it, validate it,00:17:20.599 and forward the traffic on to itscorrect destination. It's very,00:17:23.720 very programmable and and custom. Thethird thing I want you to know is, uh,00:17:27.380 this sucker's quick and no,00:17:29.120 I didn't forget how to spell Quick is a new protocol.00:17:32.060 If you haven't heard of this.00:17:32.950 It's a transport layer protocol forall your network uh, nerds out there.00:17:36.230 It's built on top of U udp and it'sdesigned to be faster and more efficient00:17:40.760 than tcp, which is likewait, you're building on topof UDP to beat TCP ?00:17:45.500 Sure, but that's what it does. Now,quick is taking the internet by storm.00:17:49.200 You're probably already using it rightnow if you did a wire shark capture.00:17:51.540 But here's some of the maindifferences that makes it amazing.00:17:54.390 One of them is multiplexing.Multiplexing is a big one.00:17:57.390 You can send multiple streams of dataover one connection versus this rush hour00:18:01.380 freeway up here that's tcp.00:18:03.360 And what this means for Twin Gate andwhy it's so quick to make connections is00:18:06.990 that it can make a connection offand everything in one round trip.00:18:11.100 Whereas with TCP it might be a bunchof back and forth negotiations and00:18:15.870 time and remitted packetsand all kinds of stuff.00:18:18.240 And one really cool thing that quickdoes, and this is kind of mind blowing,00:18:22.080 but it does client sideroaming or it facilitates that.00:18:24.690 So let's say you as a client are tryingto remain connected to a remote desktop00:18:28.080 session or you're watching a movie onPlex and you go from wifi in your house to00:18:31.560 maybe you're in the car on 5g.00:18:33.660 Normally that switch and connectionrequires a disconnect and reconnect quick00:18:37.775 just keeps connection up. Theconnection survives. It's kind of crazy.00:18:41.280 And then one more thing to note backhaul with traditional V P N when you00:18:44.700 connect,00:18:45.300 it normally means every bit of trafficyou're generating whatever website you go00:18:48.990 to, whether it's on your privatenetwork or on the internet,00:18:52.230 it's gonna go through that VPN N device.00:18:55.200 Literally everything you're doingis going through the VPN N device.00:18:57.810 That's bad for a varietyof reasons. First of all,00:18:59.375 you may not want to have everythingyou're doing be seen by that VPN N device.00:19:02.220 All you wanted was accessto some resources. Second,00:19:04.950 as an IT person is a person tryingto administer a VPN gateway, dude,00:19:08.310 that's a lot of extra traffic thatyou're having to grow your firewall for.00:19:12.030 It's really inefficient.00:19:13.020 But with Twin Gate it does a thingcalled Split tunnel by default,00:19:16.020 which means that only traffic destinedfor the resources you want access,00:19:20.430 go through a twin gate, everythingelse, Facebook, YouTube, it goes out.00:19:23.825 Your standard internet gatewaydoesn't touch twin gay.00:19:26.310 So only the traffic that needs to goacross those security t l s tunnels,00:19:30.870 those end-to-end tunnels,00:19:32.490 the only traffic that goes across thoseis traffic that's supposed to for those00:19:35.430 resources. Now, yes, you can configureSplit Tunnel with a lot of V P N.00:19:39.270 I've done it. It's not easy. Twin Gate is built in by default.00:19:43.590 You don't have to even think aboutit. It just works like that. Okay,00:19:45.750 we popped the hood, wesaw some nerdy stuff.00:19:47.760 Now time to configure some nerdy thingsstarting with something really cool.00:19:51.540 Device security. Now back here in ourtwin gate controller, aka twin http://gate.com/,00:19:55.830 let's do a few things real quick. First,00:19:57.570 we're actually gonna add to ourteam by clicking on team up here,00:20:00.330 adding to your team is real easy. Ifyou wanna add family, friends, whatever,00:20:03.420 I'll click on add user, I'll addmyself to this team, send invite email.00:20:07.710 And what I'll also do is configurea group. So I'll click on groups,00:20:10.440 add a group and say Beards,that's it. Add group.00:20:13.590 And then I'll jump into that group, clickon users and add myself to that group.00:20:16.620 Now here I'm connecting on myphone and you can see I'm on 5g.00:20:19.980 Now I'm connecting through justfine, everything's loading.00:20:21.930 But now let's play with device security.00:20:23.520 So at the top I'll click ondevices and first of all,00:20:25.590 it's pretty cool that you cansee every device connected,00:20:27.870 but what we care about is securityright here. Let's click on that here.00:20:30.930 We can configure security based onminimum OS requirements. So for example,00:20:35.220 I may not want iOS allowed at all.00:20:38.370 So I can go in here and say Block http://ios.so/ now when I try to log into Twin Gate,00:20:43.350 I've got iOS blocked, I can'teven authenticate, I can't get in.00:20:46.740 So you block an entire OS or just enforcegood policies like hey, screen lock,00:20:51.340 let's make sure we have screen lockand maybe like biometric configuration.00:20:54.520 So touch ID if you still have that faceid, things like that. Heck yeah, Linux,00:20:58.720 HD encryption, firewall, windows,goodness gracious, enable the whole thing.00:21:02.920 So that's already super powerful. Also,00:21:04.630 you'll see we have the optionto create a trusted profile.00:21:07.060 Let me show you what thatis. The click on create.00:21:09.010 Let's say we'll do one for Windows.00:21:10.360 Notice here we have theoption to integrate with thirdparty endpoint protection00:21:14.320 stuff, CrowdStrike, Intune, Sentinel One.00:21:16.540 And you can rely on those super advancedprograms to tell you if those devices00:21:19.930 are safe to connect. And ifthey're not trusted by those,00:21:22.190 then they're not trusted byTwin Gates. That's pretty cool.00:21:26.020 Now we also have policieswhere you can define policies.00:21:28.960 The main thing I want you to see inpolicies is the MFA not required.00:21:31.935 Over here you can just straight offthe bat make sure that MFA multifactor00:21:35.740 authentication is required.00:21:37.450 And then going into policies youcan set further requirements.00:21:40.300 Like if you set the defaultpolicy for device security,00:21:43.030 you can manage that to say,Hey, only trusted devices,00:21:45.555 meaning they have to be trustedby CrowdStrike in TuneIn all one.00:21:49.870 Or you can leave it at any deviceas long as they meet device security00:21:52.330 requirements, the minimumOS requirements you've set.00:21:54.580 Now I wanna move on to something prettyfun and it's how Twin Gate handles and00:21:58.270 treats dns. It's kind of crazy.00:22:00.380 So let's get back up tothe network tab over here.00:22:02.830 I don't need to switch to my pen.Ah, there we go. We'll go to network.00:22:05.860 And so far we've added a resourceby specifying the IP address.00:22:09.160 Like here's the IP Twin Gatewill take care of the rest.00:22:12.010 But we also saw how we could use DNS adomain name. Let's try it out real quick.00:22:15.940 So here in my network I'vegot a Prox Box server.00:22:19.330 It's great for hosting virtual machines.00:22:21.010 You can find it via DNS atprox dot hogwarts dot local.00:22:25.810 Now keeping in mind, thisis via my local DNS server.00:22:28.840 So here in my studio and maybe inyour network or your business network,00:22:32.290 you have a DNS http://server.so/ when I ping prox max,00:22:36.010 it replies to the IP address becausemy private DNS server response,00:22:39.610 this is not accessibleon the big wild internet.00:22:42.280 Now how Twin Gate will useyour DNS servers crazy.00:22:44.950 But let's go ahead and add it real quick.00:22:46.120 So I'm gonna have my newemployee I created, which was me.00:22:48.940 I think I'm gonna have me access Proxbox. So we'll click on ad resource,00:22:53.980 we'll choose a remote network. We'llonly have one right now. We'll do dns,00:22:56.500 we'll label it. And thenI'll put in the DNS address,00:22:58.630 which is proxima dot hogwarts dot local.00:23:01.930 Notice I'm not telling it what IPaddress that it is or anything like that.00:23:06.040 I'm just saying the DNS address,the domain name for protocol.00:23:08.830 I'll allow everything just fortesting. And then I'll say only beards.00:23:12.670 Only beards can use this. So I haveone group, which is just gonna be me.00:23:16.180 Now first let's see if it worksbecause I don't wanna lie to you.00:23:18.700 I wanna get logged back in. I got loggedout. Oh I forgot I enforced mfa. Ugh,00:23:23.950 I'm gonna turn it off real quick. ,I don't feel like doing it right now.00:23:27.220 That's just bad security. Okay, cool.00:23:28.960 So I see Product Moss hereand currently I'm on 5g,00:23:31.300 so I'm not on my home network.00:23:32.860 I'm gonna authenticate and then copythe address and try to go to it.00:23:36.070 I'll do https, colon wwa,00:23:38.560 paste it in there and go to pour 8,006for Prox Max proceed. And there we go.00:23:43.510 Just like that. Lemme show youhow that, here's my network,00:23:46.250 here's my Prox MO server andhere's my uh, DNS server,00:23:50.090 which is actually running on a raspberrypie. It's agar. I highly recommend it.00:23:53.690 What's crazy is that the TwinGate connector, he does a lot,00:23:57.080 but what he also doesbeyond everything else,00:23:59.450 well not beyond just also isthat he proxies DNS request.00:24:04.160 He's a DNS proxy. Andhere's what that means.00:24:06.290 So me over here on my Twin Gateclient, I got Twin Gate on my phone.00:24:09.710 There's something kind of weird going onwith your Twin Gate client and by weird00:24:12.685 I mean awesome. This is the only timeI'll mention it using VPN by the way,00:24:16.730 it actually uses a VPN connection onyour phone and whatever device you're00:24:20.810 using, it's a VPNconnection to local host.00:24:24.500 So 1 2 7 0 0 1,00:24:28.250 which we all know that local host onetwo seven zero zero one is itself.00:24:31.940 It's the phone itself.00:24:32.990 It's making a VPN connection back toitself that has one purpose of Twin Gate.00:24:37.040 It's listening and waiting for attemptsto connect to resources and it's a acl.00:24:41.300 So it has a list of things that itknows I'm allowed to connect to,00:24:44.240 blah blah blah blah blah. One ofthose things being proxim max,00:24:46.970 it waits and listens and it goes,oh, oh, that's for me Proxim Max.00:24:50.210 It watches everything. And when it seesit's something meant for Twin Gate,00:24:53.900 it'll take it and send it to the TwinGate connector over its secure TLS Tunnel.00:24:57.470 Now in the case of dns, what it'll do is,00:24:59.330 you know we configured a resourcethat's prox box dot hogwarts dot00:25:03.920 local. When it sees proxbox dot hogwarts dot local,00:25:06.800 it's like okay that's in my list.00:25:08.600 It will then send this over our secureTLS connection TLS Tunnel to the Twin00:25:12.920 Gate connector and the connector willresolve that DNS request with its own00:25:16.880 configured DNS http://server.so/ think about that.00:25:18.830 My twin gate connector that'ssitting inside my network,00:25:21.110 I gave it it's DNS server, whichis my private DNS server here.00:25:24.050 That's what it's using to resolve anyof those domain names I configure inside00:25:28.310 Twin Gate. That's pretty cool.00:25:29.390 And what that empowers me to do is DNSbase routing to different networks,00:25:33.950 which I don't think any othersolution does. It's kind of crazy.00:25:37.730 Now that's cool, but what if you don'thave a DNS server in your house? Well,00:25:40.820 twin Gate has a new feature calledAlias sis. Let's try it out real quick.00:25:44.300 Let's add another resource. Iwanna connect to my Plex server.00:25:46.490 So remote network hack WorldTech,I'll do a an IP address, the alias,00:25:49.670 I can make it whatever I want itto be. Plex dot beards dot awesome.00:25:53.720 I don't know that's what it's gonna be.00:25:54.950 I will only allow port 32,400 for Plex and that's it.00:25:59.330 I'll give me access Beards ofcourse. And that's the Plex server.00:26:03.170 Let's see if that alias works.If this works be kind of crazy,00:26:06.530 let's go to plex dot, beards dot awesome.00:26:10.460 Port 3 2 400. Is it working?Seems to be working.00:26:15.890 It worked. How cool is that?00:26:17.960 Now a couple of things incase you didn't notice this,00:26:20.330 you don't have to addjust individual resources.00:26:22.640 If you wanted to add a oneresource and make that a wild card,00:26:25.850 so either an IP address, saylike my network, do a slash 24,00:26:30.630 make that one resource and youget access to your entire network.00:26:33.560 Same goes for dns, which is prettystinking cool. Just do a wild card.00:26:36.890 I use this heavily by the way. And it'sso stinking cool. Makes things easy.00:26:40.070 At least for me.00:26:40.790 Like I only give myself access tothis and restrict everyone else.00:26:44.400 It just makes sense. Nowbecause this video is so long,00:26:46.740 I'm not gonna demo these last few things,00:26:48.210 but I just wanna touch on them real quickbecause they're so powerful and I do00:26:50.970 use them. If I go overto my team, we the top,00:26:54.600 I've got users groups and then there'sone thing I haven't talked about.00:26:57.270 And that's services. What is that?Click on that. Nothing there.00:27:01.350 What this is though, it's so cool.00:27:03.750 You've seen how we can install a TwinGate cloud on your phone, laptop,00:27:07.080 whatever. But they also haveheadless clients. They got no heads,00:27:11.550 which means you can install them on aLinux server with one command and they00:27:15.845 just work and it's so cool. SoI did this with um, uptime Kuma.00:27:21.030 So I had a LE server in the cloud.00:27:23.190 I installed Uptime Kuma on that and Iinstalled the Twin Gate headless client on00:27:26.760 there. And with that it was able tomonitor everything in my private network.00:27:31.830 And actually I lied. It wasn't myprivate network that was monitoring,00:27:34.530 I was actually doing the top secretYouTube thing I talked to you about.00:27:37.560 I was using this exact setupto monitor a couple hun. Uh,00:27:41.760 I can't tell you it was a lot of devices,but it did it like Twin Gate handle,00:27:45.150 all that. It was a wild car DNS http://setup.it/ was crazy. But services are cool.00:27:49.980 They're not the hardestsetup. It's a one-liner.00:27:51.630 Now what this also opensup is C I C D automation.00:27:55.350 And you can use things like Terraform where you can like just deploy00:27:59.015 infrastructure and with the infrastructurebuilt in the Terraform template,00:28:03.510 is that what they call it?I think it's a template,00:28:04.740 is deploying twin gate connectorsand headless clients and it just,00:28:09.450 you spin up things http://automatically.it/'s kind of crazy.00:28:12.510 So you can automate your access, automateyour zero trust. Two more things.00:28:16.200 If I go over to settings I,twin Gate's, a big thing, man.00:28:18.720 Two things you can look atright now. Identity provider,00:28:21.030 you can sync up GoogleWorkspace, Okta Azure ad.00:28:23.940 I personally use Google Workspace.Pretty cool. I sync up my employees.00:28:27.810 You can also do Secure dns.00:28:29.490 So you can actually have your clientsuse a secure DNS provider using D O H and00:28:33.450 you can specify that here. Sothat's Twin Gate. What do you think?00:28:36.240 Are you gonna throw away your VPN or areyou using something else that you think00:28:39.185 is better fighting? No, I'mjust kidding. But seriously,00:28:41.190 let me know below in the comments.I wanna know what you think.00:28:43.590 Grandma, go subscribe to Network. Chuck.00:28:46.860 What are you doing?"
