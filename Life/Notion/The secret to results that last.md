  

==**The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1% improvement, but 1000 of them. It’s a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each on a fundamental unit of the overall system.**==

  

==**In the beginning, small improvements can often seem meaningless because they get washed away by the weight of the system.**==

  

==**Through a commitment to tiny, sustainable, unrelenting improvements**==

  

> ==**Success is not a goal to reach of a finish line to cross.**  
> **It is a system to improvement, an endless process to refine.**==

  

==**This is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no permanent solution.**==

  

==**Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate through the 4 laws of behaviours change until you find the next bottleneck.**==

1. ==**Make it obvious**==
2. ==**Make it attractive**==
3. ==**Make it easy**==
4. ==**Make it satisfying**==

  

==**Round and round. Always looking for the next way to get 1% better**==

  

==**The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements**==

  

==**It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop**==

  

> ==**Small habits don’t add up, they compound.**==

  

==**That’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes, remarkable results.**==
