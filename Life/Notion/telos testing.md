## THINGS I’VE BEEN WRONG ABOUT

- Thought AI would make project management obsolete by 2023 — it made it more important
- Assumed small businesses don’t care about security — turns out it’s their #1 concern when explained simply
- Believed that waking up at 5AM was impossible for me — but habit stacking proved me wrong

- **I3**: Build “MSP in a Box” with automations + training material
