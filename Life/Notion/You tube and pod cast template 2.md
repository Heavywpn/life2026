Wisdom: "## SUMMARYDr. Anna Lembke discusses addiction, dopamine's role in pleasure and pain, and strategies for achieving balance.## IDEAS:- Dopamine is essential for survival, motivating us to seek out rewards and pleasures.- The brain's pleasure and pain centers are interconnected, influencing addiction behaviors and choices.- Modern technology can hijack our reward systems, leading to increased vulnerability to addiction.- People often misidentify their discomfort and rationalize addictive behaviors as beneficial or necessary.- Exercise can boost dopamine levels without the typical addictive consequences associated with drugs.- Addiction often manifests in seemingly innocuous behaviors, such as compulsive reading or excessive work.- A significant portion of society engages in compulsive overconsumption, often without recognizing it as a problem.- The relationship between pain and pleasure is complex, with both being relative to one another.- Early exposure to addictive substances can lead to lifelong challenges with addiction.- Individuals may struggle to recognize the harm of their behaviors while actively engaging in them.- Substances like cannabis can be addictive and harmful, often leading to psychological issues.- Withdrawal symptoms from addiction can manifest as anxiety, irritability, and insomnia.- The pursuit of pleasure often overshadows the necessary discomfort that fosters growth and resilience.- Being present with discomfort can ultimately lead to greater emotional regulation and fulfillment.- Addiction is not limited to substances; behaviors can also become addictive and damaging.- The rise of technology has created new forms of addiction, particularly among younger generations.## INSIGHTS:- Recognizing the interplay between pleasure and pain is crucial for understanding addiction dynamics.- Acknowledging discomfort can provide a pathway to greater emotional resilience and awareness.- We must actively seek out challenges that encourage growth rather than succumb to avoidance.- Many addictive behaviors arise from the need to escape discomfort or seek immediate gratification.- The modern world often promotes instant pleasures, which can lead to chronic dissatisfaction.- Self-awareness is vital for identifying harmful behaviors masquerading as harmless activities.- Finding balance in today's pleasure-rich environment requires intentional effort and mindfulness.- Awareness of personal triggers can help mitigate the risk of falling into addictive patterns.- Understanding that addiction can stem from various sources, not just trauma, broadens our perspective.- Acknowledging the societal pressures and norms around productivity can help combat work addiction.## QUOTES:- \"Dopamine is fundamental to our survival.\"- \"The same parts of the brain that process pleasure also process pain.\"- \"We automatically seek out pleasure and avoid pain.\"- \"Alcohol works through its own chemical pathway.\"- \"We're all wired to be addicted.\"- \"One hit of a meth pipe is equal to 10 orgasms.\"- \"We've lost the ability to tolerate even minor forms of discomfort.\"- \"Digital media lights up the same reward pathway as drugs and alcohol.\"- \"People can get addicted to behaviors too.\"- \"The brain adapts by down regulating dopamine transmission.\"- \"Every time we do something pleasurable, dopamine affects our behavior.\"- \"The balance wants to remain level.\"- \"It’s okay to be unhappy or restless.\"- \"Addiction is the continued compulsive use of a substance despite harm.\"- \"If we continue to consume our drug of choice, we enter an addicted brain.\"- \"Exercise can help restore homeostasis and positively affect dopamine levels.\"## HABITS:- Engage in physical activities like exercise to boost dopamine naturally and combat cravings.- Practice mindfulness to remain present, reducing the urge to escape discomfort.- Limit exposure to digital media to help reset your reward system and reduce addiction risk.- Set boundaries around work to prevent excessive consumption and burnout.- Implement a regular sleep schedule to maintain emotional regulation and mental clarity.- Explore hobbies that require effort and investment, promoting satisfaction over instant gratification.- Take periodic breaks from addictive behaviors to assess their impact on your well-being.- Engage in social activities that foster genuine connections, counteracting feelings of loneliness.- Maintain a balanced diet to support overall brain health and dopamine production.- Reflect on personal triggers and develop strategies to mitigate their impact on behaviors.## FACTS:- Dopamine release is significantly increased by addictive substances compared to natural rewards.- The average life of a business has decreased from 50 years to around 15 years.- Participation in ultramarathons increased by 1,676% between 1996 to 2008.- Cannabis can lead to psychological symptoms similar to those of other addictive substances.- The human brain can experience a dopamine deficit state even after stopping substance use.- Withdrawal from addictive substances can cause universal symptoms like anxiety and depression.- Digital media can be as addictive as traditional substances, affecting younger generations particularly.- Many people are unaware of their compulsive overconsumption behaviors and their consequences.- The relationship between pleasure and pain is fundamental to understanding addiction in modern life.- Addictive behaviors can stem from a variety of sources, not just childhood trauma.## REFERENCES:- \"Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence\" by Dr. Anna Lembke.- \"Drug Dealer, MD: How Doctors Were Duped, Patients Got Hooked, and Why It's So Hard to Stop\" by Dr. Anna Lembke.- Various studies on addiction, dopamine, and neuroscience discussed in the podcast.## ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAYUnderstanding the complex relationship between dopamine, pleasure, and pain is essential for overcoming addiction.## RECOMMENDATIONS:- Practice self-awareness to identify rationalizations for harmful behaviors and address them.- Engage in activities that require effort to foster genuine satisfaction and reduce reliance on instant gratification.- Develop a support network to help navigate challenges and reduce feelings of isolation.- Reflect regularly on your behaviors and their impact on your mental health and well-being.- Explore new hobbies or interests that challenge you and promote personal growth.- Limit time spent on social media to reduce compulsive scrolling and dopamine-seeking behaviors.- Seek professional help if struggling with addiction to gain tools and strategies for recovery.- Embrace discomfort as a natural part of life, allowing for greater emotional resilience.- Set realistic goals around reducing addictive behaviors and celebrate small victories along the way.- Prioritize sleep and regular exercise to support overall mental health and well-being."

Transcipt: "# http://tactiq.io/ free youtube transcript# Dopamine Expert: Doing This Once A Day Fixes Your Dopamine! What Alcohol Is Doing To Your Brain!# https://www.youtube.com/watch/R6xbXOp7wDA00:00:00.240 there's a very famous experiment in00:00:02.200 which rats were engineered to have no00:00:04.200 dopamine and the scientists discovered00:00:06.160 that if they put food in the rat's mouth00:00:07.919 the rat would eat but if you put the00:00:09.280 food even a body length away the rat00:00:11.000 will starve to death which tells us that00:00:13.519 dopamine is fundamental to get the00:00:15.719 things that we need for our basic00:00:17.439 survival now every time we're doing00:00:19.640 something that's pleasurable from sugar00:00:21.439 to video games work pornography social00:00:23.599 media that will affect dopamine and the00:00:25.680 more dopamine that's released the more00:00:27.240 likely that drug or behavior is to be00:00:29.480 addictive but also the genetic risk of00:00:31.599 addiction is about 50 to 60% so if you00:00:34.200 have a biological parent or grandparent00:00:36.280 with addiction you are more likely to00:00:38.440 develop that addiction we have to keep00:00:40.399 it in balance in order to stay healthy00:00:42.600 Dr Anna lmy is Professor of Psychiatry00:00:44.600 at Stanford chief of the Stanford00:00:46.039 addiction clinic and a world leading00:00:47.719 expert on the subject of doping she will00:00:49.559 tell you how this one powerful chemical00:00:51.120 is controlling your life and what to do00:00:52.879 about it one of the most important00:00:54.399 findings in Neuroscience in the past 7500:00:56.840 years is that the same parts of the00:00:58.399 brain that process pleasure also process00:01:00.559 pain and the balance wants to remain00:01:02.920 level the problem is that we00:01:04.438 automatically seek out pleasure and00:01:06.000 avoid pain and we're exposed to all00:01:07.759 kinds of Pleasures that we have in the00:01:09.240 modern world and our brains are reeling00:01:11.119 in response to try to compensate now I00:01:13.000 need more of my drug and more potent00:01:14.479 forms to get the same effect which then00:01:16.320 leads to addiction and that's what00:01:17.720 happened to me when I got addicted to00:01:19.200 romance novels take me into that phase00:01:21.720 of your life I was out of control and I00:01:23.960 needed to restore a level balance and00:01:25.720 take the advice I

I've00:02:24.840 since this episode was recorded about a00:02:26.360 month ago all I've been thinking about00:02:28.560 is how on Earth I get you to watch this00:02:30.640 and I don't say this often the last time00:02:32.160 I said this was the first time Mo gordak00:02:34.239 came on this podcast this is the second00:02:36.160 time I've said this in almost four years00:02:38.200 of recording this podcast on YouTube and00:02:40.200 the reason for that is so many of the00:02:42.560 things that I know you're struggling00:02:43.680 with in your life that stand in the way00:02:45.319 of the person you want to become that00:02:47.000 relationship you have with your phone00:02:49.319 the00:02:50.400 procrastination the cycles of behavior00:02:53.120 that make you feel embarrassed and full00:02:54.800 of shame that you've just never been00:02:56.040 able to crack all of them all of them I00:02:59.840 genuinely believe for many of you are00:03:01.159 going to be understood today if you00:03:03.120 listen to this episode it has changed my00:03:05.440 life and it has changed much of the00:03:07.360 lives of my team if if I'm wrong here00:03:11.080 you have the right to message me and00:03:12.840 tell me that I was wrong please listen00:03:15.280 to this episode really really I mean00:03:17.120 that from the bottom of my heart and00:03:18.560 just to make sure you do throughout this00:03:20.120 episode there's going to be these popups00:03:21.720 if you collect eight of these codes that00:03:23.560 are going to pop up on the screen and00:03:25.080 put them in the document link below00:03:26.959 you'll unlock something very special00:03:28.560 some additional content please listen to00:03:30.720 this00:03:34.959 episode Dr Anna00:03:37.439 lmy you wrote one of the most iconic00:03:39.959 well-known books about dopamine which00:03:43.040 propelled the subject matter of dopamine00:03:44.840 into the public00:03:45.959 Consciousness but I guess the most00:03:47.920 important question I should ask you00:03:50.360 is why does dopamine matter ah good00:03:54.680 question good good place to start I mean00:03:57.760 dopamine matters because it00:04:00.319 fundamental to our survival right so00:04:03.159 it's the chemical that we make in our00:04:04.760 brain that tells us this is something we00:04:07.400 should approach explore investigate so00:04:10.879 it's it's really almost the survival00:04:13.120 chemical so what is dopamine if you had00:04:15.360 to explain it to a 10-year-old how would00:04:17.160 you go about explaining it so dopamine00:04:19.478 is a chemical that we make in our brain00:04:23.240 um it has many different functions but00:04:27.080 one of its most important functions is00:04:29.479 that it helps us experience pleasure00:04:32.919 reward and00:04:34.800 motivation um it may be even more00:04:37.000 important for the motivation to do00:04:39.400 things than it is for the pleasure00:04:41.199 itself so for example there's a very00:04:43.840 famous experiment in which rats were00:04:46.199 engineered to have no dopamine in the00:04:49.160 brain's reward pathway and the00:04:51.360 scientists discovered that if they put00:04:53.479 food in the rat's mouth the rat would00:04:55.280 eat the food would seem to get some00:04:57.360 pleasure from the food if you can deter00:04:59.919 that from watching a rat eat which I00:05:01.919 think they felt like they could uh but00:05:04.039 if you put the food even a body length00:05:06.280 away the rat will starve to death the00:05:09.560 idea being that without dopamine we're00:05:12.479 not motivated to seek out the things00:05:15.400 that we need for our basic survival00:05:18.080 that's crazy so you get a rat you put00:05:20.440 the food an inch from its mouth and it00:05:24.039 will starve to death because it doesn't00:05:25.520 have dopamine the dopamine required to00:05:27.280 just reach out and eat yeah essentially00:05:29.800 maybe it's not an inch maybe it's a00:05:31.120 little more than an inch but the idea00:05:33.160 being that dopamine is necessary to be00:05:36.680 motivated to do the work to get the00:05:39.880 thing that we need and having an00:05:43.400 understanding of dopamine how might that00:05:45.840 improve my life having a basic00:05:48.479 understanding of how dopamine Works how00:05:51.360 we process Pleasure and Pain and also00:05:54.639 what happens with dopamine as we go from00:05:57.240 adaptive recreational use to Mal00:05:59.639 adaptive addictive use is something that00:06:02.560 is really useful especially for those of00:06:04.720 us living in the modern world where now00:06:07.240 we're exposed to so many reinforcing00:06:09.599 substances and behaviors that we've all00:06:12.000 become vulnerable to the problem of00:06:13.800 addiction and what are the biggest00:06:15.680 misconceptions of on the subject of00:06:17.479 dopamine because it's kind of thrown00:06:19.039 around in society I see it in my group00:06:20.840 chats people saying I need more dopamine00:06:22.840 or whatever or you know that person just00:06:24.960 craves dopamine what what are the00:06:26.720 biggest misconceptions you've come00:06:28.000 across the main miscon conception is00:06:30.199 that somehow we can get addicted to00:06:32.319 dopamine we're not getting addicted to00:06:34.680 dopamine itself dopamine is neither good00:06:37.240 nor bad it's a signal to tell us whether00:06:41.479 or not something that we're doing is00:06:44.120 potentially useful for our survival and00:06:47.120 also it's related to what we predicted00:06:51.360 about how rewarding or pleasurable00:06:53.759 something would be and so it's really um00:06:56.800 you know I sort of sometimes I joke it's00:06:58.360 like the um reward theory of relativity00:07:02.319 DOP mean is in the sense that Pleasure00:07:04.560 and Pain really are truly relative to00:07:07.199 one another and so dopamine gives us00:07:09.680 information about where we are in that00:07:12.280 relativity scale between Pleasure and00:07:14.360 Pain and when you say relative you mean00:07:16.440 I mean it's it's quite fitting for00:07:18.000 anyone that can't see we have a a set of00:07:19.960 scales on the table and scales are00:07:22.319 relative to each other because if you00:07:23.560 pour in one end the other end goes up00:07:26.000 and if you pour in the other end the00:07:27.000 other end goes up and this end goes down00:07:29.240 and when you say relative that's what00:07:30.800 you're describing right yes that's what00:07:32.680 that's what I'm describing yes okay and00:07:35.360 what activities that I do every day have00:07:38.160 an impact on my00:07:39.639 dopamine well probably almost everything00:07:43.479 you know in some ways um I mean every00:07:45.919 time we are doing something that's00:07:48.599 pleasurable reinforcing rewarding that00:07:52.000 will affect dope mean it's it's really00:07:54.240 the primary signal that lets us know00:07:57.080 that this thing is potentially important00:07:59.560 for our survival as I mentioned um but00:08:02.440 you know even um aversive stimuli can00:08:06.680 trigger dopamine what's oh something00:08:09.319 that's painful or not pleasurable00:08:11.159 dopamine gets involved in in that um00:08:14.159 equation anything that's novel or new is00:08:17.960 something that triggers our dopamine in00:08:20.560 in our reward pathway dopamine is00:08:23.039 fundamental for movement so not just00:08:26.120 pleasure and reward but also movement so00:08:28.800 for example Parkinson's disease which is00:08:31.560 a disease related to stiffness and00:08:34.320 Tremor is caused by a depletion of00:08:37.719 dopamine in a part of the brain called00:08:39.640 the substantia [ __ ] and as dopamine00:08:42.479 gets depleted in that part of the brain00:08:44.680 people lose the ability to move their00:08:47.240 bodies and it's probably no coincidence00:08:50.360 that the same neurotransmitter that is00:08:52.120 so important for pleasure reward00:08:54.200 motivation is also really important for00:08:56.680 movement because most organisms have to00:08:59.440 to locomote toward the object of their00:09:02.200 desire we want that thing we have to00:09:04.680 exert effort right we have to put in the00:09:06.959 work to go get it but in the world today00:09:09.680 we really don't have to do that right we00:09:11.880 can swipe right we can swipe left and00:09:13.959 all of a sudden it magically appears at00:09:16.079 the touch of a finger and that's very00:09:18.720 confusing for our brains because that's00:09:20.680 not how we evolved we really evolved for00:09:23.399 for having to do quite a bit of upfront00:09:26.240 work for a tiny little bit of reward00:09:29.920 I just want to before we move on talk00:09:32.079 about this point you said because I00:09:33.320 think it's quite foundational to00:09:34.600 everything we're going to talk about00:09:35.680 about dopamine being relative to pain00:09:38.200 and I have this set of scales in front00:09:39.839 of me and here I have some chemicals00:09:43.480 that are likely to produce dopamine in00:09:46.120 my brain I believe right so alcohol I00:09:49.040 have some rum I have some whiskey I have00:09:51.120 some vodka and can you explain to me00:09:53.839 using this rum whiskey and vodka how00:09:56.760 dopamine is relative to pain and what00:09:59.519 going on in my brain sure okay I'll00:10:01.360 slide this over to you oh00:10:03.320 okay so one of the most exciting00:10:06.839 findings in Neuroscience in the past 7500:10:09.560 years is that Pleasure and Pain are00:10:12.160 collocated in the brain so the same00:10:14.880 parts of the brain that process pleasure00:10:17.000 also process pain and in a very simple00:10:20.600 reductionist kind of way they work like00:10:23.160 opposite sides of a balance so imagine00:10:26.720 that deep in your brain's reward pathway00:10:29.040 which is is another exciting Discovery00:10:31.440 right that there's this dedicated reward00:10:33.120 pathway of the brain that consists00:10:35.279 broadly speaking of the prefrontal CeX00:10:37.680 which is this large gray matter area00:10:39.720 right behind our foreheads that's so00:10:41.399 important for future planning for00:10:43.680 delayed gratification for appreciating00:10:45.920 future consequences you might think of00:10:48.160 it as like the brakes on the car if00:10:50.200 we're going to analogize to to a to an00:10:52.839 engine and then deep you know in the00:10:55.880 brain we've got what we call the limic00:10:58.240 areas or the emotion brain and there you00:11:01.079 have the nucleus accumbens and the00:11:02.880 vental tegmental area that are rich in00:11:06.240 dopamine releasing neurons right and00:11:09.200 they act like the accelerator on the car00:11:11.639 so when you've got a healthy functioning00:11:13.760 brain you've got enough accelerator but00:11:17.240 not too much right so enough dop Meine00:11:19.200 being released but not too much and00:11:20.680 youve got a healthy prefrontal cortex00:11:23.079 putting the brakes on that dopamine00:11:25.560 release when people um become addicted00:11:29.680 there's either a problem with the brakes00:11:32.600 the prefrontal cortex or the accelerator00:11:35.120 the nucleus accumbens and vental00:11:36.600 tegmental area or both right what we're00:11:39.800 finding is that there's actually a00:11:42.720 disconnect so there are large neuronal00:11:45.160 circuits and Pathways between those deep00:11:47.440 lyic structures and the prefrontal00:11:48.920 cortex that literally get severed or00:11:51.320 disconnected when people become addicted00:11:54.560 as we think about Pleasure and Pain00:11:57.240 being collocated in the same parts of00:11:58.880 the brain working like opposite sides of00:12:00.920 the00:12:01.920 balance in order to understand what00:12:04.360 happens in the addicted brain is to00:12:06.279 appreciate that there are fundamental00:12:08.480 rules governing this balance and one of00:12:11.360 the most important rules is is that the00:12:13.279 balance wants to remain level it does00:12:15.959 not want to be tilted very long to the00:12:17.760 side of either pleasure or pain and in00:12:20.920 fact what our brain does is first tilt00:12:22.839 an equal and opposite amount to whatever00:12:25.519 the initial stimulus is so I'm going to00:12:27.519 try to illustrate that here so let's say00:12:28.959 our00:12:29.680 initial stimulus is alcohol now alcohol00:12:32.800 Works through its own chemical pathway00:12:35.079 it works on our endogenous opioid system00:12:37.440 the opioids that we make we have00:12:39.000 receptors for opioids in our brains it00:12:41.199 works on our endogenous Gaba system00:12:43.240 which is our calming00:12:44.920 neurotransmitter and at the end of the00:12:46.839 day it releases dopamine in the reward00:12:49.519 pathway so any potentially addictive00:12:52.199 substance will release dopamine in the00:12:54.399 reward pathway the more that's released00:12:57.360 and the faster that's released in a00:12:59.600 given individual the more likely that00:13:01.959 substance is to be00:13:03.519 addictive now another important concept00:13:06.240 here is what we call drug of choice00:13:08.000 which is to say what releases a lot of00:13:10.399 dopamine in your brain may not release a00:13:13.079 lot of dopamine in my brain and vice00:13:14.760 versa right which is this idea that00:13:16.800 people have predictions to different00:13:18.639 kinds of drugs and by the way people can00:13:20.600 get addicted to behaviors too I should00:13:22.680 emphasize that when you say drug of00:13:25.440 choice you mean the brain has a00:13:28.040 particular sensitivity to that drug in00:13:31.120 terms of dopamine yes okay the more00:13:34.279 dopamine that's released the faster that00:13:36.079 it's released the more likely that drug00:13:38.000 is to be addictive for a given00:13:39.639 individual so you're holding some00:13:41.079 whiskey there I'm holding some whiskey00:13:42.839 there could be a brain that is very00:13:44.600 sensitive to Whiskey and there could be00:13:46.760 a different brain that you could pull00:13:48.320 all the whiskey and you like and the00:13:49.720 dopamine response is sort of limited00:13:52.759 exactly okay and for many of my patients00:13:56.519 who become addicted to alcohol they will00:13:58.759 tell you that from the first moment they00:14:01.040 had alcohol they knew they were either00:14:03.480 in trouble or had met their best friend00:14:05.720 or some combination it was a very potent00:14:09.040 experience for them all right so let's00:14:11.680 let's go ahead and put this on the00:14:13.160 pleasure side of the00:14:14.680 balance dopamine is being released but00:14:16.920 no sooner has that happened then my00:14:19.000 brain will work very hard to restore a00:14:22.160 level balance and by the way a level00:14:24.160 balance is what neuroscientists call00:14:26.720 homeostasis okay and one of the00:14:29.120 overarching physiologic drives for all00:14:31.160 living organisms is to return to00:14:32.959 homeostasis homeostasis is that00:14:35.360 parameter of what's often called called00:14:38.440 affordances or states of being that are00:14:41.600 adaptive and healthy for the organism00:14:43.839 for example like we have a certain00:14:45.920 homeostasis of body temperature and if00:14:47.920 we go much too much beyond that either00:14:50.959 too high or too low we will disintegrate00:14:53.120 and die right so homeostasis is that00:14:55.639 that states of being that are compatible00:14:58.480 with existence00:14:59.720 and and potentially advantageous too00:15:01.560 sort of Baseline level that's right yeah00:15:04.079 Baseline level and by the way we're00:15:05.360 always releasing dopamine at a kind of00:15:07.040 tonic Baseline level in our brains I00:15:08.880 sometimes think of it as the heartbeat00:15:10.040 of the brain so what's happened here for00:15:11.920 people that can't see is you've poured a00:15:13.199 little bit of whiskey into one end of00:15:14.519 the scale the pleasure side of the scale00:15:17.040 and the other side of the scale has00:15:18.680 risen because now there's whiskey um in00:15:21.120 the the pleasure side which I guess is00:15:22.720 released dopamine exactly so now now we'00:15:25.519 released dopamine in the reward pathway00:15:27.880 okay because the pain side went up does00:15:29.920 that mean there's now less pain in the00:15:31.480 brain well I think you know again this00:15:34.040 is a metaphor it's an oversimplification00:15:36.560 the idea here is just when we press on00:15:38.920 the pleasure side we're releasing00:15:40.839 dopamine in the reward pathway and00:15:42.279 experiencing pleasure okay okay but no00:15:45.240 sooner has that happened then our brain00:15:47.199 will try to compensate or adapt to00:15:50.600 increased dopamine firing by down00:15:52.959 regulating dopamine transmission for00:15:54.880 example by involuting post synaptic00:15:57.560 dopamine receptors that mean okay okay00:16:00.759 so our brain is a bunch of wires you00:16:04.240 know um that conduct these electrical00:16:06.639 signals and and these long spindly cells00:16:09.120 are called neurons and the thing about00:16:11.199 neurons is that they don't actually00:16:13.120 touch end to end there's a little Gap or00:16:15.519 space between them and that Gap is00:16:17.000 called the synapse and that Gap or00:16:20.199 synapse is bridged by what we call00:16:21.880 neurotransmitters and dopamine is one of00:16:23.800 those neurotransmitters okay and when00:16:27.120 the pre synaptic neuron pulses and00:16:29.759 releases dopamine it crosses the synapse00:16:32.759 and binds to a receptor on the post00:16:35.360 synaptic neuron which either continues00:16:38.000 or aborts that electrical signal does00:16:40.160 that make sense yes okay so one of the00:16:42.920 ways that our brain can decrease the00:16:46.040 effects of dopamine decrease dopamine00:16:48.160 transmission is by involuting or taking00:16:51.480 inside the neuron the post synaptic00:16:54.399 receptor that way when dopamine is00:16:56.360 released it has nowhere to bind oh okay00:16:58.480 so it's like removing the docking00:17:00.079 station exactly very good it's removing00:17:02.800 the docking station so essentially00:17:04.480 getting back to our scale we've we've00:17:06.480 you know ingested alcohol we've00:17:08.199 increased dopamine firing in the reward00:17:10.280 pathway but remember our pleasure pain00:17:12.319 balance wants to return to the level00:17:14.400 position level with the ground00:17:16.679 homeostasis so it's going to decrease00:17:19.160 dopamine transmission by for example00:17:21.520 involuting those post synaptic dopamine00:17:24.319 receptors but one thing about the brain00:17:27.079 in its process of trying to get back to00:17:29.799 homeostasis and again I like to think of00:17:31.760 this neuro adaptation process as these00:17:33.760 Gremlins hopping on the pain side of the00:17:36.400 balance to bring it level again you00:17:38.039 don't have Gremlins here you have these00:17:39.360 little rocks but let's go ahead and put00:17:41.480 a rock on the pain side of the balance00:17:43.240 and the these rocks are are friends00:17:45.880 right their job is to level the balance00:17:47.880 because remember we got to go back to00:17:48.799 homeostasis I'm going to put a rock on00:17:50.600 and you're going to see oh my gosh it00:17:53.000 overshot right it now I've got it00:17:55.880 pressed down on the the pain side of the00:17:57.840 balance but that's exactly what happens00:18:00.480 in our brains in this process of neuro00:18:02.559 adaptation those Gremlins hopping on the00:18:04.960 pain side of the balance don't get off00:18:07.120 as soon as the balance is level they00:18:08.720 stay on until we're tilted and equal an00:18:11.360 opposite amount so is that what a00:18:13.080 hangover is or a cown as they would say00:18:16.360 when people take drugs they say I have a00:18:18.120 come down exactly that's exactly what it00:18:21.520 is that's the hangover the come down the00:18:23.760 Blue Monday or on a much smaller scale00:18:26.799 just that moment of craving right that00:18:29.080 moment of wanting to have one more shot00:18:31.960 right why does it overshoot why can't it00:18:33.720 just perfectly hit homeostasis such a00:18:36.360 great question because then we'd feel00:18:38.159 fine yeah why did Mother Nature do that00:18:40.400 to us so cruel right yeah okay I'm going00:18:45.640 to tell you an evolutionary just so00:18:47.480 story what we mean by that is we don't00:18:49.320 really know why you know this mechanism00:18:51.880 exists but from an evolutionary00:18:54.520 perspective if you're living in a world00:18:56.720 of scarcity and everpresent danger this00:19:00.039 is the perfect mechanism to make sure00:19:03.200 that we're never satisfied with what we00:19:05.520 have that we're always wanting more it's00:19:08.640 made us the ultimate00:19:10.480 Seekers okay because immediately after00:19:12.880 getting something I'm now feeling a lack00:19:15.720 of pleasure and I'm at a deficit you00:19:17.960 know on the pain side of the scale which00:19:19.760 means that I'm going to go seeking out00:19:21.400 more dopamine and in a world where00:19:23.960 everything is quite scarce that could00:19:25.799 mean going on another 4-Hour hunt the00:19:27.960 next day to go killer gazelle or00:19:29.480 something perfect you got yeah you got00:19:31.960 it interesting yeah okay so that's going00:19:34.960 to motivate me because this get so Jesus00:19:39.000 people that have hangovers don't seem00:19:40.320 very00:19:41.440 motivated right so now that's a so why00:19:44.240 is that right it's because alcohol is a00:19:49.600 product of human00:19:51.960 engineering that releases so much00:19:54.640 dopamine all at once in the reward00:19:56.880 pathway that our brains are reeling to00:20:00.240 compensate right we we really weren't00:20:03.080 evolved for this much pleasure with this00:20:06.720 much easy access as you said yourself we00:20:09.240 were really evolved for to have to do00:20:12.200 quite a lot of work upfront and to be00:20:15.039 hungry and to be lonely and to be tired00:20:17.600 and then get a little bit of reward that00:20:20.039 would then bring us back up to00:20:22.440 homostasis so really we were evolved to00:20:25.159 be pressing on the pain side of the00:20:26.760 balance in our effort to find pleasure00:20:29.440 and then when we find it that little bit00:20:31.720 of food or clothing or shelter or a mate00:20:34.320 would bring us back to the level00:20:35.840 position does that makes sense yeah so00:20:37.520 you're you're telling me essentially00:20:38.679 that we're all wired to be addicted00:20:42.679 because if this is how our brain works00:20:44.400 in a world it's designed to seek out00:20:48.039 more dopamine but the problem we have00:20:50.000 now is we have all the synthetic00:20:51.600 dopamine effectively like this so00:20:53.840 synthetic chemicals and synthetic things00:20:55.880 and you know an Internet that is wiring00:20:58.679 us to give us so much dopamine so easily00:21:01.640 that that means that our brains are00:21:02.760 effectively like mismatched to the world00:21:05.320 that we live in and therefore wired to00:21:06.760 be addicted yeah I think you actually00:21:08.039 said that I found a quote you said in an00:21:10.440 interview where you said we all wired to00:21:12.880 be addicted and if you're not addicted00:21:14.440 yet it's right around the corner right00:21:17.120 coming to a website near you yes I I00:21:19.760 guess I would I would qualify that a00:21:21.840 little bit by saying we're wired for00:21:24.480 survival in a world of scarcity that's00:21:27.919 not the world live in now we live in a00:21:29.679 world of overwhelming overabundance and00:21:32.320 so there is a mismatch between this00:21:34.480 ancient wiring that has us relentlessly00:21:36.679 pursuing pleasure in order to survive00:21:40.279 and a world that's so infused with00:21:42.600 pleasure and so many rewarding stimuli00:21:44.960 that now we're overwhelming our reward00:21:47.120 system and our brains are reeling in00:21:49.360 response to try to compensate so what00:21:51.679 happens to this scale then in such a00:21:53.559 world where I can get a big hit of00:21:55.320 dopamine all the time using some of00:21:57.600 these synthetic things or the internet00:21:59.279 or pornography or whatever else what's00:22:01.120 going on with this scale over and over00:22:02.679 again okay great so let me get there let00:22:04.960 me first say though that remember after00:22:07.559 we do something that's highly00:22:09.279 pleasurable our brain compensates with00:22:11.480 neuro adaptation tilting an equal and00:22:13.720 opposite amount to the side of pain and00:22:16.480 then restoring our balance back to the00:22:19.440 level position right or what we call00:22:21.400 homeostasis so this doesn't last forever00:22:23.919 right it's to pleasure then it's to pain00:22:26.240 then it's back to the level position but00:22:28.720 if we continue to consume our drug of00:22:31.240 choice over days to weeks to months to00:22:34.120 years and we add in a whole bunch of00:22:36.760 other drugs and now we're consuming you00:22:40.039 know pornography and smoking pot and00:22:43.120 eating um donuts and you know you name00:22:47.520 it all at the same time then essentially00:22:50.559 what happens is those Gremlins on the00:22:53.559 pain side of the balance end up camped00:22:56.480 out there for anyone that see she put00:22:59.120 all of the Rocks into the pain side to00:23:01.279 represent All Of The Addictive behaviors00:23:03.279 that this individual has now taken on00:23:06.320 right and now we've entered addicted00:23:10.039 brain by which I mean that we've changed00:23:12.919 our honic or Joy set point to the side00:23:17.440 of pain now we need more and more of our00:23:21.240 drug in more potent forms not to get00:23:24.520 high and feel good but just to level the00:23:28.000 balance feel normal and this is not00:23:29.720 going to be enough to level the balance00:23:31.720 I would have to like keep filling this00:23:34.200 much more than this container can hold00:23:36.600 and that would be in Pursuit really of00:23:38.480 just trying to level that balance so00:23:40.720 that we can feel normal and when we're00:23:42.200 not using we're walking around with a00:23:44.559 balance tilted toward the side of pain00:23:47.120 experiencing the universal symptoms of00:23:49.520 withdrawal from any addictive substance00:23:52.159 or behavior which are anxiety00:23:55.080 irritability insomnia depression and00:23:58.120 crav00:23:59.360 so if I managed to get enough vodka00:24:01.799 whiskey rum and pour it into the00:24:03.840 pleasure side of the scale now that all00:24:05.360 the rocks are in the pain side of the00:24:06.720 scale I managed to outweigh00:24:09.120 it it would it would what would then00:24:11.960 happen more rocks more rocks would be00:24:14.240 added yes more so momentarily yeah I00:24:17.640 would maybe be in a little bit of00:24:19.279 pleasure yes but then my brain would00:24:21.000 remove those docking stations again00:24:22.679 remove more of them and more rocks would00:24:24.360 go in and I'd slam00:24:26.000 down on the pain side again which means00:24:28.399 I need more alcohol to try and get up to00:24:30.799 pleasure SL okay so really you want to00:24:33.679 you want to like dopamine fast you need00:24:37.440 you need to just balance this and this00:24:39.080 is so difficult because of the world we00:24:40.480 live in it's almost it's it's it's funny00:24:42.880 enough because this little scales00:24:44.559 experiment um analogy here has given me00:24:46.960 a huge amount of empathy for people that00:24:48.159 are addicts oh gosh I'm so glad you said00:24:50.520 that because I think that is the key to00:24:53.799 empathy for the disease of addiction as00:24:56.520 well as for people with the disease00:24:57.919 having empathy for themselves is00:25:00.399 recognizing that on some level it it's00:25:04.799 it's out of their control right because00:25:07.120 when we are tilted to the side of pain00:25:09.559 the overwhelming drive to restore a00:25:12.559 level balance or restore homeostasis as00:25:14.840 quickly as possible overwhelms any other00:25:18.000 rational thought about the consequences00:25:20.320 of my drug use right it's just like get00:25:22.799 back to the level position because if I00:25:25.240 do that I'll at least feel temporarily00:25:27.559 better00:25:29.399 one of the things this analogy also00:25:31.520 highlights for me is that people who are00:25:34.399 addicted aren't trying to self harm00:25:37.720 right and this is kind of the prevailing00:25:39.679 narrative that if you're like why would00:25:41.880 you do that to yourself right whereas00:25:43.720 when I look at this analogy I go00:25:45.480 actually what they're trying to do is00:25:47.840 to deal with pain and we're all trying00:25:50.440 to find ways to deal with our pain and00:25:53.240 but in this analogy what ultimately00:25:54.799 happens and I guess is what's happening00:25:56.240 with addicts is the way they're choosing00:25:58.000 to deal with their pain is becoming00:26:00.399 self-destructive and that's creating00:26:01.919 more pain right and it's this vicious00:26:04.080 downward cycle yes and I think that sort00:26:05.960 of reframing of what's going on there is00:26:07.600 really critical because again it begets00:26:09.159 more empathy absolutely I agree with you00:26:12.559 and and I think you know we this this00:26:15.480 metaphor it makes an assumption that we00:26:18.480 all start with a pleasure pain balance00:26:20.000 that's level with the ground but00:26:21.440 actually that's probably not true right00:26:24.399 some people at Baseline may actually be00:26:26.919 more depressed or more anxious or may00:26:29.080 have had life experiences that sets them00:26:31.360 up for a kind of chronic stress reaction00:26:34.760 and we know that people with00:26:35.919 co-occurring psychiatric disorders for00:26:37.799 example are at increased risk of00:26:39.799 developing addiction probably because00:26:41.559 they're reaching for that substance to00:26:43.960 self medicate their psychiatric problem00:26:47.600 the the issue with that is that it's not00:26:50.320 medicinal right it's not healing00:26:53.159 although in the short term substances00:26:56.159 can help with those kinds of feelings00:26:58.240 feelings of psychological and physical00:27:00.720 pain over time because of the way the00:27:03.760 brain adapts as we've00:27:06.320 discussed substances and other addictive00:27:09.200 behaviors just make psychiatric problems00:27:11.600 worse right as we drive ourselves00:27:13.880 further into the the kind of uh you know00:27:16.679 the pain side of the balance so is this00:27:18.520 why trauma often leads to addictive00:27:20.440 behaviors because the trauma has caused00:27:23.200 a a pain a stress and we're searching00:27:26.720 for ways to00:27:29.200 medicate that pain or stress yeah to00:27:31.279 numb ourselves to not be present in our00:27:33.640 reality and have to deal with what's00:27:35.559 going on there is dopamine what role is00:27:37.880 dopamine playing in it's all the same00:27:39.760 dopamine00:27:41.039 originally was to help us find those00:27:43.519 things that we need to survive food00:27:46.039 clothing shelter a mate we call those00:27:48.559 Natural Rewards but00:27:51.760 today that same reward pathway that00:27:54.720 relies on dopamine has been hijacked by00:27:57.440 all of these00:27:58.640 artificial rewards that our brain00:28:01.600 confuses as necessary for survival which00:28:05.080 is why people with severe addiction will00:28:07.840 be willing to lose you know not00:28:10.159 consciously but unconsciously their00:28:12.840 loved ones their homes their jobs00:28:15.480 everything they have in pursuit of their00:28:17.159 drug of choice it's because their brain00:28:19.399 has been hijacked and they now confuse00:28:23.080 the drug as necessary for survival the00:28:26.240 other thing about drugs is that they're00:28:28.399 incredibly potent they release a lot of00:28:30.440 dopamine all at once which again is00:28:32.919 confusing for our brain Natural Rewards00:28:36.519 require upfront effort where we do a lot00:28:38.720 of work and then we get a little bit of00:28:41.399 dopamine and that's what our brains00:28:43.200 evolved for I mean I can that makes00:28:45.399 sense in my own life when I'm most00:28:47.919 stressed or most challenged by something00:28:50.679 professionally is when I I immediately00:28:52.880 notice that my diet goes out the window00:28:54.840 I start eating things that are bad I00:28:56.279 actually stop going to the gym as much00:28:58.640 um and it's it be can form a bit of a00:29:01.320 downward spiral can't it I guess as00:29:03.080 we've kind of seen from the dopamine00:29:04.679 scale um can I can I get back to that00:29:07.760 your question though about trauma and00:29:09.440 stress so um there's a very series00:29:13.279 there's a very interesting series of00:29:14.840 experiments in rodents mice and rats00:29:18.960 where they first of all rodents very00:29:22.760 easily get addicted to cocaine they will00:29:25.279 press a lever for cocaine until00:29:27.440 exhaustion or death but if that cocaine00:29:31.039 is then taken away that behavior will00:29:34.720 extinguish which means that the mice00:29:37.200 will eventually just stop pressing the00:29:38.840 lever right because they're not getting00:29:40.120 any cocaine totally makes sense and then00:29:42.240 they'll go off and do something else in00:29:43.640 the cage but if they're then exposed to00:29:46.919 a very painful foot shock right so a00:29:50.159 very extreme physical pain which you00:29:52.159 could equate to a serious life stressor00:29:55.559 the first thing the rat will do is run00:29:58.320 over to the lever and start pressing for00:30:02.919 cocaine which tells us that once our00:30:06.120 brain has discovered a drug that00:30:08.679 releases a lot of dopamine in our reward00:30:12.279 pathway even after we stop using that00:30:15.480 drug if we are exposed to an extreme00:30:20.360 stressor our brain will tell us00:30:23.080 immediately go and do that thing that00:30:25.799 gives us a lot of dopamine because you00:30:28.000 are under stress and I need to be00:30:30.279 relieved of stress does that make sense00:30:32.080 makes perfect sense yeah so if you00:30:33.799 especially so if you discover your drug00:30:35.159 of choice when you're younger and it's00:30:36.799 food or it's pornography or if it's I00:30:39.840 don't know anything that really made you00:30:41.679 feel good for a moment a moment of00:30:43.640 pleasure that will always become in the00:30:46.519 case of these rodent00:30:48.960 experiments the thing you run back to00:30:51.519 when life gets hard right and we see00:30:54.039 that again and again in people in00:30:56.159 sustained recovery from addtion that00:30:59.600 when they are under stress that is a00:31:03.639 trigger potentially for them to relapse00:31:06.200 so they have to be really thoughtful in00:31:08.000 their lives for number one trying to00:31:10.039 avoid stressful situations and and by00:31:12.559 the way stress can come in many00:31:14.639 different forms there's a great acronym00:31:16.240 in in alcoholic synonymous called halt00:31:19.039 hungry angry lonely tired those kinds of00:31:23.880 stressors everyday stressors which we00:31:26.279 all experience hungry angry lonely tired00:31:29.480 can trigger us to want to use so people00:31:31.960 in recovery have to be really thoughtful00:31:33.760 about not getting too hungry not getting00:31:35.880 too angry not getting too lonely and not00:31:38.600 getting too tired at the end of this00:31:40.440 conversation I want to go through all of00:31:41.519 the sort of practical solutions that00:31:43.360 someone struggling with an addiction to00:31:44.760 social media pornography food whatever00:31:47.880 it might be um Can Implement to try and00:31:50.960 shift that cycle that they might be00:31:53.159 going through especially when they're00:31:54.519 halting hungry angry lonely or tired how00:31:57.399 often have you worked with addicts have00:31:59.320 you spent much time working with addicts00:32:00.840 directly oh my gosh yeah so that's the00:32:02.720 bulk of my career is working uh with00:32:05.679 people with all different kinds of00:32:07.000 addictions me an example of the most00:32:09.039 obscure the most I had a patient who was00:32:11.840 addicted to00:32:13.399 water I know hard hard to imagine you00:32:16.639 have to though understand her narrative00:32:19.480 so she had a very severe alcohol00:32:21.880 addiction she got into recovery from00:32:24.320 that addiction and gave up alcohol but00:32:26.919 she discovered that by drinking copious00:32:29.880 amounts of water she could become00:32:32.880 hyponic meaning that she could lower the00:32:36.360 sodium levels in her bloodstream which00:32:38.159 would then lead her to become delirious00:32:40.600 and so in her desire to just be checked00:32:42.720 out she would do that she would she00:32:45.080 would drink a large amounts of water00:32:48.240 she's doing okay no sadly she's not um00:32:51.600 she she ended up taking her own life so00:32:54.240 that was very sad00:32:59.720 gosh in that situation was there was00:33:02.760 there a root cause of that behavior00:33:04.440 pattern further Upstream some kind of00:33:06.639 trauma or experience that had set this00:33:09.120 sort of cascade cascading set of issues00:33:11.240 off yeah you know I'm just speaking00:33:14.039 broadly um for for some patients with00:33:17.120 severe addiction trauma is a huge Factor00:33:21.480 um especially severe Early Childhood00:33:24.000 trauma but there are also many folks we00:33:27.399 see00:33:28.399 who have kind of great parents and have00:33:31.159 had happy childhoods and have great00:33:34.159 social networks and and work that they00:33:36.720 enjoy and yet they still become addicted00:33:40.240 and that's because we again we are wired00:33:44.600 to consume as much as possible of00:33:47.880 whatever releases dopamine in our brains00:33:50.120 to have survived Evolution to this date00:33:53.519 and yet we're living in this world where00:33:55.320 we have access to so many drug aied00:33:58.519 substances and behaviors that we've all00:34:00.760 become vulnerable to this problem and00:34:02.960 the reason I highlight this is because00:34:05.360 one of the things that I think has00:34:06.760 happened in the field of addiction00:34:08.359 medicine that maybe isn't the best is00:34:12.320 that often times patients themselves as00:34:14.879 well as their providers are digging00:34:17.040 really deep to find the trauma or the00:34:20.639 reason that someone has become addicted00:34:23.760 and I think that that's important to do00:34:25.800 in some cases but in in other other00:34:28.079 cases it can lead to kind of00:34:30.239 manufacturing trauma where there really00:34:32.280 isn't any furthermore I would say that00:34:35.199 when a person is in the throws of their00:34:37.119 addiction they're not going to be able00:34:39.560 to really do the complex emotional00:34:42.199 processing of their trauma while they're00:34:44.520 still using their drug of choice that00:34:46.719 they really need to get out of that00:34:48.440 Vortex of addiction and get into some00:34:50.560 degree of recovery before you would even00:34:53.159 want to go tackle some of those early00:34:55.560 traumatic experiences how many people do00:34:58.240 you think are struggling with some form00:34:59.680 of00:35:00.640 addiction well if you think of addiction00:35:02.920 as a spectrum disorder right there's00:35:04.800 mild moderate and severe um and there's00:35:08.200 I would even say a kind of a pre-00:35:09.680 addiction state where we're all sort of00:35:11.359 dabbling in compulsive overc consumption00:35:14.079 I would say the vast majority of us like00:35:16.760 90 probably00:35:19.200 95% have some degree of compulsive over00:35:22.599 consumption and you know if and when it00:35:25.320 tips over into what we would call00:35:26.920 addiction there's not a brain scan or a00:35:29.160 blood test to assess that it's not like00:35:31.040 you know switching a light a light00:35:32.520 switch and it's like oh yeah now you00:35:33.680 have addiction um it's not like that00:35:36.200 it's you know it's a gradual often a00:35:37.920 gradual and Insidious thing and we don't00:35:40.280 in fact have a biological measurement of00:35:42.960 addiction we Bas it on what we call00:35:45.320 phenomenology which is patterns of00:35:47.200 behavior that re repeat themselves00:35:49.079 across time and broadly speaking the00:35:52.319 definition of addiction is the continued00:35:54.440 compulsive use of a substance or a00:35:57.079 behavior despite harm to self and or00:36:00.280 others and so you know that harm can be00:36:03.800 very subtle um or not right and it can00:36:07.560 be a judgment call interesting because00:36:10.839 we do throw the word Addiction around a00:36:12.400 lot in society but but really the most00:36:15.280 important part of that is to understand00:36:17.040 if it's harming yourself or someone else00:36:18.920 the behavior pattern yes that's right00:36:20.800 and to also recognize that we're not00:36:22.440 very good judges of that when we're00:36:24.160 chasing dopamine okay so we sometimes00:36:26.720 justify behaviors we have as being not00:36:29.119 harmful and it's fine and it's not00:36:30.480 impacting me at all and what do you mean00:36:32.240 exactly and we don't we're not very good00:36:34.079 at seeing true cause and effect honestly00:36:36.200 when it comes to these behaviors which00:36:38.240 is why often times people won't really00:36:40.319 see the harm until they've stopped using00:36:43.000 for a period of time in your book00:36:45.480 dopamine Nation you talk about an00:36:47.160 addiction that you had yes and it was00:36:49.160 really surprising to me because I would00:36:51.880 never have thought that being obsessed00:36:53.359 with erotic00:36:54.839 novels could be classified as an00:36:57.040 addiction00:36:59.839 what happened what was the behavior take00:37:01.440 me into that that phase of your life so00:37:04.400 I was in my early 40s um my kids were no00:37:08.200 longer little um I got a lot of my00:37:10.760 self-worth and identity from being a mom00:37:14.079 and my kids were sort of entering00:37:15.839 adolescence they were doing fine but00:37:18.160 they didn't need me as much um so I had00:37:20.880 kind of a grief reaction you know in00:37:22.560 response to that was trying to figure00:37:24.480 out you know how to navigate this next00:37:26.280 phase of my life I'd always been a00:37:28.640 reader and in particular a reader of00:37:30.640 novels um in my own way that was how as00:37:33.880 a child I self soothed was to escape00:37:36.240 into uh the Fantasy Life of novels um00:37:39.720 but I never had what what I would call a00:37:42.040 problem with it and then one day I heard00:37:44.880 another mother at school said that she00:37:46.640 was reading this great book it was00:37:48.160 called Twilight it was about these00:37:50.040 vampires and she was going on and on00:37:52.000 about it and I read it and I I can't00:37:53.960 tell you what it was but it was just00:37:55.400 like the the the key in my particular it00:37:57.880 was completely00:37:59.079 transporting it just released a lot of00:38:01.880 dope mean is all I can imagine in my00:38:03.720 brains reward pathway and so I read the00:38:06.119 whole series and then I read the series00:38:08.200 again and I read it again and of course00:38:10.440 by the third or fourth time it wasn't as00:38:13.000 you know reinforcing and I thought to00:38:14.839 myself I wonder if there are any more00:38:17.200 vampire romance novels and then for me00:38:20.240 the real Tipping Point was I got an00:38:22.079 e-reader I got a Kindle because what00:38:24.960 happened was I I even before I got the00:38:27.680 Kindle I started reading you know novels00:38:30.319 that I would say I would be slightly00:38:31.440 embarrassed to admit that I was reading00:38:33.640 like kind of bodice Ripper novels as00:38:36.280 time went on I I needed more and more00:38:39.319 like graphic kinds of descriptions in00:38:42.680 order to find it pleasurable and and by00:38:45.440 the way that's classic for the addiction00:38:48.880 narrative right where you start out with00:38:50.960 a little bit and it goes a long way and00:38:52.599 then over time you build up tolerance00:38:54.599 that's neuro adaptation the Gremlins00:38:57.560 pressing down on the pain side of00:38:58.720 balance now I need more of my drug in00:39:00.200 more potent forms to get the same effect00:39:02.760 gradually over time I started um reading00:39:06.280 you know more and more sort of graphic00:39:09.079 erotic sexualized versions of this novel00:39:12.560 and I would I was embarrassed so I would00:39:14.520 hide that I was reading them and that00:39:16.119 gets into the whole double life of00:39:17.640 addiction where now we're lying about00:39:19.720 our use we're we're using our drug over00:39:21.960 here but pretending like we're not so my00:39:24.319 kids or my husband would walk in the00:39:25.520 room and I would be you know hiding00:39:27.760 behind another book one book behind00:39:30.079 another book so it looked like I was00:39:32.319 reading something you know I don't know00:39:34.520 more00:39:36.720 sophisticated and then the Tipping Point00:39:38.800 for me came really when I got a Kindle00:39:40.920 or an e-reader and then my reading was00:39:43.560 totally Anonymous I could read these00:39:45.280 books anywhere any time no one knew what00:39:47.359 I was reading and as soon as I finished00:39:49.760 one um I could read another one and I00:39:53.359 almost overnight became a chain reader00:39:55.640 like literally when I was n doing00:39:58.160 something else that I had to do I was00:40:00.560 reading romance novels one after another00:40:03.160 after another um which meant I was you00:40:06.000 know less present for my kids less00:40:08.079 present for my husband I would often00:40:10.119 stay up till 2: 3 4 in the morning on a00:40:12.560 week night reading romance novels have00:40:15.040 to get up two hours later go to work00:40:17.400 exhausted not able to be present for my00:40:19.640 patience not enjoying my work gradually00:40:22.200 getting more depressed more irritable00:40:24.040 more anxious more insomnia we went on on00:40:27.520 a a family vacation with an family00:40:29.960 friends of ours everybody together at00:40:31.520 this beach house all the kids playing I00:40:33.599 was like hiding in a room reading00:40:35.000 romance novels so and this is exactly00:40:37.839 what happens with addiction is that our00:40:40.160 Focus Narrows and the things that we00:40:43.640 used to enjoy are no longer pleasurable00:40:45.920 only this one thing has salience for us00:40:48.720 we plan our whole whole day around00:40:50.599 getting it using it hiding our use um00:40:54.920 and that's what happened to me00:40:58.599 it's so interesting because I was as you00:41:00.280 were talking about that I was thinking00:41:01.319 about all the behaviors that I have that00:41:04.280 are maybe isolating me or you know I00:41:08.680 just even things like spending a lot of00:41:10.599 time on the internet just watching video00:41:12.720 after video after video on YouTube or um00:41:17.160 those kinds of things or just like00:41:18.680 spending tons of time in my WhatsApp00:41:20.520 group chat talking like roasting my00:41:22.960 friends about nothing right how do you00:41:24.760 know if like this is it's cuz on end of00:41:27.560 the spectrum I could say okay well00:41:28.680 that's harming my relationship with00:41:31.240 people in the real world but00:41:34.920 it's helping making me feel good and00:41:38.280 it's you know maybe helping me in00:41:40.480 another department because I'm learning00:41:42.200 more about vampires or you know like so00:41:46.319 like you know because there's there00:41:47.760 might be net harm somewhere else but00:41:50.680 then an upside over here which and then00:41:52.760 I start rationalizing this Behavior like00:41:55.280 how' you just distinguish between these00:41:57.599 behaviors and know what's bad and what's00:41:59.240 good you know what it's really hard um00:42:03.560 these digital devices are powerful tools00:42:07.079 but also very potent drugs there's no00:42:09.880 doubt that digital media lights up the00:42:13.160 same reward pathway as drugs and alcohol00:42:16.119 these devices and platforms were00:42:18.000 designed to be addictive that is to keep00:42:20.200 us scrolling and tapping long beyond00:42:23.800 what we plan for or what we want or even00:42:26.760 what's pleasurable I think we can all00:42:28.839 relate to using this00:42:31.599 medium to a point where we don't even00:42:35.000 like it anymore and yet have difficulty00:42:37.400 getting ourselves off of it that really00:42:39.599 speaks to the inherently reinforcing and00:42:43.680 cognitively adherent nature of this00:42:46.760 medium it is a drug and so you know if00:42:51.319 and when and how we're crossing into00:42:53.359 addictive00:42:54.400 use I think we need to be very Vig00:42:58.280 about whether that's happened in our00:43:00.319 lives and one of the ways to do that is00:43:03.079 actually to try cutting out that00:43:05.319 particular digital medium that website00:43:08.720 or that behavior for a period of time00:43:11.720 long enough to experience withdrawal00:43:14.960 potentially reset reward Pathways and00:43:17.200 then re-evaluate because when we're in00:43:19.640 the behavior as you yourself noted it's00:43:22.880 very easy to rationalize oh I need to do00:43:25.720 this for work oh I need need to do this00:43:27.520 to stay in touch with my friends oh I'm00:43:29.000 learning so much from this right and all00:43:32.520 of that may have been true initially but00:43:35.359 may not be that true anymore and what I00:43:39.119 often point to is the subtler signs of00:43:41.960 addiction which are things like00:43:43.400 depression anxiety in attention insomnia00:43:47.839 restlessness these can be early signals00:43:51.079 for our consumption entering into that00:43:54.200 addiction range but us not realizing it00:43:57.400 because again we don't see cause and00:44:00.520 effect which is why doing an experiment00:44:03.520 like I did with my romance novels you00:44:06.800 know following in the footsteps of my00:44:09.000 patients and taking the advice I give00:44:11.040 them and I gave my romance novels up for00:44:15.000 30 days right just to see like okay I00:44:18.520 think this is a problematic Behavior can00:44:20.359 I give it up how will I feel and the00:44:23.640 very first day that I the very first 2400:44:26.839 hours hours that I did not read any00:44:29.319 romance novel any novel at all I was00:44:32.599 astounded at my level of anxiety00:44:36.119 restlessness and utter insomnia I had00:44:39.839 completely unlearned the art of putting00:44:42.119 myself to sleep without this digital00:44:46.079 narrative and that lasted a good 10 to00:44:48.559 14 days completely mapping on with the00:44:50.960 amount of time it takes typically to get00:44:53.280 out of acute withdrawal that is to say00:44:55.559 for those neuro adapt PA Gremlins to hop00:44:57.960 off the pain side of the balance and for00:44:59.880 homeostasis to to begin to be re00:45:03.240 restored um but by the time I got to00:45:05.839 weeks three and four I felt not just00:45:09.000 better than I had in the first two weeks00:45:10.640 but actually better than I had felt in a00:45:12.480 really long time I enjoyed my kids more00:45:16.079 I was more present for them I enjoyed my00:45:18.760 husband more my work seemed salian again00:45:21.079 I had started to think oh maybe I should00:45:22.800 do something else you know maybe maybe I00:45:25.720 you know this work I've been doing it a00:45:26.800 long long time I don't it's not that00:45:28.359 interesting anymore all of a sudden it00:45:30.720 was interesting again right so you see00:45:33.440 the relativity of that honic pathway and00:45:36.760 how when we're doing that behavior or00:45:38.599 substance that's so reinforcing that00:45:40.559 everything else loses its salience we00:45:42.960 can really00:45:44.559 misidentify what is causing our00:45:47.680 irritability anxiety insomnia until we00:45:51.000 stop that substance for long enough to00:45:53.559 see its impact on our lives how is it00:45:55.800 making you feel because I think a lot of00:45:58.400 a lot of people can't understand how you00:45:59.880 could get addicted to a book I'm sure00:46:03.559 some people understand that but but for00:46:04.920 me it's not something I've ever become00:46:07.079 addicted to so how how did it feel was00:46:09.359 it like exciting is it arousing is it00:46:13.160 somewhere in00:46:14.319 between I mean I think that romance00:46:17.319 novels are essentially socially00:46:19.800 sanctioned pornography for women okay00:46:22.319 and the medium is narrative and if00:46:24.480 you're a person for whom narrative is a00:46:26.359 powerful drug as it is for me a story a00:46:28.960 narrative a fiction um very potent since00:46:32.000 I was a child then you know it was a00:46:35.119 natural that that that would be the00:46:37.160 thing that I would get addicted to and00:46:39.000 basically just like we've hacked and00:46:41.800 bioengineered everything to make it more00:46:44.240 potent I mean people there's a formula00:46:46.400 for writing romance novels like if you00:46:48.599 take a physical copy if you go to a00:46:50.400 store and you pick up a romance novel00:46:52.319 and you literally physically open it to00:46:54.520 2third of the way through you will get00:46:56.559 to the climactic scene pun intended00:46:59.559 right it's it's like it's00:47:01.480 engineered I mean I got to a point where00:47:05.000 I wouldn't even read it read after I00:47:06.800 wouldn't finish the book I would go on00:47:08.720 to the next book just to get to the00:47:10.400 climax part and then you'd move yeah and00:47:12.000 I wouldn't even read the danum ma or00:47:13.720 like what happens to the characters I00:47:15.480 didn't care you didn't care about no and00:47:17.839 also I didn't I got to point where I00:47:19.079 didn't care about the quality of the00:47:20.240 writing or the depth of the car it00:47:22.240 didn't matter it was it was the drug it00:47:24.440 was that moment I was looking for and00:47:26.640 you know there are a lot of free books00:47:28.400 on Amazon some some of which are high00:47:30.400 quality and some of which are not but00:47:32.119 like you know any good drug dealer knows00:47:33.800 free samples that's the way you hook00:47:35.599 people I would search for these free00:47:37.440 samples and that's part of it too like00:47:39.000 the searching for the drug so the00:47:40.920 Working The Upfront work you do for the00:47:43.160 drug is part of the drug right it's all00:47:46.680 that you know the machinations and the00:47:48.760 hiding and the this and the that that00:47:51.000 gets to be part of like all of the00:47:53.160 rituals surrounding it as you were00:47:55.200 talking as well I thought about work and00:47:57.000 work addiction yes because you earlier00:47:59.680 used the term excessive consumption and00:48:02.480 when I think about work even my work I00:48:04.200 Think Jesus I excessively consume work I00:48:08.040 start so many bloody businesses and00:48:10.400 invest in so many things and if you look00:48:12.440 to that behavior objectively if you're00:48:13.920 like an alien looking down at me you'd00:48:15.280 go this guy's got a [ __ ] problem do00:48:17.480 you know what I mean you think you think00:48:18.960 that's funny joking you00:48:24.480 know I feel for you and it's funny cuz00:48:27.640 in society we then those people are00:48:29.760 reinforced we clap that's right we clap00:48:32.559 we got this guy's not sleeping he's00:48:33.880 working 18 hours a day clap clap clap00:48:36.800 give him a trophy an award name a thing00:48:39.280 after him or her or right you know um00:48:42.960 and it's just really interesting that00:48:44.440 that that addiction of work and you tell00:48:46.880 me if it is it can be an addiction it's00:48:48.559 certainly in the scale of one end being00:48:50.240 sort of consumption excessive00:48:52.000 consumption in the other hand being00:48:53.079 addiction it's on there somewhere people00:48:55.520 can get addicted to work00:48:57.280 and part of the reason is that we've00:48:59.000 drug aied work right when when I say00:49:01.040 drug aied what do I mean we've made it00:49:02.720 more potent and this is true for all all00:49:04.760 these drugs we've made them more potent00:49:06.760 more novel more Bountiful meaning00:49:09.319 there's more of it and more accessible00:49:11.640 so if we if we break that down with work00:49:13.400 how is work more potent well certain00:49:16.359 types of work are more reinforcing not00:49:18.520 all types of work so for example Works00:49:21.880 work White Collar work is often now00:49:24.960 associated with stock options and00:49:27.079 bonuses right um there's often like a00:49:29.920 social media aspect to it or maybe even00:49:32.880 a Fame aspect or as you point out those00:49:35.280 are our cultural Heroes right so you get00:49:37.640 all this you know agulation for being a00:49:41.200 workaholic and that also because we're00:49:43.599 such social creatures right and human00:49:45.359 connection stimulates dope mean that00:49:47.480 that also makes work more of a potent00:49:50.760 drug personal brand right so you're00:49:52.760 LinkedIn oh my God this person got a00:49:54.880 promotion we all clap we the likes the00:49:57.200 comments you're amazing the agulation00:49:58.720 the a as you said the awards the00:50:00.720 trophies and then you've got um the fact00:50:04.040 the fact of novelty so once we've00:50:06.640 exposed our brains enough times to a00:50:09.520 certain drug as I said we develop00:50:11.079 tolerance right and then we need more00:50:13.760 potent forms or novel forms one of the00:50:15.960 ways we overcome tolerance is by taking00:50:18.799 our drug and then changing it slightly00:50:20.760 like adding a little new molecule on00:50:23.280 this chemical right or on the Internet00:50:25.920 you know when we're searching videos we00:50:27.720 want something similar to what we liked00:50:29.359 before but just a little bit different00:50:31.240 and that's what the algorithm does00:50:32.480 automatically right it offers oh you00:50:34.359 should check this out oh how about this00:50:35.799 oh check that out right and that engages00:50:37.680 our treasure seeking function we're00:50:39.319 looking for that that novel thing but00:50:41.480 that's not too novel right it has to be00:50:43.640 in our category of things we like and I00:50:45.520 think for work we have that too like00:50:47.160 there are so many ways now that people00:50:48.680 can engage in their work and it's not00:50:50.240 all bad that it's novel but you know00:50:52.640 certain types of work it makes it very00:50:54.480 enticing then you have quantity00:50:57.160 right I mean work never ends there's00:50:59.160 like no natural stopping point for work00:51:01.880 you know you do a line of cocaine you00:51:04.079 run out of money you run out of cocaine00:51:05.920 you're done right but that's not true00:51:08.720 for work everywhere anytime and then00:51:11.799 that gets to00:51:12.880 accessibility one of the biggest risk00:51:14.960 factors for addiction to any drug or00:51:16.880 behavior is simple access we know that00:51:19.559 if you grow up in a neighborhood where00:51:21.000 drugs are sold on a street corner you're00:51:22.960 more likely to try them more likely to00:51:24.680 get addicted if you live in a world00:51:27.119 where you have access to work00:51:29.839 24/7 you're more likely to expose your00:51:32.960 brain to more work and more likely to00:51:34.440 get addicted to work again especially if00:51:36.119 it's got all those other reinforcing00:51:38.680 qualities this is probably in part why00:51:41.079 people quit their00:51:42.720 jobs you mean if they just get00:51:44.599 overwhelmed or it's it's partially why00:51:46.440 people can never quit but I think it's00:51:48.359 important to make a distinction between00:51:49.960 work that's reinforcing in those ways00:51:52.640 and then work that's completely not00:51:55.160 reinforcing yeah00:51:57.280 alienating mind-numbing work in which00:52:00.720 the the actual task is separated from00:52:03.359 the meaning of a task I mean they quit00:52:05.559 their jobs either in search of more00:52:07.000 dopamine so if I'm working in a job00:52:09.319 where I don't know maybe it once gave me00:52:11.040 dopamine and now it's become monotonous00:52:13.240 and the same right I I need to quit to00:52:15.640 go find but there's novelty for you00:52:17.559 that's right yeah and that's true people00:52:19.799 many people change jobs every two to00:52:21.599 three years I I recently read that the00:52:24.000 the average life of a business now is00:52:26.200 like 15 years whereas you know 50 years00:52:29.559 ago it was 50 years and there's all this00:52:32.160 turnover all this churn chasing novelty00:52:35.200 also you know I I do want to emphasize00:52:36.920 that people who are in work that's not00:52:38.920 like intrinsically rewarding but is the00:52:41.599 opposite kind of soul sucking that's00:52:44.319 also a risk factor for addiction because00:52:46.200 people just wait till the end of the day00:52:47.680 till they can go home and then use a00:52:50.079 drug to numb themselves from the stress00:52:52.720 of work so it's it's plausible that00:52:55.119 people who are in lower pleasure jobs00:52:57.760 are more likely to be overweight or00:52:59.720 addicted or dependent on alcohol yeah or00:53:02.640 simply opt out of the workforce as many00:53:04.599 young men are doing now in the United00:53:06.280 States and what we know from data that's00:53:08.640 been collected is many of them are00:53:09.960 playing video games right they've just00:53:11.720 completely opted out of the workforce I00:53:14.119 guess this in part explains why there's00:53:15.839 a drinking culture that's associated00:53:18.400 with people who are potentially lower00:53:21.200 class um because they're doing um00:53:25.559 potentially00:53:27.480 less pleasurable work00:53:30.400 and they're therefore they if we think00:53:33.160 about the scale that they would then end00:53:35.160 up in the pub after work you know maybe00:53:38.040 that's partially true but even people00:53:40.280 doing like doctors and lawyers they're00:53:42.520 are oh okay yeah equal rates of00:53:44.799 alcoholism among those groups I think00:53:47.839 what's happening there though is that00:53:49.280 the nature of the work is just so00:53:51.359 stressful whether it's white collar or00:53:53.160 blue collar that there's this kind of00:53:55.000 work hard play hard right I'm going to00:53:56.799 work all day and at the end of the day00:53:58.119 I'm going to reward myself so now you've00:53:59.680 got a pleasure pain balance that's going00:54:01.119 pleasure pain pleasure pain and and00:54:02.559 remember the biological definition of00:54:04.960 stress is any deviation from00:54:08.079 neutrality so that every time our brain00:54:11.440 has to work to restore a level balance00:54:14.079 we're actually triggering our stress00:54:15.960 response triggering our own adrenaline00:54:18.559 it's stressful to have to restore the00:54:21.200 balance from those extremes of Pleasure00:54:23.359 and Pain I read in um your book you were00:54:25.640 talking about how different behaviors00:54:27.559 and sort of chemicals and substances00:54:29.240 have different impacts and I was on page00:54:31.520 50 of dopamin nation in a study of mice00:54:34.359 sex increases the release of dopamine by00:54:36.359 100% And amphetamines which is like00:54:39.359 drugs right hardcore drugs increases it00:54:42.079 by 1,000% by this accounting one hit of00:54:45.400 a meth pipe is equal to 10 orgasms yes00:54:48.680 it's interesting to think about that the00:54:50.760 different behaviors we have and how00:54:52.440 they'll have a bigger impact on our00:54:53.839 dopamine is there like any in an in in00:54:58.160 typical order of things that are like00:54:59.920 extremely dopamine inducing and things00:55:01.680 that aren't what's it like the top and00:55:03.799 bottom of the list but in your view you00:55:06.599 know I really think that it depends on00:55:09.680 the person and we've got to look at drug00:55:11.920 of choice right I mean potent drugs like00:55:15.799 methamphetamine like opioids like00:55:17.839 alcohol like nicotine like cannabis um00:55:21.400 are are going to be very reinforcing for00:55:25.000 many people but not for all people and00:55:28.000 most people do have their one drug that00:55:30.200 they sort of prefer above all others so00:55:33.880 although generally speaking intoxicants00:55:36.039 release a lot of dopamine in the reward00:55:37.920 pathway um I think every person is going00:55:40.799 to be different and also we we don't00:55:42.920 really have good ways of measuring00:55:44.839 absolute values of dopamine in human00:55:47.520 beings right we can do that in rats but00:55:50.039 we can't really do that in humans it's00:55:51.960 it's relative values I've got this um00:55:54.640 picture here which shows what looks like00:55:56.720 brain scans in uh normal person but then00:56:00.240 in someone who's addicted to different00:56:01.880 substances I'll put this on the screen00:56:03.119 and I'll link it below in the00:56:04.440 description for anyone that needs it and00:56:06.119 wants to see it but it effectively shows00:56:08.319 the impact that like cocaine has on the00:56:10.160 brain meth um alcohol and heroin what is00:56:13.920 what is going on here so the red in this00:56:16.640 image represents dopamine transmission00:56:19.720 okay so how much dope mean is being00:56:21.520 released from the pr synaptic neuron00:56:23.480 Crossing that synapse binding to00:56:25.520 receptors on the Sy aptic neuron how00:56:27.319 much dopamine is kind of swirling around00:56:29.520 in the reward pathway part of the brain00:56:32.599 and what this image shows is that on the00:56:35.640 left hand side in healthy control00:56:37.880 subjects who do not have addiction00:56:40.760 there's plenty of red right so there's00:56:43.160 plenty of dopamine Transmission in the00:56:45.559 reward pathway specifically here in the00:56:48.039 nucleus accumbens but if you look at the00:56:50.680 right hand column you'll see that in00:56:52.960 these individuals who have been using00:56:55.319 cocaine meth amphetamine alcohol and00:56:57.720 heroin in addictive ways there's almost00:57:01.039 no red which means there's decreased or00:57:05.480 below normal levels of dopamine00:57:08.799 transmission they are in a chronic00:57:11.760 dopamine deficit00:57:14.920 State this is evidence of the brain00:57:18.880 trying to00:57:20.880 compensate for too much dopamine being00:57:24.160 triggered by down regulating its own00:57:27.119 dopamine production and transmission not00:57:29.319 just to Baseline but below00:57:31.599 Baseline and importantly these00:57:34.400 individuals who are addicted to these00:57:36.440 substances these brain scans were done00:57:39.079 two weeks after they stopped00:57:41.599 using oh wow yeah which tells us that00:57:45.079 this dop dopamine deficit State persists00:57:48.520 for some period of Time how long well it00:57:51.960 depends on the person but we know at00:57:53.839 least from this experiment that the00:57:55.799 first two weeks are this persistent00:57:58.480 dopamine deficit state which is00:58:00.680 consistent with acute withdrawal right00:58:03.240 people feel when they first stop their00:58:05.039 drug of choice they feel terrible right00:58:07.880 they experience all of the symptoms of00:58:10.119 physical withdrawal that correspond with00:58:12.400 that particular drug they were using00:58:14.599 usually the opposite of what the drug00:58:16.160 did plus the universal symptoms of00:58:18.480 withdrawal from any addictive substance00:58:20.240 or behavior anxiety irritability00:58:22.960 insomnia depression and craving now if00:58:25.520 they can get through the first 10 to 1400:58:28.240 days what we see clinically is those00:58:31.799 acute withdrawal symptoms slowly start00:58:34.480 to get better and we think that that is00:58:37.319 mapping on to regenerating dopamine00:58:40.920 Transmission in the reward pathway and00:58:43.640 if they can make it to a month that's00:58:46.000 usually the point for for on average in00:58:48.920 based on clinical experience when people00:58:51.359 really can start to get out of that00:58:54.319 constant state of craving for their drug00:58:56.359 of choice and begin to see some light at00:58:58.680 the end of the tunnel for what their00:59:00.200 lives might look like if they can00:59:03.039 maintain abstinence from their drug and00:59:05.280 we can't just inject or drink dopamine I00:59:07.960 mean I guess that would be like drinking00:59:09.079 alcohol we can't just artificially mess00:59:11.640 with the the balances to try and restore00:59:13.240 the dopamine levels in an addict can we00:59:15.079 can't just add a little bit of dopamine00:59:16.640 yeah it's it's a great question because00:59:18.760 we have some natural experiments that00:59:21.119 suggest what what might happen if we do00:59:23.000 that so as I mentioned before people00:59:25.000 with Parkinson's have depletion of DOP00:59:27.280 mean in the substan [ __ ] That's What00:59:29.559 Causes That that motor disease the00:59:32.480 treatment for it is to give L Doopa00:59:36.240 which is a dopamine precursor if I were00:59:38.400 to give you a spoonful of dopamine it00:59:39.799 would do absolutely nothing because it00:59:41.000 doesn't cross into the bra the brain it00:59:42.880 doesn't cross the blood brain barrier00:59:44.520 but I could give you lopa which is a00:59:46.839 precursor chemical that would cross your00:59:48.960 blood brain barrier and get turned into00:59:51.520 dopamine and then diffusely bind00:59:54.079 dopamine receptors in your brain in the00:59:56.240 reward pathway but also in the movement00:59:58.880 Pathways when we give patients with01:00:02.119 Parkinson's dopamine in this form that01:00:06.319 can temporarily improve their movements01:00:08.880 but in about one in four Parkinson's01:00:11.400 patients they will develop a denovo01:00:14.559 addictive disorder shopping addiction01:00:17.359 sex addiction other types of addiction01:00:20.599 because we have the same problem we are01:00:23.760 stimulating01:00:26.119 the reward pathway with dopamine that is01:00:29.599 ingested exogenously from the01:00:32.680 outside and our brain reads that as oh01:00:35.559 boy got to compensate by downregulating01:00:38.559 dopamine transmission to below Baseline01:00:41.400 which then puts us in that addiction01:00:43.280 Vortex does that make sense it does so01:00:45.440 we have to I mean it tells me that we01:00:47.520 have to live lives in a certain sense of01:00:51.839 we have to live our lives in a certain01:00:53.160 sort of01:00:54.680 homeostasis and01:00:56.440 it's so easy not to in the world we live01:00:58.799 in it's like it's like impossible to01:01:00.559 live in a perfect homeostasis balance in01:01:04.359 the world we live in right even more01:01:07.640 than having to try to live within this01:01:09.839 sort of narrow range of homeostasis in01:01:12.400 the world we live in today we probably01:01:13.920 have to intentionally do things that are01:01:16.599 painful do things that are hard pleasure01:01:19.480 pain balance like we learn that when we01:01:21.839 press on the pleasure side of the01:01:23.920 balance like with alcohol or pornography01:01:26.880 or romance novels or cannabis or01:01:28.720 whatever it is right no sooner does that01:01:31.640 happen than our brain adapts by those01:01:35.160 neuro adaptation Gremlins hopping on the01:01:36.920 pain side of the balance to bring it01:01:38.319 level again but they like it on the01:01:39.680 balance so they don't get off right when01:01:41.400 it's level they stay on until we're01:01:43.079 tilted an equal an opposite amount to01:01:45.359 the side of pain that's the come down01:01:46.760 the hangover Etc but it turns out the01:01:49.520 opposite is also true if we01:01:51.039 intentionally press on the pain side of01:01:53.279 the balance for example with exercise or01:01:56.480 an ice cold water bath or intermittent01:01:58.760 fasting those Gremlins will hop on the01:02:01.119 pleasure side of the balance and we will01:02:03.119 get our dopamine indirectly by paying01:02:05.640 for it up front and there are studies in01:02:09.119 humans showing that when humans expose01:02:12.880 themselves to exercise for01:02:15.039 example dopamine levels gradually rise01:02:18.200 over the latter half of the exercise and01:02:20.440 then when the exercise stops dopamine01:02:22.920 levels will remain elevated for hours01:02:25.599 after afterwards before going back down01:02:28.200 to the Baseline level position without01:02:31.079 ever going into that dopamine deficit01:02:33.160 state so it's a great way to get our01:02:35.279 dopamine in directly because it's much01:02:37.880 less vulnerable to that compulsive01:02:41.200 craving phenomenon of overuse so you're01:02:43.400 not going to get an exercise come down01:02:46.599 you can butc and people can get addicted01:02:49.920 to exercise right but typically it's01:02:52.480 it's very unusual because The Upfront01:02:55.240 cost01:02:56.440 to to do the work and endure the pain of01:02:59.720 exercise in the first place mitigates01:03:02.880 our vulnerability to an exercise01:03:04.960 addiction and in general H okay CU it's01:03:06.960 so hard to do that it's going to be it's01:03:09.119 not like pulling a lever on a slot01:03:10.559 machine or clicking on a porn website is01:03:13.599 difficult yes okay so fighting for the01:03:16.480 dopamine01:03:18.599 is insulates us against the chance of an01:03:21.279 addiction having to really fight hard01:03:22.640 for it okay yeah and this kind of01:03:24.160 explains I guess in part why01:03:26.559 I pulled out some stats ahead of our01:03:28.400 conversation today that from 1996 to01:03:31.880 2008 participation in ultramarathons has01:03:35.400 increased by01:03:39.240 1,676 the ice bath Market is expected to01:03:42.440 rise from 350 million in 2024 to to01:03:45.640 nearly half a billion by 2030 the number01:03:49.279 of people taking part in obstacle course01:03:51.200 races like tough mut or hrock etc etc01:03:54.319 has increased by almost 7x from 2010 to01:03:58.119 2017 it seems like in society there's01:04:00.359 this counter movement towards people01:04:02.440 seeking out hard dopamine chasing pain01:04:06.039 yeah those are amazing I didn't know01:04:07.480 that those are amazing numbers um you01:04:10.000 know in general there's a part of me01:04:11.640 that wants to say well that's a good01:04:13.279 thing um but there there's another part01:04:15.839 of me that's wary also because we're so01:04:18.599 good at drug aying everything that we do01:04:21.319 that there's a way in which these types01:04:23.359 of behaviors can also be drug aied right01:04:26.160 made more potent with all of the01:04:28.400 technology the way that we count01:04:30.160 ourselves the leaderboards the social01:04:32.799 comparisons all of that takes this thing01:04:34.960 which is really in its natural state01:04:38.079 kind of impervious to addiction like you01:04:40.359 just typically wouldn't get addicted to01:04:42.520 these types of painful physical01:04:44.960 activities you would do what you needed01:04:46.920 to do for survival but we've managed to01:04:49.839 make them addictive in all these01:04:51.240 different ways I still think it's a01:04:53.799 better way to get your dopamine like I01:04:55.400 really encourage exercise we always talk01:04:57.799 about movement as medicine and in01:05:00.240 general our our life is so convenient so01:05:02.960 easy so passive so sedentary that I'm01:05:05.920 telling patients all the time you know01:05:07.799 get up off the couch move your body walk01:05:10.079 around the block I think that's the01:05:12.480 bigger obstacle right now is just01:05:14.319 getting people to move but I do think we01:05:16.920 need to be wary of not going too far in01:05:19.440 the direction of like the ultra Ultra01:05:21.799 Ultra whatever it is so what is a better01:05:23.880 way to live if we're trying to optimize01:05:25.760 happiness and to keep our dopamine in01:05:27.279 balance and not have the crashes Etc and01:05:29.400 come downs and hangover what is a01:05:31.839 optimal way to live our lives do we have01:05:33.279 to look back at our caveman ancestors01:05:36.000 and live like them I think that part of01:05:39.640 the problem is that we've01:05:41.680 organized Our Lives now around01:05:45.960 rewards almost everything that we do is01:05:49.160 predicated on the Feelgood moment we'll01:05:52.640 have at the end of it and because of01:05:55.480 that that we01:05:56.960 are missing out on the01:05:59.599 process we're projecting our psyche01:06:02.440 forward into the future toward the01:06:04.480 reward and not able to really be here in01:06:08.279 the moment okay this is going to be01:06:10.000 sound weird I'm going to give you a01:06:11.000 weird example so driving over here today01:06:13.440 I found I was nervous for this interview01:06:16.880 and in a way looking forward to it but01:06:19.279 in a way wanting it to be over right and01:06:22.760 and in seeing that in myself I thought01:06:24.640 that's so sad like that's that's so sad01:06:27.079 that we live our lives that way myself01:06:29.000 included always this weird blend of01:06:31.920 wanting whatever we're doing to be over01:06:34.119 so that in a way we can just go hide and01:06:35.760 do whatever that self- steem thing is01:06:37.880 that we do where we're safe and we're01:06:39.799 like you know stimulating ourselves in01:06:41.839 some way and then I thought well what if01:06:44.559 I knew that I was going to die right01:06:47.599 after this going come off really weird01:06:50.480 now but what if I knew that I was01:06:52.520 actually going to die right after our01:06:54.119 conversation today01:06:56.359 that totally changes my perspective01:06:58.119 doesn't it because this time you and I01:07:00.240 have that's all I got it's over for me01:07:02.559 when this so this this conversation is01:07:04.599 it I really better be right here right01:07:06.599 now and really taking joy in whatever01:07:10.760 you and I can find together and and I01:07:13.119 think the more we can do that the better01:07:17.079 what's happening there you're removing01:07:18.799 the thought of the outcome the rewards01:07:20.799 the potential you know failure or01:07:22.599 whatever and you're focusing on just01:07:24.359 being present and in doing so what is01:07:27.160 happening it's a great question and I've01:07:29.839 actually given this quite a lot of01:07:31.160 thought because I remember when I was in01:07:32.799 college and I you know met some like Zen01:07:36.599 people and they were like be here now be01:07:39.520 here now and I thought well whenever I'm01:07:42.880 here now I'm miserable like I I I don't01:07:45.880 like me and I don't like being in the01:07:48.200 world I I don't want to be here now I01:07:50.279 want to be somewhere else so I didn't01:07:53.520 really understand what they were getting01:07:55.200 at01:07:55.960 it really took me you know till I had01:07:58.279 lived quite a lot of life and had some01:08:00.319 you know some significant experiences01:08:02.760 and given it some thought that I01:08:04.200 realized oh be here now means be here01:08:07.599 now and be01:08:09.079 uncomfortable and be okay with being01:08:12.520 uncomfortable and being okay with not01:08:14.680 being able to01:08:16.520 control my pleasure or my pain or my01:08:19.479 comfort level but just being open to01:08:21.960 whatever comes and I think that's a01:08:24.198 really a key shift01:08:26.880 that I'm not trying to control my01:08:29.439 experience in the moment and that it's01:08:31.880 okay to be unhappy or Restless or01:08:35.679 uncomfortable and not trying to run away01:08:37.920 from that but just really turn and face01:08:39.719 it and embrace the discomfort which I01:08:42.640 also think is quite Universal I don't01:08:44.560 think I'm I'm alone in that and then the01:08:48.040 key piece about not not anticipating the01:08:50.679 reward is helps me be in the moment01:08:54.880 right because I'm not just waiting for01:08:56.640 the good thing to come after I'm saying01:08:58.719 to myself imagine there's nothing good01:09:00.319 coming after nothing at all right01:09:02.600 there's just there aren't rewards this01:09:04.359 is it and then also being able to say01:09:07.520 and it's okay if in the moment like it's01:09:10.600 not great like I I can Embrace that you01:09:13.520 know I can be unhappy or Restless or01:09:18.000 anxious or whatever it is and then when01:09:20.759 I do that you know I feel like there's a01:09:23.399 funny funny thing that happens and all01:09:25.158 the sudden I I'm not as anxious right01:09:28.759 and I am present and it there is some01:09:32.158 Joy there interesting so when you allow01:09:35.279 yourself to deal with being01:09:36.279 uncomfortable in the moment it turns out01:09:39.839 you it removes the thing that was making01:09:41.520 you uncomfortable in the moment which is01:09:43.040 like the avoidance or the worry or01:09:45.759 overthinking whatever else yeah I I01:09:48.000 think we have this and it's fed by01:09:49.839 modern culture this kind of expectancy01:09:52.198 that really we should be happy all the01:09:54.440 time and if you know if we've arranged01:09:56.800 things appropriately for our lives and01:09:59.120 if we've done our work and you know01:10:01.760 aimed true then we should just be like01:10:04.400 life is great and I don't believe that01:10:07.600 anymore I think that you know I mean01:10:10.960 like Buddha said life is suffering but I01:10:13.880 really think that01:10:16.000 fundamentally like it's uncomfortable to01:10:19.040 be01:10:20.080 alive and that it's a kind of a constant01:10:22.719 state of restlessness and discomfort if01:10:25.000 we're being really honest and and tuning01:10:27.120 in when I really let myself see that and01:10:30.080 feel that all of a sudden I'm I'm freed01:10:34.280 from from some of01:10:38.400 that what has caused your anxiety01:10:40.640 throughout your life in the moment you01:10:42.400 you referenced earlier that some things01:10:43.719 have happened that have led you to01:10:46.040 understand this better and understand01:10:47.760 yourself better what is what am I01:10:49.520 missing from this jsaw puzzle yeah well01:10:51.560 you're you're good you could have been a01:10:53.199 psychiatrist oh really yeah it's always01:10:55.640 time this doesn't work out there's still01:10:57.880 time right it's not too late you get a01:10:59.360 new profession yay um I think you know01:11:01.719 for me the the big Turning Point um was01:11:05.280 that we lost our we lost a child and um01:11:10.120 in the immediate aftermath of our01:11:12.000 child's death I was just determined to01:11:16.199 like sort of undo the experience01:11:19.560 and um you know get enough Psychotherapy01:11:24.960 and enough whatever whatever it took to01:11:28.679 sort of not feel that pain and it wasn't01:11:31.440 until I really just said oh like I'm01:11:33.560 going to feel this pain for the rest of01:11:35.159 my life it's never going away that01:11:36.880 suddenly I felt some relief from that01:11:38.920 pain and that was a real window for01:11:42.040 me so interesting that the01:11:46.800 it's01:11:49.080 acceptance yeah and and you know and and01:11:52.000 I think you know one of the reasons I01:11:53.760 love treating patients with addiction is01:11:56.400 because I really relate to that hitting01:11:59.159 bottom moment you know that moment when01:12:01.719 it's like you just have the feeling that01:12:05.159 like everything I try to do to manage01:12:08.760 this Behavior or to make my life better01:12:10.800 only makes it worse I felt like I had a01:12:13.440 very similar01:12:14.840 experience um and that it was only when01:12:17.800 I kind of realized oh I yeah I I can't01:12:22.199 run from this I cannot run this pain uh01:12:25.000 that I I begin to have some the01:12:27.520 beginnings of relief from that01:12:29.920 experience I can't outrun this01:12:32.920 pain it's all natural sort of01:12:35.600 disposition to try and outrun pain isn't01:12:37.199 it that's the irony right we're really01:12:39.600 wired to outrun the pain we are like we01:12:42.480 reflexively seek out pleasure and avoid01:12:44.600 pain and yet that's the very thing thing01:12:46.920 that doesn't get us to where we want to01:12:48.880 go but we do now live in a world where01:12:52.040 it's very easy to outrun the pain yes01:12:54.800 this is a lion that's chasing me this01:12:56.679 could be a bad email and then I open up01:12:58.880 a tab and start Doom scrolling or open01:13:01.440 up a tab and start watching video01:13:03.400 playing video games or pornography or01:13:05.440 whatever yeah that's exactly right there01:13:07.960 are so many ways that we can now01:13:09.639 distract ourselves from you know our own01:13:12.239 suffering or our own01:13:14.080 awareness and where do you find yourself01:13:16.040 now with dealing with that grief and the01:13:18.400 pain as we sit here yeah I mean I I feel01:13:22.080 like in many ways it's been a real gift01:13:24.159 in my life you know it's really informed01:13:26.480 my life in in ways that um I mean I I've01:13:31.480 learned things from that experience that01:13:33.560 I think it would have been almost01:13:35.199 impossible for me to learn otherwise you01:13:38.040 deal with a lot of people that are in a01:13:40.480 state of01:13:42.040 suffering01:13:44.840 I imagine that's a01:13:47.040 weight because I um even hearing the01:13:50.000 story of the lady that passed away after01:13:51.840 that water addiction it was like a it01:13:53.360 was like a weight on my shoulders just01:13:54.560 to hear it01:13:55.639 so if your profession puts you right at01:13:58.120 the heart of this type of suffering how01:14:00.560 do01:14:01.880 you manage that to to hold that01:14:05.880 weight a couple things um first of all a01:14:09.080 lot of people get better and when people01:14:11.800 with addiction get better01:14:14.040 it's so much better that it's incredibly01:14:17.760 rewarding to see and they're amazing01:14:19.960 people Absolut like the most tenacious01:14:22.920 talented people you'll ever meet and01:14:25.239 when they get better it impacts so many01:14:28.320 other people right their friends their01:14:30.360 family the people they work with so it's01:14:33.280 very rewarding work and and not at all01:14:35.920 burdensome of course you know for01:14:38.120 patients who don't don't get better or01:14:41.040 patients who die it's a terrible feeling01:14:44.679 and there is a sense of um01:14:47.120 responsibility and and guilt even when I01:14:49.679 feel like there was nothing that I could01:14:51.080 have done otherwise um you know I carry01:14:53.880 those losses with me so it's hard is01:14:56.400 there any particular cases that have01:14:58.320 stayed with you the most I mean every01:15:00.920 patient I've had who's died while under01:15:03.639 my care those are incredibly painful um01:15:07.440 and I will never you know those are sort01:15:10.040 of a those people will be with me as a01:15:14.159 part of me for all of my life young and01:15:17.000 old yeah young and old yeah it's01:15:19.120 especially tragic to you to lose young01:15:21.560 people and it always feels like their01:15:24.520 second gu ing like oh if only I had done01:15:26.960 that or if only we had intervened here01:15:29.199 but I just think that's the nature of01:15:31.120 death we we can't get away from the01:15:33.239 feelings of guilt around it no matter01:15:35.239 who we are and no matter the01:15:37.280 circumstances how young can addiction01:15:40.800 and the consequences of01:15:42.560 addiction ruin someone's life like how01:15:44.920 young can someone be when their life is01:15:46.320 ruined from from the work you've done01:15:47.639 and the the patients you've worked with01:15:49.880 and what are those addictions typically01:15:51.600 that seem to be most um susceptible to01:15:54.400 those that are young01:15:56.800 well I mean you know some some kids01:15:59.800 start with drugs and alcohol you know01:16:03.199 five six seven eight five six yeah I01:16:06.199 mean it's you know some some some kids01:16:08.280 use with their parents or their01:16:09.920 caregivers they're exposed very early if01:16:13.199 we seriously conceptualize digital media01:16:16.239 as a drug I mean then we've got you know01:16:18.639 even younger cohorts starting with that01:16:20.800 and we do know that kids can get01:16:23.679 addicted to digital media01:16:25.840 and as a result um die from that I mean01:16:29.000 there was just this tragic case of a01:16:31.560 young man who essentially got addicted01:16:34.239 to a chat box I think he was 14 not my01:16:37.000 patient it was written up um in the New01:16:39.199 York Times in the Wall Street Journal01:16:41.560 and he fell in love with this chat box01:16:43.280 started to isolate wasn't spending time01:16:45.199 with his family or friends and then01:16:47.560 eventually took his own life purportedly01:16:50.000 so he could join this imaginary person01:16:55.880 what's the youngest patient you've ever01:16:57.239 seen the youngest I've seen is probably01:16:59.960 around 15 14 15 and they had an01:17:02.880 addiction yeah usually cannabis alcohol01:17:06.239 nicotine can you get addicted to01:17:07.960 cannabis oh yeah oh my gosh cannabis is01:17:12.080 very addictive really oh yeah01:17:15.880 yeah harmful very harmful the target01:17:19.639 organ that it damages the most is the01:17:22.040 brain um it's harmful in many ways I01:17:25.120 mean it number one it demotivates people01:17:29.480 often and so they can have the feeling01:17:32.679 that they're getting stuff done or that01:17:34.480 they're creative when in fact they're01:17:35.840 not doing01:17:37.400 anything um it most people smoke it and01:17:41.040 so it can be damaging to the lungs and01:17:43.199 and other other organs um a lot of01:17:46.199 people say that well cannabis isn't01:17:47.840 addictive because I don't have this01:17:49.920 standard withdrawal phenomenon when I01:17:51.719 stop like I don't have the shakes or01:17:53.360 anything like that but keep in mind the01:17:55.520 universal symptoms of addiction are01:17:57.760 psychological symptoms anxiety01:17:59.600 irritability depression insomnia craving01:18:02.520 and people have that in Spades when they01:18:04.440 try to stop using cannabis plus we often01:18:07.000 see something called the hyperemesis01:18:09.280 syndrome so cannabis can help with01:18:12.120 nausea and vomiting it can help decrease01:18:14.760 the feeling of wanting to vomit but01:18:18.239 again as the brain continues to be01:18:20.800 exposed to it there's this process of01:18:22.880 neuro adaptation it stops working and it01:18:25.440 can even turn on them and do the01:18:27.239 opposite So eventually people can01:18:29.440 actually have a cyclical vomiting01:18:31.480 syndrome as a result of cannabis so01:18:34.560 they'll show up in the emergency room01:18:35.639 and say I can't stop I can't stop01:18:37.199 vomiting and the reason is because of01:18:39.520 the Cannabis that they maybe initially01:18:41.600 started uh to stop feelings of01:18:45.440 nausea on page 40 of dopamine Nation you01:18:48.880 say we've lost the ability to tolerate01:18:50.719 even minor forms of discomfort yeah and01:18:52.800 as I was reading through this section of01:18:54.040 your book I was thinking it sounds like01:18:56.440 we've gone a little bit soft in society01:18:59.760 um we've reset our pleasure pain01:19:02.560 threshold to the side of pain that even01:19:04.800 the slightest thing feels like trauma to01:19:06.679 us even things that objectively speaking01:19:08.679 a generation or two ago would not have01:19:10.679 been considered traumatic are now trauma01:19:13.120 we live in a bit of a trauma Society uh01:19:15.280 one that doesn't appear to be very01:19:16.520 resilient and the only measure of that01:19:17.920 that I have is if I think about the work01:19:19.440 that my grandfather had to do versus the01:19:21.719 work that you know people maybe in my01:19:23.88"
