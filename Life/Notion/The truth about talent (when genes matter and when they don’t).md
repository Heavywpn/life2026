  

==**The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition**==

  

==**Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities**==

  

> ==**Genes do not determine your destiny**==

  

==**They determine your areas of opportunity**==

  

==**Genes can predispose, but they can also predetermine**==

  

### How your personality influences your habits

  

==**Your genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed, beneath the surface of every behaviour**==

  

==**Your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose you to a particular personality. Your personality is the set of characteristics that is consistent from situation to situation**==

  

==**Five spectrums of behaviour**==

1. ==**Openness to experience:**== ==**From curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other**==
2. ==**Conscientiousness:**== ==**Organized and efficient to easy going and spontaneous**==
3. ==**Extroversion:**== ==**Outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (extroverts & introverts)**==
4. ==**Agreeableness:**== ==**Friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached**==
5. ==**Neuroticism:**== ==**Anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable**==

==**All 5 characteristics have biological underpinnings**==

  

==**Our habits are not solely determined by our personalities, but there is no doubt that our genes nudge us in a certain direction. Our deeply rooted preferences make certain behaviours easier for some people than for others**==

  

==**The takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your personality**==

  

==**You don’t have to build the habits everyone tells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular. There is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and satisfaction. Find it.**==

  

==**Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to stick. This is the core idea behind the 4th Law**==

### How to find a game where the odds are in your favour

  

==**Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favour is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful.**==

  

==**In theory, you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are amore likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you.**==

  

==**People who are talented in a particular area tend to be more competent at that task and are then praises for doing a good job. They stay energized because they are making progress where others have failed, and because they get rewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them happier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality works. It’s a virtuous cycle**==

  

==**Pick the right habit and progress is easy.**  
**Pick the wrong habit and progress is a struggle.**==

  

==**When a habit is easy, you are more likely to be successful. When you are successful, you are more likely to feel satisfied**==

  

==**Explore/exploit trade-off:**==

==**In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net. After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution you’ve found, but keep experimenting occasionally.**==

  

==**The proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore.**==

  

==**In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80% of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 20%**==

  

==**Questions to ask when exploring and narrowing in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you:**==

  

1. ==**What feels like fun to me, but work to others?**==
    
    ==**Can you handle the pain of the task easier than most people. The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do**==
    

  

1. ==**What makes me lost track of time?**==
    
    ==**The flow state is a blend of happiness and peak performance. It is nearly impossible to experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree**==
    
      
    
2. ==**Where do I get greater returns than the average person?**==
    
    ==**We are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behaviour is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favour**==
    
      
    
3. ==**What comes naturally to me?**==
    
    ==**Ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Looks inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction**==
    
      
    
      
    

==**We all have limited time on this planet, and the truly great among us are the ones who not only work hard but also have the good fortune to be expose to opportunities that favour us**==

  

==**Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort**==

  

> ==**When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different**==

  

==**By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules.**==

  

==**A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing.**  
**A great player creates a new game that favours their strengths and avoids their weakness**==

  

==**Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the accident of bad genetics**==

  

> ==**The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you**==

  

==**Even if you’re not the most naturally gifted, you can often win by being the best in a very narrow category**==

  

==**If you can find a more favourable environment, you can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to one where they are in your favour**==

  

### How to get the most out of your genes

  

> ==**Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. they clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.**==

  

==**Once we realize our strengths, we know where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.**==

  

==**Biological differences matter. Even so, it’s more productive to focus on whether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to someone else. The fact that you have a natural limit to any specific ability has nothing to do with whether you are reading the ceiling of your capabilities. People get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to them.**==

  

==**Furthermore, genes can’t make you successful if you’re not doing the work**==

  

==**Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck**==

  

==**In summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviours that align with your personality and skills. Work hard on the things that come easy.**==
