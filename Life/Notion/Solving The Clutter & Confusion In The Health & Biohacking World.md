Transcipt: "0:00Ben Greenfield: What do you think   is the biggest barrier for people who  are tuning into podcasts like this?0:05Caleb Applegate: Information complete overload. Ben Greenfield: Guilty as charged.  0:11So how do you think about the  information overload solution then? Caleb Applegate: I think this is like a really good   lead in to talk about the advent of what you and I  have been kind of concocting, creating, building,  0:24crafting in the background to solve these  types of problems for everyday folks like us.0:32Ben Greenfield: I am super excited about  0:44today's show because I get to interview  my best friend. And even though you   might be wondering why the heck I'd just be  interviewing one of my pals on the podcast,  0:53it goes way beyond that. So if you listen to  my show, if you read my articles on my website,  1:00follow me on social media, or digest anything from  Ben Greenfield Life, the man at the helm of the  1:08amazing team working at Ben Greenfield Life.  And the president of the company is my guest  1:14on today's show, Caleb Applegate. Caleb, he'll  share with you his deep history and an impressive  1:24career leading up to, coming up to Ben Greenfield  Life. But I thought, gosh, there's so much that  1:30you guys get that is produced in the secret Batman  labs up here in the inland northwest that I gotta  1:38get the man behind the scenes on the show because  he's a wealth of knowledge, not just in business,  1:44but he's also tuned into the health, the  biohacking, the fitness world and beyond.1:50Ben Greenfield: And you're actually gonna start seeing Caleb   more and more places, too. For example, he'll  be presenting at the Health Optimization Summit  1:56coming up in London. Although this podcast might  be coming out after that show, you're going to see  2:01him a lot more popping up with some new projects  that we have going at Ben Greenfield Life as well.  2:07So I thought, what the heck, Caleb? I might as  well have you on the show. What do you think? Caleb Applegate: Ben, thanks for  2:12having me, man. Pleasure to be here. Ben Greenfield: Yeah. And you have   a pretty funny story that you tell.  I think you tell it better than me  2:20about how we actually connected up here in  Spokane. It involves me dirty and barefoot.2:29Caleb Applegate: It does involve you   dirty and barefoot, dialed in, zoned in on  one of your walking calls outside. But yeah,  2:37you're right. It's funny. This was right during  the middle, or actually at the beginning of  2:43COVID. We were looking for land. We have three  kids. My wife and I decided, hey, this is a good  2:50time to go get on a piece of property. And  so we actually were able to get something.2:57Caleb Applegate: Turns out, what, ten minutes from your old place,   North Spokane. And literally, the day that  we're moving, we're driving down the road,  3:06and I see this guy, barefoot, shirtless, walking  down the road, like, in the zone as you're   walking. And I'm like, wait a minute, I know this  guy. Turns out I didn't have your number anymore  3:18because we had met years before, through your mom,  actually, and I had to message you on Facebook,  3:26dude, I think we just moved ten minutes from  where you're at. We should get together. And   that kind of began the next season of our  families getting together quite often.3:37Ben Greenfield: Yeah. And at the time, you weren't, at least   to my recollection, you were super tuned into  the health and biohacking world at that point.3:50Caleb Applegate: No. That may be an understatement. No. In fact,   I would ping you all the time, if you recall, hey,  what do you think about this? Or, hey, I'm feeling  4:00a certain way, and you would always send me,  because you've probably written about literally  4:06everything. You have, the Bible. With Boundless,  it's easy for you to just like, hey, check out  4:12this article, or, I just did this podcast, or  you'd really get a lot of information extracted  4:17out of this new thing we just put out. And so  it was like you were the information repository,  4:24and I was like, holy smokes, this guy is dialed  in. I have to just have to keep asking questions.4:30Caleb Applegate: So I was probably that,   at least at first, that annoying  guy that kept pinging you.4:36Ben Greenfield: Yeah, it kind of went both ways, though,   because you were, like, the expert on business  building, the metaverse, information technology,  4:45crypto, all these things I didn't know much  about. I think that would actually be interesting   for people. Before we talk about the direction  that you've taken with health and fitness and  4:55what your routines and rituals are looking like  now. Where'd you actually come from before that? Caleb Applegate: Right, yeah, no, it's a great  5:01question. In fact, a pastor friend of ours likes  to say, God draws straight with crooked lines, and  5:08I'm definitely that crooked line story. And so,  yeah, years ago, I started in the entertainment  5:15space. I was blessed enough to have my first film  produced by Leonardo DiCaprio's company, Appian  5:23Way. And so that was kind of the first push into  the film industry, into the entertainment space,  5:30and it was an amazing experience, once in a  lifetime opportunity. I was able to take my  5:35family, but we made the decision at that  point that we didn't want to live in LA  5:41and raise our kids in LA. And so we landed  in Moscow, Idaho, where I would eventually  5:48meet you and other really great friends.  And we fell in love with the community.5:54Caleb Applegate: And we knew because we were making   that choice, the entertainment industry might  not be as accessible. I would have to travel a  6:01lot. And so we looked at alternative opportunities  on more of a local level. And it was through that  6:09that I opened a restaurant. And Moscow was  able to experiment with a few startups, but  6:15ultimately started offering consulting services.  And it wasn't that I put myself out there as the  6:22people would ask me advice on things, or, hey,  would you be willing to step in and help with  6:30this particular project? And one of  those projects, as it turns out, was a   Minecraft gaming server that needed some business  development executive help. And so I was able to,  6:42kind of the TLDR version of that was, I'm  not a gamer at all, but I did love business,  6:50and so was able to make the connection  with Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks,  6:57and envision and dream the American  Airlines center arena inside of Minecraft.  7:04And so ultimately this got the attention of  Microsoft and Mojang, all things considered.7:10Caleb Applegate: Long story short,   our server, Mineplex, was one of three that  helped pioneer the Minecraft marketplace that  7:17we know today. And we were super early, but  helped kind of build that all out. So it was  7:23an amazing experience. Then you mentioned  metaverse. This is where things get even  7:29more just funny and odd. It was through the  gaming ecosystem, we were using this gaming  7:41community connector. It was called Enjin.  This was pre-NFTs, pre-Enjin Coin ICO.7:52Caleb Applegate: We were using the   Enjin client. And so through that process  of getting to know the team over there,  8:00we started working together. And so they  brought me on as an advisor. And then  8:05after a good amount of time of helping  them kind of see things a bit different,  8:11they asked if I would come on board as a COO. So  I ran Enjin, which was then a top 50 blockchain  8:17company for four years. Had a blast, have huge  respect for those guys. Was able to co-found a  8:24token over there called EFI on Polkadot. And so,  yeah, became it was just all things blockchain.8:31Caleb Applegate: Taking what I've learned   from gamification, but really digging into the  software stack of things and understanding how  8:39information moves. Consequently, or I should  say, incidentally, Enjin pioneered the whole  8:47concept of a non-fungible token. This was  early days, 2017, right alongside cryptopunks,  8:55Witek Radomski, the CTO and co-founder of  Enjin, pioneered ERC 1155 standard and had  9:04envisioned this whole, what we coined a  multiverse where a game could mint items,  9:12melt them and remint them in another game. In  fact, it was a non-fungible token that actually  9:19had value in an ecosystem of interoperability. So  that's the whole metaverse Web3 NFT intersection.9:30Ben Greenfield: So my very rudimentary understanding   of that would be like the ninja sort of power  that I acquired in one game could actually  9:36have some type of value and be traded across  a different platform or something like that?9:42Caleb Applegate: Yep, absolutely. Absolutely. And Vtech had   such an incredible pioneering vision for this. I  mean, the stuff that Enjin did and has been doing  9:53still is just incredible, cutting edge. Again,  I have nothing but huge respect for those guys.9:59Ben Greenfield: Well, you've come a long way, baby,   because now you and I have conversations about the  EMF and blue light levels of VR headsets and how  10:10they could be heating and destroying tissue in the  brain. And so you've pivoted a little bit, man.10:15Caleb Applegate: I have pivoted a little bit. Look,   so blockchain has been a blast. I still kind  of dabble. And I sit on a board of a company  10:25called Passage that previously I was the  CEO of and another just incredible team.  10:33I love it. I think the principles behind  blockchain, governance, participation,  10:41bringing community together. An infinite ledger  of transaction history, immutability, trustless.  10:48I think so many principles that are embedded  in the DNA of blockchain, I just naturally  10:56gravitate towards. It's easy for me to talk  about what is money, who assigns it its value.11:02Caleb Applegate: The advent of bitcoin   introduced all sorts of, I think, very  critical, very compelling narratives,  11:10and we should be asking these questions. However,  you and I got together and started just talking  11:17about the world of health and wellness. And  this was really my own journey of having   some health issues and admittedly being a  little bit, just a little bit overweight.11:28Ben Greenfield: But you had an excuse for the   sector that you were working in. I mean, it's kind  of funny because, not to distract us too much,  11:36but River and Terran, my sons and I are headed  over to America's biggest gaming convention called  11:42Gen Con because my sons have started this card  game and board game business. And we were watching  11:48the instructional video for registration and  kind of like looking at videos of previous year's  11:56conferences and I warned them, I'm like, guys,  this is not going to be a fitness convention,   right? And not the stereotype. I'm going to offend  a lot of gamers. I'm sure. But I told them you  12:05guys are probably going to see a lot of giant  monster energy drinks, neck beards, piercings,  12:12goth makeup, giant oversized t-shirts, and people  playing Dungeons & Dragons and Catan until like  12:193 a.m. under blue lights. Like, just be prepared  that this is the sector that we're venturing into.12:25Caleb Applegate: Yeah, no, it's true.   It's true. I think the background backend  principles of gaming, usability, engineering,  12:39what draws a person to use a product, that  type of conversation and kind of deep dive  12:48diligence is what I gravitate towards.  I want to know what makes people tick,   what they like, what they need, what's part of  their everyday rhythm, what makes them better.13:01Ben Greenfield: Now, since I brought you   on to Ben Greenfield Life, I'm just curious, what  has changed? I realize that's a loaded question  13:10as far as like your routine, what you've learned,  what big changes that you've made because you've  13:15transformed your body. I know that you're doing  a lot now as far as your own routine, what have  13:22been the biggest game changers for you in your  own routine, things that you've picked up here?13:27Caleb Applegate: Well, you've had   two guests on your podcast that made a huge  impact on me. Number one, Dallas Jenkins,  13:35who is a friend of yours, also a friend of  mine. Dallas was the original individual that  13:44got me into the film industry and helped  me out, introduced me to my entertainment  13:50attorney. And this is way back. This is  like 2000, I want to say 2007, maybe.13:56Ben Greenfield: By the way,   I'll link to that in the show notes.  Bengreenfieldlife.com/applegate is where the  14:02show notes are. Bengreenfieldlife.com/applegate,  Caleb's last name. But Dallas Jenkins, and I'll  14:08put that interview in there, he directed The  Chosen, which a lot of people are familiar with.14:14Caleb Applegate: Yep, he did. He's had an incredible journey,   but he gave some very practical, everyday habits  and disciplines that really spoke to me when I  14:26listened to that podcast. And I hadn't connected  with Dallas since he had done The Chosen,   it's been a while. But it was like, hey,  I can do this. This isn't actually that  14:37difficult. I can do this. Another gentleman  you had on your podcast was Michael Chernow,   Kreatures of Habit and his discipline stack.  I had to relisten to that over and over.14:49Caleb Applegate: I'm like, this guy has his shit together. He is   so dialed. I would say between those two and then  just being around you and just, you know, I don't  15:02want to be like the guy that looks like you just  ate a bag of Doritos. I want to actually, like,  15:08try to be better. And being around you, listening  to a few of, some of the guests that you've had  15:15on, I'm like, look, I've got to get serious  about this. On top of that, I have a wife who's,  15:22so I'm 6'3\", she's 5'3\", and she's a personal  trainer and loves homeopathy. Like, she has been  15:29the champion in our family, really pressing for  better health, better food, better environment,  15:37just all the way around, better ecosystem.  And I'm the guy that's been like, you know,   I have to work, I have to build, I have to create.15:44Caleb Applegate: I have to, you know,   make a better life for my family. All the  while, my own body is breaking down. And  15:51so I finally started listening to her who says,  look at these things and listen to what Ben is  15:59saying, like, do these things. So  I think it's been an amalgam of a   bunch of different variables that have been  very influential into my current routine.16:09Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I get that   sometimes the spouse who says, you can't believe  how much money you've cost me after my significant  16:17other recommended the insert podcast here, the  Red Light podcast, the Toxic Mattress podcast,  16:24et cetera. So my apologies to folks who have  had their spouse introduce them to my podcast,  16:31but it's kind of funny. Caleb, a couple of  things came up for me as you were talking   about those podcasts that were a couple of  your favorites, the Dallas Jenkins show. I  16:39also learned a ton from that, one of the big  takeaways. And I don't know if you tried this,   he had debilitating low back pain. And one  of the recommendations that he gave on there,  16:51amongst a lot of really great recommendations for  low back pain, was to foam roll your butt. Foam  16:56roll your butt. And I started doing that more  intensively, like two or three times a week.17:02Ben Greenfield: And it is incredible   how if you kind of sit on a foam roller, you  kind of slap one leg on top of the other leg,  17:08and you start at the base of your knee and just  shimmy your body all the way up to your butt,   get up to your butt, weave back and forth, dig  into the tissue, then go back down to the knee,  17:19and you do that as about like ten passes or  so per side. And then I'll even lay myself  17:24on top of the foam roller and kind of like,  bring. This is difficult to describe an audio,   but I'm going to try it. I'll loop one  leg over the other leg and kind of like,  17:33crack the back on one side and then loop over the  other leg and crack the back on the other side.  17:38Not. That's an incredible move. Did you try any of  the butt foam rolling after listening to that one?17:44Caleb Applegate: Yeah. No, look, I didn't just   try it. I've been doing it every single day since  then. Um, that is the single biggest game changer,  17:52because a lot like Dallas, I, too, have lower  back pain. Or did. So I didn't just get a roller,  17:59though. I actually got one of those theragun  rollers where you can, like, create vibration.18:05Caleb Applegate: Oh, dude, game   changer. Love it. I do it every morning.  So my morning stack is a little bit of a  18:12blend of what Michael Chernow talked about and  Dallas talked about. So I start with rolling.  18:18So I'll do that a good, you know, 10, 15  minutes. And I do butt, legs, feet even.18:25Caleb Applegate: Then I'll jump into a workout,   usually 30 to 45 minutes. Oftentimes it's  walking or running or I do a lot of, like,  18:34peloton biking, which is really fun. And then I'll  jump into the sauna, do that for 25 to 30 minutes,  18:40hit the cold plunge. Thanks to our friends at  Morozko, I love their tub. And then have some  18:49quiet, meditative time, prayer time, and jump  into my workday. So even during the workouts,  18:54though, I'll be. I'm kind of addicted to work.  I love what I do, so I'm constantly just. Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I want to dig   into your ritual a little bit more. But you also  mentioned Michael Chernow, and apparently he went  19:04and flew down in high school with Lance Armstrong  in Texas. Recently, I just found out about this,   and Lance actually invested in that company  that Michael and I talked about on the show,  19:13the Kreatures of Habit Meal One. These little  done-for-you oatmeal packets. And I got some  19:19of those after the interview with him. What  I do is I soak them overnight in half-apple  19:27cider vinegar and half-water. And these are,  like, nostalgic flavors that you might remember   from Quaker oatmeal, if you're listening in.  Like, blueberry, and they got, like, a maple.19:36Ben Greenfield: It's fantastic. They   got chocolate. They got a vanilla apple cinnamon,  which is definitely nostalgic to the Quaker piece.  19:43You soak it overnight. These are glyphosate  free oats, and it makes, like, this kind of,   like, mushy pudding that I can use as a smoothie  filler that I can use for dessert. Like, a lot of  19:54times my dessert is yogurt with dark chocolate and  berries. But sometimes I'll put a spoonful of that   Meal One in there. And for travel, it's incredible  because you got these packets, you mix them up,  20:05you know, hotel room, you don't want to go  down to the nasty continental breakfast. Ben Greenfield: I'll even, I don't   know if I told you this, Caleb. I'll surf to  the airport. I go up to Starbucks when I want  20:13to have a meal in the airport because I always  have a couple of the Meal One packets in my bag,  20:18and I asked them what I say so I can get free  hot water because some of these basketballs will  20:24charge, like, $0.75 for hot water. As I say, it's  not technically a lie, but I say I have oatmeal,  20:31but I forgot to get hot water. Do you have hot  water in a spoon that you can give me in a cup?  20:37I'm sure they think I probably got the oatmeal  at Starbucks, and we're gonna get hot water at   Starbucks. But anyways, they graciously give me  the hot water, the spoon, I mix up the oatmeal,  20:46and this is like, you know, usually as I'm  walking to my gate, by the time I get to my gate,   it's soaked in that hot water. It's nice,  it's mushy, and I can have a meal if I'm  20:54traveling. And even though I often fast when I  travel, some of these longer bouts, you know,   if I've worked out in the morning, whatever,  I want some to, some to crush, it's healthy.21:03Ben Greenfield: So the Meal One, I'm glad you brought it up,   because that's been a winner, and it stops for  me. I got a whole pantry full of those things.21:10Caleb Applegate: Yeah, same. I have it   five days a week. Uh, typically, we do something  else on the weekends because we're together as a  21:17family, but during the week, again, game  changers. Super practical in a packet,  21:23and I'm moving so quick on, you know, just,  uh, in my routine in the mornings because  21:29I've got so much on my plate for the day,  so I've got to be ultra disciplined, like,   down to the minute. So its really  nice to just take that packet,  21:36dump it in. I take some walnut halves, throw it  in. I love putting the Kion colostrum into that.21:44Caleb Applegate: I mean, it just makes   it milky and smooth and so good. Put  some water in, maybe cut up a banana  21:51and a pinch of colima salt. I dont know  if youve done that. So good, man. So good.21:57Ben Greenfield: Yeah, its incredible. This is   turning a giant commercial for Kreatures of Habit.  But one more tip is when you soak it overnight,  22:03even though it's got, like, pumpkin seeds  and chia seeds, got all this stuff in it,   you put a few scoopfuls of chia seeds in  there, and it turns into, like, this thick,  22:11gelatinous pudding. So you can make it  even thicker with the addition of chia   seeds before you do the overnight soak. So  you gotta try that one if you haven't yet.22:18Caleb Applegate: As it turns out,   man, you and I are foodies.  We like to eat good food. Ben Greenfield: I know, I know.  22:24How has your diet actually changed since you  started? Kind of like, soaking up a lot more   from Ben Greenfield life and working behind the  scenes, you know, chatting with partners, like,  22:34you know, Kreatures of Habit or whatever  else, getting your hands on a lot of this   stuff. I'm just curious how it's evolved,  because, well, I mean, I'll open the kimono  22:42on this a little bit. You know, the town that  you and I kind of originate from and met in is  22:49a town that has a very kind of, like. It's  like a large reformed protestant community,  22:56the church that you and I attended. But  it's very much like giant Sabbath feasts   and cigar and whiskey. And it's not necessarily  focused that much on healthy diets, per se.23:07Ben Greenfield: I was a part of that   culture. I know you were. But I'm just  curious how it's changed from kind of  23:12like that general mentality to being a little  bit more aware of your nutrients in your diet.23:19Caleb Applegate: Yeah, well, look, you   are right. The community and culture that we've  been a part of is rich and beautiful and glorious  23:28and just eat the fat, really lean in and enjoy  God's bounty. I think for me personally, because  23:38every body type is different, being more aware  of what I'm putting into my body. In other words,  23:45you know, I have a propensity to like sugar  and sweets. You know, cheesecake is probably  23:54one of the biggest things that I've, at  least recently been, having to navigate.23:59Ben Greenfield: Especially, by the way,   at my mom's coffee shop that you alluded  to, they had pretty hefty cheesecake there.24:05Caleb Applegate: Yeah, 100%. And so I just. It's discipline,   right? I don't say no. I say sometimes, and I try  to work for it. One of the tips that you gave me,  24:16and this has been also a game changer. I was  actually sharing this with some folks at a new gym  24:22that I joined yesterday. And that is like going  to bed hungry, right? It's okay to be hungry.  24:30Right before the opposite of that was, I'm eating  so much that I'm constantly full. I feel bloated,  24:38I feel heavy, I feel thick. Going on a walk after  dinner, and I'm just like, this is miserable.24:44Caleb Applegate: The opposite of that   is eat just enough, portion out what you need.  Really. What is it that you need? That's the  24:50question that I've been asking myself. And the  feeling of being satisfied and then turning into  24:57that hungry state right before bed, it feels at  first you're like, man, I want to go snack or  25:05something. But if you hold the line, you feel  so much better. And your mind is clearer, too.25:12Ben Greenfield: Yeah, there's a certain character   developing, stoic, shut up, the inner bitch type  of mentality that's involved with going to bed  25:22hungry. But it's kind of funny, because before you  moved down to Moscow, you and I used to have a lot  25:28of these conversations over dinner, and I haven't  even filled you in on this yet, but now I think   you can have your cake and eat it, too. So I'll  tell you why. You know our mutual friend Martin,  25:36who you're doing the Shark Tank Panel with at  the Health Optimization Summit. Martin Tobias. Caleb Applegate: Love Martin. Yep.25:42Ben Greenfield: Okay. I don't remember   if you were at this dinner. We were down at  Lodgepole in Moscow. Let me know if this.  25:48If this jogs your memory or if you weren't at  this dinner. And Martin, who's also a foodie,  25:53he comes in, and I'd already ordered up,  like, five killer appetizers. It was, like,   pork belly and deviled eggs and these beautiful  salads. And, you know, they're wonderful.26:04Ben Greenfield: You know, fresh   baked warm bread with the butter there.  They put all sorts of herbs into. And  26:09Martin ponies up. He sits down, and I'm  watching. During the whole dinner, he has,  26:15like, a couple of glasses of water and half  of one of the deviled eggs. And he's like,  26:21I'm just not hungry. He's like, I can't eat. And  it turns out that he had started onto a zemp, the  26:27GLP-1 agonist, to try it out. Hopefully, I'm not  outing Martin on this show. My apologies, Martin.26:33Caleb Applegate: We were there. I remember this. Ben Greenfield: Yeah, okay. You were   there. He couldn't. He was nauseous. And that was  when I first started thinking about GLP-1. Now,  26:41long story short, since then, I've written  a lot of articles and done podcasts and some   of the dangers of long-term use of that peptide.  But the mechanism of action is to increase GLP-1  26:52to GLP-1 agonists, as the name implies. And that  makes you feel full. Well, since then I've been  26:59looking at other agents that could act similarly  that give you the same release of satiety-inducing  27:05hormones. There's three of them, namely GLP, one  called CCK, one called PYY. Turns out that you  27:14can consume certain compounds that make you feel  full and satiated, meaning you can eat less for  27:21say dinner or lunch if that's your vice, go to  bed, feel satisfied, but also you've eaten less.27:31Ben Greenfield: And two of the most powerful things   I've found besides ketone. I used to use ketones  for this for a long time, like the drinkable  27:37ketone esters. And now the two things are, you can  increase GLP-1 production and appetite-regulating  27:47hormones via your microbiome. This company called  Pendulum, they've been sponsored the podcast in  27:53the past. They have a probiotics called the GLP-1  probiotic. And again, I don't remember if I've  27:59told you about these two, Caleb, but you take it  when you wake up in the morning and it stabilizes  28:04your appetite throughout the day. It's acromantia,  albutericum and lactobacillus probiotic blended  28:10together. So that's one strategy, but  then the second one is even more powerful.28:15Ben Greenfield: So if you can trigger the   bitter receptors in your small intestine, then  you don't get hungry. The problem is the amount  28:24of bitterness that it takes to do that is highly  unpalatable. Like a lot of people will say, oh,  28:30use apple cider vinegar or the peels of certain  citrus fruits or bitter meal and extract or  28:35whatever. None of those are bitter enough to make  you full. They're bitter enough to decrease your  28:40blood glucose response to a meal, but not to make  you full. So there is an extract of hops, the same  28:47stuff that you would use to make beer. And this  company in New Zealand, they figured out how to  28:53extract it. It's a compound called amasarate, and  they put the capsule in a little lipid medium.29:03Ben Greenfield: You swallow it, it goes through your stomach   intact, it opens up in your small intestine, hits  all the bitter receptors without you having to  29:11taste it on your tongue because you literally like  puke, it's so bitter. And your fullness, if you  29:16do this, say like a couple of capsules an hour  before lunch, a couple capsules an hour before   dinner. Again, you don't. It's almost dangerous  because you want to enjoy your meal and you still  29:27enjoy it a little bit. But you don't think about  food. You go to bed, super full. It's almost,  29:32you know, you got to warn people, hey, be careful  not to lose too much weight, lose too much muscle,   etcetera. But those two are incredible. If,  you know, if you like me or a foodie and just  29:43go to bed thinking about food, you got to try  at least one or both of those at some point.29:49Caleb Applegate: Good to know.   Yeah. There's so many, I think, different  things to try here, and for me right now,  30:00I'm just trying to develop mental clarity  and discipline. I think it starts there.  30:06If I can change my mindset on things, to me  that's the biggest thing. And I have found  30:12personally that that's the biggest  obstacle out of the gate to conquer.30:17Ben Greenfield: Yeah. This is something I wanted   to ask you about because I know you've thought  about this a lot, coming from your background  30:23in gamification, in even community building and  accountability. What do you think is the biggest  30:31barrier? People who are listening in and they've  already heard about foam rolling your butt and   soaking oatmeal and chia seeds and taking a  GLP-1 agonist mimicking device and exogenous  30:41ketones and the Morozko cold plunge. What do you  think is the biggest barrier for people who are  30:48tuning into podcasts like this and just getting  dizzy in terms of the advice on how to implement?30:54Caleb Applegate: Yeah, it's a great   question. And I would say, and this is  just me speaking personally for myself  30:59and my family. It's information overload.  Like, where do you begin? What is it? Okay,  31:06this is the information. Why should I care? Where  does it intersect with my personal values and  31:13how I want to orient my life and how. And how I  think most people get tripped up because there's  31:19a lot of information out there. There's a lot of  influencers, brands and products and services,  31:26and where do you even begin? Right. It is,  it's just information complete overload.31:34Ben Greenfield: Guilty as charged.   So how do you think about the  information overload solution then?31:42Caleb Applegate: Yeah, I mean, this is just, again, personally   anecdotal. We have been walking this journey with  the Greenfield family and with a few other key  31:53folks like our good friend Dr. Leland Stillman,  who's been tremendous in my family's life. And  32:00through this process, we recognize that; a, we can  do better, b, there's a good chunk of information,  32:12c, how do you activate it? I think for our family,  the how has been a bit nebulous at times. It isn't  32:22always solvable by just changing up a supplement  or eating at different times or eating different  32:30portions. There are so many different variables.  And so I think this is like really good lead in to  32:36talk about the advent of what you and I have  been kind of concocting, creating, building,  32:43crafting in the background to solve these  types of problems for everyday folks like us.32:52Ben Greenfield: Yeah, yeah, I want to talk   about that for sure. But I don't want to leave  behind one thing. You mentioned Dr. Stillman.  32:57He's been on the show before. He's a genius when  it comes to the type of testing that he does,   and then the replenishment program that you start  on afterwards. What'd you learn from him? Or was  33:08there anything you found out about your body  that you changed after working with Leland? Caleb Applegate: Yeah. One thing that I really  33:14respect about Dr. Stillman is just that he's calm,  he's collected, and he doesn't panic. Right. You  33:22might have an issue or you might think you're  dying. He's like, no, you're not. And here's what  33:28we need to do. And I like that calm, disciplined,  sober-minded leadership. So it isn't just applying  33:36medical prowess or information that he has,  it's also his guidance through the process.33:43Caleb Applegate: And so I think   what he and I have talked about over the  past several years, or couple of years,  33:51is just how to make the process easier for  everyday folks. What do I mean by that?  34:00Everyone is bio custom individual. You might see  a great advertisement for the latest supplement  34:08package. Doesn't mean that you need that  though. And I think that's something I've   come to learn. Some products look incredibly  sexy and I want to try this and it's awesome.34:18Ben Greenfield: It does mean you need it if your neighbor   or your favorite biohacker or transhumanist is  taking it to live to 160, it must be, right?34:26Caleb Applegate: Exactly. But I think what   working with Dr. Stillman has shown me is that  that isn't always the case. Everybody's different.  34:35Every body is different. And so using that as  your starting point and going what's your body  34:42telling you? What data can we extract from, say a  Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis? You might have heavy  34:51metals that's creating toxicity in your body.  You might be deficient. You and I, Ben, we live  34:57in the Pacific Northwest, which means we might  not get as much vitamin D as someone that lives   down in Arizona, right? So there are variables  and factors that play into this. And so as  35:08this bio custom outlook kind of takes shape, it's  important to know that it's not one size fits all.35:17Caleb Applegate: And that's been a game   changer in our family because we would just go  with the typical supplements protocol or typical,  35:26hey, this influencer says we need this. Turns  out our chemistry might not actually need that.35:33Ben Greenfield: The HTMA, the Hair   Tissue Mineral Analysis that you mentioned.  I actually really like that. It's a perfect  35:39example of what you're talking about, right? It's  like 100, maybe a little bit more, dollar test.  35:45You get it. And a lot of people are like, well,  it only tells me minerals and toxins. It doesn't   tell me everything else, but everything from your  copper to your zinc ratios to your sodium levels,  35:54potassium levels, indicators of sympathetic  and parasympathetic nervous system balance.  35:59There is a ton that you can glean from  that one test. I actually took Leland's  36:04entire HTMA course to learn how to interpret  it better and just learned that, oh my gosh,   this is more than just like a simple hair  test for metals and toxins and minerals.36:13Ben Greenfield: Like, it goes pretty deep.   And it is kind of cool how even though you can do  like, I've interviewed the folks from Wild Health,  36:21the fancy multi-thousand dollar executive  panel and the full body mris and the full   genome analysis and the metabolomics report for  fatty acids and amino acids and micronutrients  36:32and all these things that you can do that  we, and certainly people like Dr. Stillman  36:38walk people through. The HTMA is a perfect  example of taking the seemingly complex world  36:45of self-quantification and at least trying  to introduce some amount of simplicity to it. Caleb Applegate: 100%. It gives you a baseline to build  36:52off of data is important. It's really important.  And I would say that data without overload is a  37:02great starting point. Just show me the basics  that explain how I'm feeling, maybe why I'm  37:09feeling a certain way, so that we can quickly get  into the how. How do we start to solve for this?37:16Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I mean, I know that you. It's kind   of interesting because you're unique. I may call  you an Avatar, Caleb, even though you're not blue,  37:24your unique avatar in that. You know, I met you  when you were really wanting to be healthier.  37:33You're super interested in a lot of the biohacks  that I was talking about. And for a lot of people,  37:39it is not to kick that live to 160 horse to death,  but it's not about bragging rights for living the  37:45longest time or owning the half-million dollars  worth of biohacks or whatever. It's more about  37:53having more productivity being unleashed to create  more wealth, having time available and left over  38:01after your fitness and your self-preservation  efforts for family and hobbies and career and  38:08social life, etc. And so, you know, I would  love to hear how you kind of, you know, in your  38:16situation, think about or thought about or began  to tackle this issue that you kind of ran into.38:22Ben Greenfield: At least I think   this is the way you kind of explained  to me, like, just knowing me, you know,   as my friend, you get bombarded with a lot  of information. Then once you came on at Ben  38:31Greenfield Life is just more information through  the firehose of health. And, you know, you kind  38:39of came up with some solutions or potential ways  to reduce some of that complexity and confusion.38:46Caleb Applegate: Yeah, you're absolutely right. And again,   so much of what you and I have talked about has  been anecdotal. This is me personally, my family,  38:55and our personal journey. And part of the issues  that we've hit up against time and time again is;  39:03a, there's a ton of information out there,  b, what do you do with it? And does all of  39:09it pertain to you? Right. You might see really  cool supplements, but they may not be for your  39:17bio custom individual self. And every body  is different, as we said earlier. So it's  39:23sifting through all the noise. There's a  lot of noise, but it doesn't stop there.39:28Caleb Applegate: Let's say you get down   a path with a functional medicine doctor. How do  you know if it's working? You started taking those  39:35supplements. Do you feel better? Is it placebo?  Are you really starting to see change? There's new  39:41and different ideas and opinions and things that  are always surfacing. Right. Who do you listen to?39:48Ben Greenfield: Right? Or worse yet, by the way,   because I run into this a lot, you listen to like  20 different podcasts, and you've woven through  39:56maybe like four or five different doctors, and  you've got like four shells in your pantry of  40:03all the supplements and creams and lotions and  transdermals that you started on with one person  40:08or heard about on a podcast, and now you just  kind of almost like, dizzy when you walk into   your pantry or open your refrigerator trying to  figure out what to take and what's right for you.40:19Caleb Applegate: Yeah, exactly. And the thing that you   and I have discussed a ton through this process  of my journey, my family's journey, is if that's  40:29happening with us, we can surely assume that it's  happening with a lot of other folks out there. And  40:36so as you and I started thinking through, not just  the problems, but what could potential solutions  40:44look like. We've, from the outset, been thinking  about what we're coining as the every person.  40:52Right. We think about the folks who are busy  running their kids back and forth from school  40:58and husbands going to work and trying to build a  career. We're not just talking about, you know,  41:05the elites, the top tier class A executives.  We're talking about folks, just everyday folks,  41:12who know something is off. We're trying to figure  out easy solutions for that group of folks.41:21Ben Greenfield: Yeah, it's a really good point too,   because I get this a lot. People come up to me at  conferences or at events and they're like, well,  41:27I want to get healthy, but I'm not as extreme  as you. Or they think the person I'm talking  41:33to is the elite biohacker or they have to sign  up for some super duper, admittedly expensive  41:40private VIP coaching program with me in order to  get healthy. And that's one thing that you and I  41:46have been talking about just the past few months  is I've created journeys and transformations, but  41:53they're expensive and they're one-on-one and you  got to sign up to work with me. And furthermore,  41:59like I don't even work with more than ten people  in a month, but yet we have all this information,  42:06all this content, all these connections, all  these vetted and curated companies and products,  42:14all of these, all this information. But you're a  way better architect than me, Caleb. Cause for me,  42:23you walk into my office, it's not exactly  clean, but I kind of know where everything is.   Whereas you're good at kind of  architecting a journey for someone,  42:32to so-called transformation or something, that  they might be seeking in the world of health.42:38Ben Greenfield: So when you presented   to me the idea of the next evolution of Ben  Greenfield Life, I was actually pretty excited  42:48about it. But I'd love for you to share in  your own words what you were kind of like   laying awake thinking about at night and then,  you know, voxering me about in the mornings.42:58Caleb Applegate: Well, you are correct.   You are the mad scientist, right? I go into your  zen den and you've got the coolest gadgets on the  43:06planet and they're all, like, incredible in their  own right. The question that you and I have been  43:12wrestling with is how do we take that and somehow  make that or a version of that or information,  43:19the science behind that available to all people.  And so yeah, we really started transitioning to  43:28what if. What if there was a place, one place,  not walled gardens everywhere, which you see in  43:35a lot of different spaces, especially in the  health and wellness space. What if there was   one house with lots of different rooms? Rooms  with the best products, the best curated core  43:47contributing experts in their various fields,  all in that health and wellness space. What  43:54if they could offer their services? And what  if you could build community around that? So,  43:59in essence, what if it was the public square  of all things transformation geared for you  44:07and for your desired health transformation  outcomes. Like, this is a game changer.44:12Caleb Applegate: And this was the thing that I think   you and I together identified early on is that  that didn't really exist. And the what if became,  44:22well, let's build it. Let's start putting  the pieces together. Where do we begin? And  44:27that's where the architecture really came  into place. But you've built a lifetime of  44:33incredible relationships. You've tried some  of the coolest gear on the planet, really.  44:38My job is just now building the architecture  that connects it all and threads the needle. Ben Greenfield: Early on, we were talking about podcasts,  44:46right? There's maybe somebody subscribes like  15 different health podcasts. So you have all   this information flying out there. It's not  structured. You don't know exactly what to do  44:55with it. But you have this information jumbling  around inside your head, and you're grabbing a   little bit here and a little bit there, and maybe  have a few friends who are doing the same thing,  45:04but they might listen to a few different podcasts  and have their own approach. And then from a book  45:09standpoint, you've got something like Boundless,  right, which you referred to as the Bible earlier   in the podcast. Well, that's also kind of  a cookbook full of a lot of information,  45:19but you don't necessarily open it, take your  finger, point, click, and all of a sudden be  45:24able to have a program designed for you that  leaps out from the, say, the sleep chapter or  45:32the hormones chapter or the longevity chapter.  And so what got me excited when I was talking  45:38to you early on in this process of what do we  do with all this information to actually make  45:43it accessible in a way that allows to someone,  that allows someone to actually time hack this,  45:50transform themselves, but also kind of like,  have all these experts in your back pocket,  45:55like, actually accessible to you to be able  to be like, hey, Ben, I have a question. Ben Greenfield: Hey, you know, I'm going to hop on the Wednesday  46:01AMA and ask Ben this, and it correlates directly  to the program that's been created for me that me  46:07and other members of a community are following to,  say, optimize sleep, or optimize hormones or lose  46:13fat or we're on a, you know, a transformation  challenge this month for, say, buttery hips and  46:21mobility, or whatever the case may be. So we threw  around a few ideas, but I don't remember which one  46:30of us or a team member or whatever came up with  the idea of, like, a network? We bandied about a  46:38few terms, but really what we've settled on is  this idea of a life network, right? All things  46:46life optimization within one network that's not  expensive, that consolidates all this information,  46:55that gives you access to your favorite experts  and also gives you a roadmap to follow and a  47:01community to support you and have fun with  you along that journey of transformation.47:08Caleb Applegate: Yeah, no, beautifully   said. Here's the thing. I've spent years  and years and years designing products,  47:15experiences using gamification, really  digging into usability, engineering this  47:21next chapter of my life together with you and  the tremendous team at Ben Greenfield Life.  47:28We want to help you design your outcomes,  design your transformation outcomes. This  47:34is about you and your journey. Again, so much  of this was anecdotal for me and my family,  47:40right? I ignored, ignored, ignored. Now I'm  like information overload. How do I distill  47:47it and create act real action orientation around  it? Not just I'm going to get a gym membership,  47:54not just I'm going to try to get a little bit  more sleep or that's a cool supplement over there.48:00Caleb Applegate: We want you to connect with things that are going   to create real, lasting, both short and long-term  true transformation. So it's, yeah, Life Network  48:10is, I think, it's the future. I think it takes the  power of data tracking with wearables and a lot  48:18of the cool products that are out there. And it  also lets us, like, that's a foundational building  48:23block. It allows us to use that data coupled with  real community data points. Like, how did you  48:32participated in a challenge? You did that workout.  Who's tracking that? And one of the beautiful  48:38things with Life Network is that we emphasize four  key things: mind, body, spirit, and community.48:46Caleb Applegate: These are the things that we've identified   as our core pillars. What if you could have, this  goes back to the what if, right? What if you could  48:54have a life performance score, more holistic view?  Not just how you slept or your HRV, but looking  49:03at the whole picture of things. So really, life  network becomes a health tracking concierge team.49:11Ben Greenfield: I'm doing it right now,   by the way, Caleb, I'm wearing the Life Network  branded ultra human ring. I think you have one,  49:17too. Yeah, that's just like a sneak peek.  If people are watching the video, it's at  49:22bengreenfieldlife.com/applegate. Literally, blood  glucose, sleep, blood and biomarkers, activity,  49:29HRV, meditation sessions, breath work, coaching,  all built into one beautiful curated ring,  49:36right? That's available to our members. Rinse,  wash, and repeat that with your sauna and cold  49:42plunge package, with your home environmental  optimization package, etc. And it's kind of funny,  49:47Caleb, because, well, inside baseball for folks,  we have these really fun annual Ben Greenfield  49:55Life team retreats where we bring the whole team  together. And I crafted a vision two years ago  50:02at the team retreat in which I described how,  probably because I'm kind of like a content  50:07junkie and autodidact, I love to digest all this  information from the healthosphere and then turn   around and figure out a way to package  that and make it palatable for people.50:17Ben Greenfield: I architect, or I describe the   vision of like a podcast network, right? What if  we took what we've done with me and then we have,  50:27you know, we're generating revenue from ads,  but we've got the mommy endurance runner,  50:34and the swimmer, and the weightlifter, and  the biohacker, and the nutrition junkie, etc.,  50:41etc. And that was kind of sort of a cool idea. But  you really showed me that people don't need just a  50:51bunch more content, right? They need an actual  journey, and they need it structured in such  50:57a way that they actually have a plan to follow.  And yet, I actually am excited about the content  51:05part of the Life Network, too, because we have  taken this idea of podcasters, albeit ad free,  51:13hooray, within the Life Network. But tell me  about the idea of the actual content in there,  51:18especially like the podcast, AMA,  audio, video, learning type of stuff.51:24Caleb Applegate: Yeah, I think you hit on some really important   things here. One thing that I will highlight is  the thing that I'm the most excited about is,  51:34to your point, what do you do with all this  information? What our family needed, what I needed  51:40was movement. Constant movement. Forward, one step  at a time. Movement. In community. And then how do  51:49you take that information to make better informed  decisions about yourself, your health patterns,  51:55and then how can you contribute back into  the community? It's a beautiful flywheel,   actually. When we look at the content inside of  Life Network, it has a communal aspect to it.  52:07It's very dynamic. Instead of I'm reading this and  it's transactional, here's what I mean by that.52:13Caleb Applegate: You don't just jump into Life Network and you're   met with a bunch of different articles or some  of Ben's beautifully produced, epic masterclass  52:24course content. It is that, but it's so much more.  You mentioned shows, so we have a show, a weekly  52:31show called Triumph Weekly. This is the summary  of all things happening on the network. Everything  52:38from, we've got this VIP cooking event coming  up. Members only. There's 50 spots, this Friday.52:46Caleb Applegate: Make sure you don't forget   to join. Set your timer and be first in line.  We've got different core-contributing experts  52:55that we'll bring onto the Triumph Weekly Show. And  this is only like a 10 to 15 minutes show. Think   of it like a news anchor. Kind of like, here's all  things happening in the networks. Because it's a  53:04community. We want to celebrate wins. We want  to highlight achievements. Even if you didn't  53:12win a challenge, the fact that you participated,  you just got there is a win in and of itself. We  53:21will have challenges. We'll have different  shows. We have our new team, Team Triumph.53:27Ben Greenfield: RAW. We have RAW. Caleb Applegate: Right? Right. Go   ahead. You talk about RAW. This is your thing.53:34Ben Greenfield: Okay, I'll talk about   Rob. By the way, you were mentioning  Team Triumph. Many of you were on the  53:39ladder platform where you're following my  workouts. For those of you who missed that,   that's all going to be in Life Network now  as part of Team Triumph. So you get your  53:50daily workouts. I'll let Caleb and a little bit  tell you about the super slick interface. Like,   we have not messed around as far as the interface  goes and the usability. But part of this,  54:00too is like, I have thoughts sometimes when I'm  interviewing a guest, I only have so much time.54:07Ben Greenfield: Typically there's an hour to an hour and 15   minutes allotted for me to interview somebody. I  often keep my mouth shut when I disagree or when I  54:17want to argue back at a point. I often have things  I want to share post-show that are on my mind that  54:24I don't get a chance to share just cause there's  only so much time in the day. And a lot of times I   have things that I know I want the guests to talk  about that we just don't have time to get to. If  54:33I'm constantly interrupting them and arguing and  pushing back and sharing my own thoughts, etc.   You guys listen to the podcast, you probably hear  that I try not to talk over the guests too much.54:43Ben Greenfield: I also have things that   I want to talk about that go way beyond the twice  monthly Q&A's that I do like. Tons of tips from,  54:53gosh, the RAW episodes or everything from things  I'm doing for big toe and low back mobility, to  55:00new family and relationship habits, to different  ways I've been tapping into some of the appetite  55:07control stuff Caleb and I were talking about  earlier. I wanted an ad free platform where I  55:14could just talk to you like you and me having  a phone conversation where, hey, here's the. I   actually have some clients who will do this to me.  Like, they'll pay for a consultation and they'll  55:23lead off the consultation with. So, Ben, tell  me what you haven't been talking about in the   podcast. Tell me about the new things you've  discovered lately that are working for you.55:32Ben Greenfield: And basically, like my podcast and the Life   Network, the RAW show, is just that. It's quick,  it's edgy, it's me. It's like 30 minutes long,  55:43and it's literally just my chance to, to share  the stuff that I just don't get a chance to   share with you on this normal podcast feed, the  one you're listening to right now, in an ad free  55:53environment with the ability for you to be able  to interact with me within that environment.  55:59We're talking like AMA's forums, not just me,  but the other experts within the platform.  56:04I'm pretty excited about The RAW Podcast,  Caleb. It's been fun to record the first few. Caleb Applegate: I know, and you're crushing it. It's  56:11amazing because you're right. You have so much in  your orbit that's happening. All the crazy stuff  56:17that you get introduced to, the people that you  get to meet. I'm personally really excited about  56:23RAW with Ben Greenfield because it is, it's like  meeting Oz behind the curtain. So it's going to be  56:29super fun. So we've got RAW, we've got Triumph  Weekly. We've got several other shows that are  56:36already in production that will launch post-MVP of  Life Network, which we are hoping for-August ish.  56:45Around that timeline, we'll be doing a friends  and family release of that. We also, Team Triumph,  56:52like you mentioned. But this is the biggest thing  I think I'm the most excited about. We're going  56:57to be hosting debates. Do you want to talk for  a minute about this? Because this was really,  57:03this was your brainchild, and I know we've  kind of ideated together, but this is so cool.57:10Ben Greenfield: Okay, so this is something.   It's kind of like herding cats for me. But I've  got some really good debates that I'm going to be  57:19moderating. I got Sean Baker and Joel Green doing  carnivore versus omnivore. I have a doctor who  57:26hates stem cells debating a doctor who is super  into stem cells. I'm doing seed oils are bad  57:33versus seed oils are good. Just about, you know,  keto versus, you know, a high carb diet is better  57:40for the thyroid and for metabolism, anything  that you've heard on two different podcasts  57:46and you wish those people would just step into  like celebrity death match and go at each other.57:52Ben Greenfield: We're doing that within   the Life's Network. So basically juicy, juicy  debates on all the topics related to health,  58:01nutrition, fitness, biohacking. So  that's kind of another cool feature. Caleb Applegate: Yeah, 100%. And there is  58:09no other platform that's going to spotlight  conversation like this. Like X is great,  58:16but it's such a generalized public square. What  we're aiming to create here is a safe place  58:25around health, wellness and life optimization. So  conversation movements in community, we're here  58:31together. And then you and I, it doesn't just  stop there. We have really exciting plans to  58:36take this digital environment and kind of touch it  down locally, practically. So lots of cool stuff.58:42Caleb Applegate: We'll have our own   merchandise line that we're dropping with some  really epic, like Triumph t-shirts. We've got,  58:49I mean, the list goes on and on. I cannot wait  for the public to see this and experience it. The  58:55other thing that I want to highlight here, because  we've talked about, what are some of the cool  59:00things inside the Network. But one of the biggest  things that just to be transparent for a minute,  59:09that you and I have talked about is making  this accessible and affordable for everybody,  59:15right? Looking at the health and wellness space,  there's some just incredible products out there.  59:21Our desire, though, and I think our family's  desire, is to make sure that every person on  59:29the planet has access to this. Which means it  needs to be ultra affordable, right? We have  59:37operating costs, there's a baseline fee, but we've  put this thing at 16.99 a month. 16.99 a month.59:44Ben Greenfield: $16. Not 1,699. $16.99.59:50Caleb Applegate: That's exactly   right. Which is a game changer. It  doesn't exist in this space. Right?59:56Ben Greenfield: And look, by the way,   folks, I kind of like, let's not beat around  the bush. I own Ben Greenfield Life. It's how  1:00:03I feed my family. And when Caleb came to me, he's  like, we can do this at $16.99 a month. I'm like,  1:00:10oh, I don't know if we're going to actually  generate any meaningful revenue from that,  1:00:18but it's really about a lot of people in the  community. We want to build a massive tribe  1:00:26and a network. And sure there's things within  the Life Network. Like if you join for $16.99,  1:00:32you're not going to get like the $400 ring, right?  Like we make certain things accessible within  1:00:37the Life Network that you then get access to as a  member that you can't get unless you're a member.1:00:42Ben Greenfield: But all the content,   all the podcasts, all the debates, all the  community, all the Team Triumph workouts,  1:00:49all of the forums, everything is $16.99 a month.1:00:55Caleb Applegate: Yeah. It is your one-stop home,   your family, your community of like minded  individuals who are wanting the exact same  1:01:05thing. And that is to feel better and take that  desire and contribute back into the community.  1:01:12Pour back into the community. Somebody asked  me, or I've been asked several times recently,  1:01:19what are you expecting in terms of  users? And this is really important,   and I do feel compelled to share this. I've  said this over and over and over again. If we  1:01:30get 50 people out of the gate, I want to make  sure those 50 people are loved on so much and  1:01:38that they are experiencing real outcomes and feel  valued, that they want to tell 50 other people,  1:01:46so on and so forth. Our goal is to make this  boutique experience be the best, most world class  1:01:55experience on the planet, where you're not just  getting information, but you're getting engaged.1:02:02Ben Greenfield: Yeah. Yeah. And it's consolidated   and curated. I want to tell a story to drive  my point home. When I first started my podcast,  1:02:10this was like 17 years ago, right? This was before  River and Terran were born. That I was this,  1:02:15you know, freckle-faced personal trainer with a,  af you go back and find episode one, super high  1:02:22pitched voice, you know, skinny kids sitting in  the gym, opening up my age old computer with the  1:02:32computer camera turned on, talking into the camera  and like, thumbing through strength conditioning   journals and research. It was like 17 episodes  in when I interviewed my first official guest.1:02:43Ben Greenfield: I think it was Angela   Nath. Shout out to Angela. I think she  still listens to the show. Professional   cyclist and triathlete. There was maybe like  Gillian Michaels, Dave Asprey, Rob Wolf.  1:02:56I think Joe Rogan had a podcast. I don't remember,  but there were less than 100 podcasts, period.  1:03:03This is where you had to hard code your RSS feed  to Apple, wait two weeks for it to get accepted.1:03:10Ben Greenfield: If it was over something stupid,   like 100 megabytes, if any line of code was messed  up, your podcast would disappear. And this was  1:03:20like the dinosaur days of podcasting.  Well, kind of like blogging, you know,  1:03:25in the way that blogging transformed from the late  90s to the mid 2000s, you know, podcasting from  1:03:31the early 2000s to present day. Even if you just  talk about, like, health and fitness, podcasts  1:03:37has absolutely blown up. There are thousands  and thousands of podcasts which means a stream  1:03:45of information that you could listen to all day  long at 4x speed that you still would not be able  1:03:52to get through listening 7 days a week. So one of  the ways I think about the Life Network is what if  1:04:00it was all consolidated and curated, and all you  had to do was open the Life Network and just have  1:04:05those podcasts? Like, that's all the information  you need. We split it. Mind, body, spirit.1:04:11Ben Greenfield: You've got all the advice you need. I'm looking   over everything. I'm vetting all the guests,  I'm vetting all the experts. It's an ad free  1:04:18environment. Yeah, I mean, I don't want to shoot  myself in the foot here. You're still going to get   a lot of value out of this podcast that you're  listening to right now. But imagine if you were  1:04:26listening to this podcast. Let's say something  about, I don't know, haptic therapy for sleep.1:04:32Ben Greenfield: And you could actually go   within the Life Network and on the weekly AMA say,  hey Ben, how come you didn't ask the guests XYZ,  1:04:39and are you actually using ABC? Right. You can  actually interact with me within the Life Network  1:04:45in a much more personal way. And not just me,  but all these other experts and podcasters,   by the way, many of which you're going to be  familiar with when you join the Life Network.  1:04:53You're going to be blown away by the people we  have in there. But the way I think about it is   in an era of information overload, why not just  cut to the chase, get the stuff you want, and  1:05:05be supported by a community and experts who are  ensuring you get the most out of that information.1:05:13Caleb Applegate: Yeah, very well said. Ben Greenfield: Yeah, I agree. Simplicity, affordability,  1:05:19accessibility and just a world class experience  making it simple for people to understand  1:05:26what they need and what they  need to get in community.1:05:32Ben Greenfield: Caleb, I'm sure   people are wondering, and this is probably the  dumbest thing I've ever said on my podcast,  1:05:39but I don't remember what the  URL is for the Life Network. Caleb Applegate: Golifenetwork.com.  1:05:44We're not live yet. We're almost there. Ben Greenfield: We might be by the time this podcast comes out. Caleb Applegate: We might be. This  1:05:51is the beautiful thing. We're not promising  the future. We've built it. It's functional,  1:05:56it works. We have an active, pretty big dev  team working on this, doing an incredible job.  1:06:02Our entire team is filling this platform, this  network, with all sorts of incredible content,  1:06:09all the way from our coaching team, to our  partnerships team, to podcasts and all these  1:06:14new shows that we're creating again. Shout  out to our amazing team at Ben Greenfield  1:06:19Life. But everybody is incorporating into their  daily rhythms just content and contributions  1:06:26into the network. So this thing is going to be  rocking. I cannot wait to unveil it to the world.1:06:32Ben Greenfield: Yeah. And then a huge amount   of gratefulness to you, Caleb, because as you guys  listening and heard, we're talking like, you know,  1:06:41mineplex engine passages, taking all this  knowledge of how to make a slick user interface  1:06:50that's accessible, that's gamified, that's fun,  that doesn't break every hour while you're on it,  1:06:56and then marry that to the best of  the best. From health, from fitness,   from biohacking, from longevity, nutrition,  supplementation, etc. This is where, Caleb,  1:07:05you came in at a really clutch point, like being  able to actually pull this off from a technical  1:07:13standpoint. And for all you listening in, I know  we're getting a little long in the tooth here,   so we'll wrap up pretty soon, but you have to  see what this experience is like. And I mean,  1:07:23you heck, just like, you know, when  it's ready, go join. You don't,   you don't have to stay in if you don't want  to. Although I, I doubt that will be the case.1:07:30Ben Greenfield: But if you just want to surf around, see   what it looks like. Golifenetwork.com. And I mean,  yeah, I was even showing my wife and kids and  1:07:38they're like, wow, this is really professional.  This looks really good. And you don't see  1:07:44that a lot in the health and fitness space.  Something that's beautiful, but that also works.1:07:50Caleb Applegate: Yeah. I was on with one of our newly onboarded   core-contributing experts that probably so many  folks listening to the Ben Greenfield Life podcast  1:08:02would instantly recognize. And she, she was blown  away. And she said, and I quote, you have no idea  1:08:11how this is going to change lives. This is the  most beautiful platform I have ever seen in this  1:08:18space, end quote. And that was really encouraging  from a guy who doesn't come from the health and  1:08:23wellness space to be able to take my background,  kind of the culmination of everything that I've  1:08:29learned, intersect that with your expertise,  your relationships, all the knowledge base that  1:08:36you bring in and mash that all together, is really  exciting to see all of that come to life. So I am,  1:08:44man, I couldn't be more thrilled. Thank you  for the opportunity for believing in this   and allowing us this opportunity to release a  platform that will help change people's lives.1:08:55Ben Greenfield: Well, if you're listening in,   you know that I'm moving to Idaho. It just  so happens I'm moving about 20 minutes away  1:09:02from Caleb. So we're gonna keep building, keep  architecting, keep creating beautiful things that  1:09:08will change your life and transform you. And  the Life Network is now the hub for that.
