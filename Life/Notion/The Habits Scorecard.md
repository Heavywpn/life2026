  

==**Become more aware of your behaviour:**==

1. ==**Make a list of your daily habits**==
2. ==**If it’s a good habit write a +**  
    **If it’s a bad habit write a -**  
    **If it’s a neutral habit write a =**==
3. ==**Categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run**==

  

==**The marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation and goals. (bulking vs cutting)**==

  

==**Generally speaking good habits will have net positive outcomes, bad habits have net negative outcomes**==

  

==**If you’re having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, just ask yourself: “Does this behaviour help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?**==

  

==**Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good.**  
**Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.**==

  

==**Observe your thoughts and actions without judgement or internal criticism.**  
**Don’t blame yourself for your faults.**  
**Don’t praise yourself for your successes.**==

  

==**Acknowledge your habits almost as if you were watching someone else**==

  

==**The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them.**==

  

==**If you feel like you need extra help, then try pointing-and-calling your habits. Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be.**==

  

==**Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real. It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into an old routine**==

  

> ==**The process of behaviour change always starts with awareness**==

  

==**Strategies like pointing-and-calling and the Habits Scorecard are focused on getting you to recognize your habits and acknowledge the cues that trigger them, which makes it possible to respond in a way that benefits you**==
