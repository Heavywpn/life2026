- **Solomon Islands:**

Our club members have been actively involved in sorting and packing items for these shipments, demonstrating their commitment to our international service efforts.

Additionally, Ricky Prout continues to work with PNG IMR and the Malaria Research team on their IT systems upgrade. We are also researching for Microscope repair options to help the lab with their equipment needs.

I want to express my gratitude to all club members who have contributed their time and effort to these projects. Your dedication is making a real difference in communities around the world.

Respectfully submitted,

Kristyn Prout

International Director
