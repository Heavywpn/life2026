Transcipt: "Jason intros Travis Kalanick0:00the reason that he was kicked out is because of this toxic culture some big0:05news that took place on Christmas Eve if you missed it Travis kenck planning to leave the board at Uber and when he0:12showed me what he was working on I immediately said hey can I invest a popular 70 billion doll ride sharing company is searching for a new CEO to0:19take the wheel so you want to talk about structure being completely screwy competition is good I'll bet my entire0:26network that Uber will be here and thriving in 10 years you're you're at War prematurely with your customers0:33sorry about [Music] that all right0:42[Applause] everybody my0:49guy um uh I can't believe I can't believe I get to sit down with one of the most0:56famous investors in Uber I'm honored I'm honored to be1:02here um we we wanted to have a surprise for you every day uh I've been you know1:09Travis and I have been friends for 25 years um the first time I interviewed Travis was 1999 I was doing a little1:16magazine out here digital Coast reporter you were doing a little company called scour um which was a peer-to-peer1:22Network to share files um and you were 22 years old I was1:2728 I think if we put those two numbers together just don't let people do the math you know it's just like just keep1:32moving was a while ago 1999 um and um I1:38just remember the enthusiasm drive and fire that you had at that time and it always1:45struck me I said to myself I don't know if he's going to win on this one I'm pretty sure he's going to get his ass1:50handed to him in fact correct correct um but I know this guy's going to win big1:56in the future and and sure enough uh we got to go on a great journey together with Uber and now again with Cloud2:02kitchens and I every year when we're hanging out I say since you left Uber I say you know2:08whenever you're ready let's have a conversation and here we are and then you call me every year I call you every year if you're ready just and I'm just a2:16block away from you you're Alma moer UCLA let's go come on I'm like all right let's let's go and2:24this year you said okay so here we are um let's chop it up let's talk about Cloud kitchens you have since uh youWhat Travis is working on at Cloud Kitchens2:32left Uber been working extremely hard and quietly on cloud kitchens what is2:38the vision what is cloud kitchens for people who don't know well uh2:44so yeah I mean it it is kind of funny when you go from being a tech guy to a kitchen guy I mean that's interesting um2:51look food has I think we all know like food is it's at the center of the Human2:58Experience the center of humanity and just just how we live but it's got a lot of3:03problems Health cost convenience like all that stuff and it could be a hell of3:12a lot better and so um of course in my last at my last gig we did Uber Eats it3:20was a starting point but the difference with food versus rides is that the3:25infrastructure was already there you had a bunch of cars that were 98% unutilized and so you just had to light it up but3:32to do food right you needed to build the infrastructure and so the mission for3:38our company is infrastructure for better food and the idea is like can you get3:44the preparation and delivery of food so high quality and most importantly so3:51cost efficient that it starts to approach the cost of you going to the grocery store if that happens you do to3:57the kitchen what Uber did to the car and so the quiet part is like we go and4:04buy real estate we do construction we then go talk to the4:11center point of what matters in food which is the restaurant tour the entrepreneur who's making it who does it4:20just because I mean it's a labor of love you got to have a deep passion for food and a deep passion for people because4:26otherwise you couldn't survive in that world uh but these guys are like like true blue entrepreneurs and they are our4:32customer and you do it from their perspective and you help them get their4:38vision for what they're doing out there and do it super super efficiently um and4:44so we like to say we serve those who serve others we're not the restaurant we're the guys4:49underneath and uh currently I think we have real estate we we have facilities4:54in all the major cities in 30 countries around the world um we also have a5:00software division so we have hundreds of thousands of restaurants using our software stack um and we have a robotics5:06division um that you know got going with a lot of the original sort of uber atg5:12guys Advanced Technology Group the the autonomy guys so we got that crew together and um have really you know5:20robots that are going to that already are out there but are going to5:26be out there in a really big way over the coming you know quarters and years so the premise of uber was hey press a5:34button we move you or anything from point A to point B what a profound5:39simple but profound um insight as an entrepreneur and the Insight here is5:45hey getting you food uh quickly efficiently and then making it easier5:51for a restaurant tour to pop up a restaurant tell us the economics of a food brand um when Jade and I and the5:59family were out here here on vacation over the summer at Manhattan Beach we had a wonderful experience of ordering6:04gwenneth Pal's Cloud kitchen and these new brands great um yeah great great new6:10brands popping up um talk about the economics for that food entrepreneur I6:15mean It's just tough I think most of us know a restaurant tour some of us may have even tried to do a restaurant or be6:22a part of it in some fashion I like I said it's a labor of love but like your6:27big costs are going to be labor let's call it between you know let's call it6:3230% but it can range from like 25 to 40% of your overall Revenue occupancy which6:38is the the physical space itself uh let's call it between six and 12% of6:46Revenue uh supply chain is 30% uh marketing let's call it 10 um I6:52know I'm missing something somewhere but those are the that's the big stuff and a successful restaurant's going to have a6:5910 % profit margin and be really pumped about that wow um and so yeah that's7:05just how it works um you know one thing I wanted to say just sort of the high level to like sort of how do you connect7:10the dots on like sort of where Innovation is going is that um you know my sweet spot is digitizing the physical7:17world and you know you could take that to mean a lot of different things but7:22it's basically treating atoms like bits and so we know the bits world is a7:28computer okay computers well CPU manipulates the bits storage stores the7:33bits Network moves bits from point A to point B but if you're treating atoms7:39like bits you go CPU manipulates the bits what manipulates atoms that's7:45manufacturing storage stores bits what stores atoms that's Real Estate Network7:52moves bits from point A to point B what uh yeah what moves atoms well7:59that's transport of logistics and so these are the three sort of core8:05Computing resources in a atoms based computer and you can say my last gig was8:11so much about the network for the physical world but there's just a huge8:16amount of innovation left in compute and storage for the physical world also8:22known as digitized manufacturing and digitized real estate and so our company is really8:29sort of building atoms based computers and sort of our first computer is really a food8:36computer so that's kind of how we think about it yeah um let's take a look at the video of um some of the robots uh8:44that are making food in Cloud kitchens8:49[Music]8:59and that's our lab we're doing that in house all in house yeah all this stuff is in house9:05[Music]9:22[Applause] [Music]9:44so we call this part like look ma no hands right so once the dispensers are full of9:50food nobody touches it and what comes out on a conveyor belt is bags of food that get delivered amazing right so you9:58know LED bag sealed you get the general idea so now you have a a restaurant that can10:06asynchronously produce for consumers from what labor is doing and the labor10:11is primarily on the on the prep side of things so we see there's kind of vessels10:17there um I'm assuming they have ingredients in them the bowl goes by stuff gets dropped in organized covered10:25put in a bag label goes on the human has no part in that except for maybe10:31preparing and and filling prep let's say you have prep in the morning this machine can run for hours without10:37anybody there um and so you know there's interesting you know so so it just10:43becomes a more efficient thing so the if you want to do to the kitchen what Uber10:49did to the car you have to make sure two things happen one is that you need the10:54logistics the movement of food needs to go to the cost of that needs to go to zero this is a autonomous vehicles11:00things along these lines and then the production of food must also get uh sort of roboticized mechanized essentially11:08those two things happen and then we can always cook but it can be out of choice11:15and um you know I like to say I like a I I like horses but I don't ride a horse to work and so um you can get higher11:23quality food to the people at a lower cost and just give people the most precious of commodities11:29back which is called time to do all the things all the other things in life that they love and you're strategically11:37placing these Cloud kitchens um in I get I would assume very11:42lowcost real estate but that's at very key uh locations that make it very11:49efficient to uh deliver the food yeah yeah so on the software side we we have11:56a software stack that like I said hundreds of of thousands of restaurants use we're seeing 18% of all online12:04delivery in the US as an example our software is touching so because we see12:09where all of the delivery is we know where to put a delivery only restaurant12:16facility um and so we find distressed real estate or sort of unique situations12:22where it's hard to develop and we've built a competence in sort of turning that into a 30 kitchen facility that we12:30then lease those kitchens to restaurant tours let's talk about the Playbook this is something you worked on really hardTravis's operating playbook12:37at Uber hiring Josh in New York will in La we had a podcast and you were set on12:44that podcast years and years ago hey I'm looking for some people to run some cities to run Uber and you found this12:49eclectic group of Samurai and you let12:54them go um and man they cooked yeah talk to me about that management principle13:01and your management principles hey be pumped you know and and bringing that enthusiasm that fire and letting those13:08cities cook because most people have this top down they do things sequentially you've really and and in13:15those early days got more and more emboldened and excited about doing things in parallel and letting people13:21make mistakes in those regions and learning they could I remember Josh started doing messenger delivery you let13:28other people deliver kittens for a day to an office to that was a funny thing yeah JD Vance that's when he uninstalled13:34Uber um no kittens um but cookies whatever it was ice cream trucks yeah13:41talk about that model of letting you know a th flowers bloom letting these Samurai go crazy so look we had a a13:50cultural value at Uber called let Builders build and I'm sure it was there are other companies that I think may13:56have said that before us uh but we we certainly took a hold of that and look as it related to our GM model and and14:04how to empower GMS to do well it starts with who is the person and we I always14:10felt that the the magic making happens when you cross uh sort14:16of uh creative instincts with analytical capabilities or prowess14:23really so we would just design tests that sort of simulated what it would be14:28like working together that tested their creative stuff their secret their secret14:36sauce and creativity but would create problems where it was crossed with the necessity to analytically solve problems14:45got it and so you put those two things together with a hungry person that maybe14:50just got out their MBA or let's say equivalent and they're fired up and14:55ready to go and you Empower them and then you put very simple controls to make sure that15:05they're check that like like like waypoints that in order to go further they have to pass that test once they're15:12in the job and just simple things like we would have a pricing call in the early days of uber where you cannot put15:20it up in the app until you pass the pricing call the first 30 cities I was on that pricing call and the thing about15:27price when it comes to Transportation it's a amalgamation of all strategy across everything across what does your15:34cars look like what's the supply the supply uh what does uh what does Metro15:40or public uh public transport look like what is cost of Labor in that City uh what are their General alternatives for15:47getting around what are regulations like ultimately becomes a service with a price you pass that and then you run you15:55get to run a city but that means the previous 30 days or 90 days when they're just doing lots16:02of stuff I don't have to worry and then they get to that point they pass the16:07test they know what the criteria for passing the test is so it forces them16:13into the right mode right let's talk about strategy you know one of the greatStrategy at Uber: Competing with Lyft, surge pricing, dealing with bad press16:19privileges of of getting to be involved you know in your journey for a little bit was we would talk sometimes late at16:26night weekends uh when there were really dicey strategy moments and I'd ask you16:32what you're thinking and we would just jam out and a couple of those conversations I remember calling you in16:38a panic after having taken a lift a ride chair and we were only Uber black yeah16:44and I said trais I just got out of this thing it's $16 it would have been 60 I'm pricing sensitive but man16:51this is going to change everything and you're like jakow and I said don't you don't understand J no this is disrup and16:57you said we're launching it next week we got it you know it is disruptive and you saw you know the the Lincoln Town Cars17:05were so brilliant you know because there were such high margins but you saw the disruptiveness of of the rering thing17:11and then surge pricing we had a big debate about tipping let's talk about some of those seminal moments in product17:18design yeah and competition because this was not happening in a vacuum people forget17:24there was sidecar there was lift yeah and then there were Regulators this was a war yeah so I mean kind of a funny17:32story I'm not sure if I've ever told you this you were you were only six weeks behind Zuck right which is I first heard17:39about Lyft from Zuck H and he's like yo17:46yo I think you have a situation on your hands and like Su would sort of do that like with like a little with you17:52kind of sit yeah kind of like that yeah he's he's a puck yeah and I'm like thank18:00you and um but the thing was was look it was at the beginning that was like they18:07called their rides donation it was a donation thing it was non-commercial18:14because there was no insurance there was no regulation there was basically just18:20citizen giving another citizen a ride across town and we didn't do anything about it for 9 months because we were18:27already getting our asses hand handed to us and we were doing the legal thing and so I'm like dude like we're we got like18:34I got threatened by the city of San Francisco and the state of California 3 months after we launched Uber with 9018:39days in jail for every ride that had occurred yeah so then this thing is like18:46it's a donation I swear and by the way if you don't give the donation they suggest then you get kicked off the18:51system yeah right so we're like H we're not going to do that and we saw Lyft18:56eating our market share up from the bottom up because they didn't have19:01insurance or regulation or any of these other things and then nine months into19:07it uh the city of San Francisco the state of California because it's was a California pu said ah you know it's19:14totally fine and then we're like oh so then we hustled got our thing going which is19:22called would at the time was called peer-to-peer ride sharing right um and then just got working and um um the way19:29we did it was like the reason we didn't do it in the first place is because it was clearly not like legit and but then19:37California said yes and so I made a PCT with myself that was like I'm never going to let this happen again and so19:44each and every city we went to we would send we would wait for Lift to launch19:51and then we would basically say to the city we'd send them a letter saying there's this really cool thing called ride sharing this company called lft is19:57doing it um we think it's great but our read of your regs is like it's probably not20:05allowed because you're thoughtful you want to be thoughtful but if you don't20:12enforce in the next 30 days we're going to participate as well great so almost20:18every city in the US other than two we can talk about those two by the way but in all every city in the US other than20:24two Portland Vegas we were number two in R20:30sharing um be for this reason um and we did this actually internationally we did it across Europe20:36we did it everywhere there were other folks that were out there and we would talk to the regulatory guys say if you're going to enforce do it but if20:42you're not we're going to participate yeah and that work that's kind of how we rolled and surch pricing was an interesting one you know um the20:51Brilliance of the of the Uber Marketplace was in many ways tackling20:58demand and figuring out a way to get uh drivers to come out on New Year's Eve21:05the worst night of their lives to drive and you came up with a pretty novel approach which is hey we'll21:12pay you double we'll pay you triple yeah and if you don't want to participate in that as a customer that's fine but we21:18think availability is more important uh than necessarily having standardized21:24pricing and man the world got very very upset at this and you and I talked about when you21:30explained it to me I said that makes logical sense and I said you know what we should do we should write a blog post and that blog post is still up I think21:36where you just explained it to people I thought Uber took down all my blog posts they probably yeah that might be a little but this blog post where you just21:42said hey here's how to handle New Year's Eve leave at this time go back at this time but we need to get these people on21:49the road and they deserve to be compensated so surge pricing there's another way to say it21:54now I called it surge pricing on purpose because I didn't want any body to think we were trying to deceive them right so22:03we said surge pricing like it's clear what's going on um but the other way to say surge pricing is called the lowest22:11cost reliable ride because if surge pricing goes up22:17too much then you have drivers that aren't making any money um and by the way they'll go to the22:23competition but if surge pricing is exactly at and by the way if surge pricing is not enough you're not not going to be able to get a ride because22:29too many people are going to want it and there won't be enough cars sech price in the right spot it draws enough Supply22:36in and fends off enough customers and the market clears so it's the lowest22:43cost reliable ride and that's why we knew it was a winner even when all of the competition and the world generally22:50was like hating on this idea anytime we were doing surge pricing and22:56our competitor wasn't we knew we were gaining market share because somebody could just come to us and get a ride when in the other system they couldn't23:04so you're proving reliability you're proving it's the lowest cost reliable ride that's it yeah um take me to you23:14know real quick led to a massive super interesting Logistics23:22cross with economics problem where at the peak I mean and I don't know what it23:27is at Uber today but it was like I don't know like 150 phds working on this23:34problem that we just described huh inside the company yeah which is like how do you find that lowest cost23:41reliable ride is a very very difficult problem in a live Logistics system like23:47this let's talk about Regulators in relation to people being independent contractors this is when I realized the23:54Press was acting without good faith data or logic and as24:00a former journalist you know it was kind of eye openening to me to be on the other side of the table and watching24:06this happened because we knew full well based on driver data that they loved24:11their jobs at Uber because they had Free Will and they could go and do any other24:16job they wanted and let's be clear the average Uber driver during my you know let's say at the end of my tenure was24:23eight hours a week so they clearly like it clearly a side gig yeah side hustle24:29and they wanted the flexibility over everything else work24:35when I want don't work when I want and then these24:40Union politicians and everything said no and the people who own the medallions and this is a cobal of really bad actors24:48who were saying no they have to work a shift and they have to go work for somebody who owns a medallion who gets24:5550 60 70% of the economics and they portrayed us or you as the bad guy in25:01all this and this was the exact opposite of the truth so um yeah I mean it was a union25:10problem which is it's very difficult to organize people who in this classic area25:18which is very Union organized called drivers it's very difficult to organize25:24them when they choose when they want to work their office is their own it's25:29their own like nobody controls it like there there's just no control and so25:35other than the control given to the individual and so it was very disruptive to the union and their own25:42business model and so they had to cut it off at the knees and so that became a25:50mix of a sort of political discourse and like a media push crossed with sort of25:58of regulatory uh lobbying and like like26:03trying to make political apparatuses do what's necessary to constrain it and you26:10took the approach we will fight there are wartime CEOs there are peacetime CEOs I put you in the category with ElonBeing a \"War time CEO\" and competing in China26:17of wartime CEOs who it does not matter how many battles you must battle26:24concurrently we're going to fight because it's we're on the right side yeah of History yeah uh but this became26:32acute the number of battles yeah that you had to fight the number of fronts26:37increase take us to the darkest peak of it because every time I talked to you I felt fine about it but26:44other investors other people felt like hey this is too many battles to wage at once talk to me about you personally26:52fighting all those battles I my perception of you was the more battles emerged Yeah the more you realized you27:00were doing the right thing it filled your bucket it powered you it gave energy to you to know we were on the27:07right side so yeah I you know sort of in justest I would I would say to folks I'd27:13be like so you know I'm not sure how it became so27:19controversial that one citizen giving another citizen aide across town became27:25such a thing I I'm not sure how that happened but it did uh the darkest moment I me the thing is is like you'd27:32keep it was almost like we were always pushing into that27:38area so like if something became easy then we'd push elsewhere until that27:43became hard so it was constant is like I make the analogy to like27:49a to teams that we have in different places then and now like a a world class27:55marathoner I've never seen a worldclass marathoner a mile 19 look like he's just honky Dory yeah28:02right and if he was he's about to lose so you push right to that edge of28:09what's possible and if that starts to get easy you push further now it doesn't necessar mean you push in exactly that28:16along that axis it could be in a totally different area but um as long as the28:23problems you're solving are greater than the problems you're28:29creating then you're fine when the problems you're creating are starts28:36to when the derivative of problems you're creating is greater than the28:41derivative of the problems you're solving then you have a real problem right and that's when you have to start28:46pulling back get back to above water and then go back into it but when I talk28:52about creating problems I think of it like think of it as like a math professor a math profess professor28:58without a really cool interesting problem to solve is a sad math professor and that's how we would think29:04about it right these we always pushing to the point where we're sweating yeah and it's29:10like not sure and there could be late nights there could be all nighters it could be that thing but because we were29:17doing the right thing because we had great people in the field who believed29:23then we could push all the way to that edge uh only they could be world class marathoners too only two entrepreneurs I29:31know have had the audacity to not build29:36their products in China everybody does that that's pretty easy but to actually operate a business in China yeah you and29:43Elon uh decided we're going to try to compete him with selling cars inside of29:49China pretty crazy uh and even crazier self- driving cars in China wow yeah29:55okay let's go let's go byd like you're up against some serious competition and it's not30:00exactly um a fair game maybe or there might be complications to that game um30:06we had a long conversation about China and I said to you wow we're burning a lot of money there what do you what's30:13the strategy here let me just hear it from you and uh you said we're we're going for gold yeah but I mean there's a30:19lot of fun there I mean look the thing about doing business in China is it30:24forces you to rethink everything everything like if you go into China30:30thinking you got it you're going to get your ass handed to you you have to start30:36first principles Bottoms Up um let's see where could I go with this um look we30:43tell me tell everybody the strategy hey we're going for gold but they're silver and and you how you looked at the world30:49in that regard yeah yeah so I'll get there is that we so a lot of times when30:54you go in ENT China they're basically somebody's going you got to have a partner if you just go and you do your31:00first exploration trip they' be like you got to get a partner they're like 50/50 blah blah blah and I'm like why nobody31:06could tell me why so then we just went on our own and started building something and we never saw on the ground31:14we never saw bias we were treated fairly on the31:20ground um but at some point what I'd say is the31:26China war went Global and what what I mean by that is the Chinese government I31:32think it was safe there was a there's some there's some I think it were called safe31:38like a it was like The Sovereign wealth of China cic there's like a few things like that they started investing31:44hundreds of millions and billions of dollars in all of our competitors globally to drain us of money so that it31:52was harder to compete in China they made apple and I'd love to have a32:00discussion with Tim at some point we had some interesting words for each other at this point but they made32:06Apple uh invest a billion dollars in Dee and apple doesn't invest anything in anybody no that's not their like what32:13was he protecting there there's something going on so whole really amazing story there holy32:19cow anyways uh the Chinese War went Global and so that's when we had to go32:25from going for the goal to making sure we got the silver and32:32that's when we started negotiating with de to basically say we had 20% of the of the overall entity of the32:40merged entity uh but in order to do that in China that's when we actually had to push our spend super hard because they32:47had to be scared so I think at the peak uh right be right as we were32:54negotiating the term sheet we pushed we were burning I think it32:59was $75 million a week it's a big number yeah that was33:07that yeah and but it but we knew we had the deal33:12but we only have the deal if they're scared right this is a poker so our market share was skyrocketing as we did33:20this they're pissed and tripping and then ail33:26who's negot the deal is like just chain smoking33:33yeah but that's how you get a deal done in China right uh and that turned out to33:38be there it is um that's that's your wartime CEO right there um that deal we33:47had invested millions in ch billions in China at that point and I think we I think we invested yeah we probably were33:53around a billion billion and a half and the DD St at the time when deal got done was we at 891 yeah something like that34:00so we turned a bill and a half into eight or nine I can't remember the exact math but it's something like that uh34:05let's talk about in like two years yeah let's talk about when you got atin UTravis reflects on getting ousted as CEO of Uber and his future34:12this was heartbreaking crushing brutal um you fought hard to34:19remain in the seat I got out there and did what I could on the Press front to34:24try to defend you and and try to keep you in the seat but we failed yeah uh34:30and it was brutal and it was particularly hard on you because you put your soul into this company yeah well look I think there's a34:37little bit more I mean uh you know like if an investor is34:43running a political Oppo campaign against you for six months sort of34:49generating a crisis every week for six months straight it's going to wear you down and then you know my34:58this one's hard your mom passed I35:05know I was there with you no no it's all good with you but that's that's when35:11they went in for the kill uh that I just couldn't hang yeah bottom line I just35:16couldn't hang [Applause]35:24yeah and yeah it was um it was dark it was dark yeah35:32so but look I a lot of people go hey are you pissed off or this thing and I35:37say um first I loved it every35:43minute I loved every minute but when you fall in love again you don't think about35:50the ex very much right Cloud kitchen the X you moved on35:58and you put all that in there in in the I I just want to say36:05like I am proud of everything you did and and watching you do it and getting36:10to be there and witness it I learned so much from you the community learned so36:15much from you and I think we all owe like the Playbook I I can tell you the36:21impact you had on the Next Generation because you know I never talk about Uber36:28I brought it up once or twice never talk I never talk about it I try to keep it lowkey but I brought it up once or twice36:33and it was good for my deal flow and I got to see I got to see I got I'm so honored to36:41be here I'm so honored to be here too uh but I got to see that famous Uber36:47investor and I mean this sincerely the number of entrepreneurs who came to me36:53who said I started this company because I watch Travis I watched what he did I37:00want to be Travis you inspired that generation along with Elon to say I want37:06to operate in the real world I want to build something that has an impact and I37:11am willing to fight and have that entrepreneurial Spirit which I'm going to be honest there's a large amount of37:19entrepreneurs who don't have the fight in they don't have the dog in them you got the dog in you you got the fight in37:26you you know and and that's so rare and that's why you're so successful it's because you're willing to fight the37:32fight yeah37:40um you know look we just saw the Olympics and I know I made that marathoner analogy before but like every37:46one of those gold medalists they got the dog in them there's no way no other way37:53um we're just playing a different sport and I think the you know some of the interesting parts about this sport is37:59that it's it's not just an individual thing it's a it's a massive team and38:05there's stakeholders in cities and citizens and and all that um it's just38:11fun you know like a lot of folks go look you did the Uber thing why are you doing it again I mean you catched in a lot of38:18chips you could be just chilling I'm like look Serena keeps getting on the court she's totally badass why is she38:24doing it right you know or take your favorite star of anything yeah LeBron's in his 4038:31what he's 40 now and he he's looks great out there so it's because they have a love of the game and it's not just38:37Showtime that day yeah it's everything behind the scenes it's working with38:42people especially in this sport like again individual stuff is a little different like you got to I like the38:47magic of working with magical people doing it as a crew is where all the good38:54stuff happens and they and you know they all keep coming back you know I've seen a lot of the the the folks who who came39:01for a second Tour of Duty with you that speaks volumes as we end here um Dar has done I got to know him yeah um try to39:08support the team over there for the Legacy um and he's he's he's done a decent job solid job profitable what's39:15that let's go they went from my 75 million a week to profitable I like it well I mean it is great the Legacy we39:22always knew it was easily to make it profitable people were saying oh it could never be profitable and you and I would talk and be like we were raise the39:28price of dollar profitable like it's not difficult just do you know look there's there's an art to that too it's all good39:35yeah um but yeah like like I think Uber's gotten to a great place the39:41profitability is there that's means it's going to be around now we they've got to figure out the autonomous thing that's I39:48think that's the next big challenge to uh to go after well let me just put it out39:53there he's he's going to do his tour and uh his stour is going to end would40:00you consider doing what Steve Job did and coming back and merging Cloud40:05kitchens with Uber would you consider it if if if the opportunity was there or can can you not40:13go you're saying there's a chance can you go home I mean if he this40:18would be the Return of the King this would be my dream if you came back I know it's not your dream but it's40:25mine could you if Cloud kitchens became part of uber it would be it would be a40:31trillion dollar company with you back in that seat would you take the seat again if if it was offered would you consider40:41it well I definitely know who my head of comms would be on that note Travis40:48Kalen my man I love you great jobEnglish (auto-generated)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzK9bx3CSPEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzK9bx3CSPE"
