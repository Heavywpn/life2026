00:00:08.860 [Music]  
00:00:14.599 hello and welcome back to learn Linux TV  
00:00:17.600 today in this video we're going to learn  
00:00:19.320 a command because that's what we do in  
00:00:21.439 this series The Linux crash course  
00:00:23.080 series what we do is we learn a very  
00:00:25.680 important Linux topic one video at a  
00:00:28.119 time and these videos could be watched  
00:00:29.679 in any order and today what we're going  
00:00:31.800 to do is cover the time command and the  
00:00:35.200 time command is really cool and very  
00:00:37.280 useful with it you can time scripts  
00:00:40.360 commands programs basically you could  
00:00:42.960 find out how long something takes and  
00:00:45.399 this is one of those commands that I  
00:00:47.039 can't believe I didn't cover until now I  
00:00:49.440 guess I couldn't find the time and I use  
00:00:52.000 this command personally frequently it's  
00:00:54.600 really useful one of the things that I  
00:00:56.559 use it for is to time my ansible  
00:00:58.719 provision runs some times I want to find  
00:01:00.800 out you know how long it takes for a  
00:01:02.199 system to be provisioned but sometimes I  
00:01:04.400 notice really strange things for example  
00:01:07.080 one time I noticed that my Provisions  
00:01:08.840 were taking literally twice as long to  
00:01:11.119 run and I knew that because of the time  
00:01:13.240 command which I use with that command  
00:01:14.759 every time once I noticed that I looked  
00:01:17.240 at my code and I realized that some of  
00:01:19.479 my roles are being run twice so because  
00:01:22.200 of the time command I was able to see  
00:01:24.720 the fact that the script was taking  
00:01:26.680 longer to run than normal that  
00:01:28.479 identified that there was a problem and  
00:01:30.280 I was able to solve it and speaking of  
00:01:32.520 anible I have a brand new anible course  
00:01:34.640 available over on uni it'll teach you  
00:01:36.320 everything you need to know to get  
00:01:37.880 started with anible in fact it's one of  
00:01:40.119 two brand new courses I have available  
00:01:42.000 over on  
00:01:42.880 udemy first if you're in the process of

00:02:03.840 source focused vendor neutral  
00:02:05.360 certification body so by earning  
00:02:07.520 certifications through LPI your  
00:02:09.440 credentials will be recognized around  
00:02:11.038 the world but even if you don't have any  
00:02:13.080 interest in getting certified this  
00:02:15.080 course is still a great fit for those of  
00:02:16.599 you that are getting started with Linux  
00:02:18.080 because it'll teach you all the basics  
00:02:20.519 also I recently released an anible  
00:02:22.360 course as well which will teach you  
00:02:23.959 everything you need to know to get up  
00:02:25.239 and running with anible anible is one of  
00:02:27.720 if not the most popular configuration in  
00:02:29.959 automation Platforms in the Linux  
00:02:31.920 ecosystem so it's definitely something  
00:02:33.840 that you need to learn anible is a  
00:02:35.920 powerful and easy tolearn platform that  
00:02:38.239 will enable you to automate even the  
00:02:39.959 most complicated Linux Administration  
00:02:41.840 tasks and just like with my Linux course  
00:02:44.440 each lesson will break down even the  
00:02:46.159 most complicated components and Concepts  
00:02:48.640 into easy to understand lessons and by  
00:02:50.879 the end of the course you'll learn  
00:02:52.280 everything that you need to know to use  
00:02:53.720 anible as part of your daily tool set  
00:02:56.480 and thank you guys so much for checking  
00:02:57.879 out my new courses and supporting Linux  
00:02:59.879 learning I really appreciate it now  
00:03:01.959 let's get started and learn the time  
00:03:07.040 command all right so here I am on my  
00:03:09.440 terminal and what I'm going to do is  
00:03:11.239 show you the time Command right now and  
00:03:13.599 you know what it's really easy to use  
00:03:16.159 what we could do is type the word time  
00:03:17.640 just like this and then after that any  
00:03:19.640 Linux command we want now the first  
00:03:22.200 example is a little boring to be honest  
00:03:24.519 but I'm going to show you a better  
00:03:25.799 example shortly but I'm going to use  
00:03:27.879 this example because it's simple and  
00:03:29.560 it's going to show you exactly what the  
00:03:31.319 time command does now in my home  
00:03:33.920 directory here I don't actually have any  
00:03:35.920 files which is why LS shows nothing but  
00:03:38.760 that's not the point what we're trying  
00:03:40.000 to find out is how long it took to run  
00:03:41.760 the command now the ls command is done  
00:03:44.560 in you know under a second so it's  
00:03:46.560 probably not a good command to use with  
00:03:48.799 this but it is going to show you what  
00:03:50.920 the time command does and here we see  
00:03:53.239 three lines of output we see how long it  
00:03:55.599 took to run the command in real mode  
00:03:57.799 user mode and system mode  
00:04:00.480 I'm going to go over what those modes  
00:04:02.040 mean in a little bit but what I want you  
00:04:03.920 to do is just focus on the first one for  
00:04:05.720 now real time now another example that  
00:04:09.000 might be a bit more useful is to use the  
00:04:11.799 time command when you're updating your  
00:04:13.560 system in the case of auntu which is  
00:04:15.760 what I'm logged into right now I can  
00:04:17.839 update the system by running pseudo apt  
00:04:19.680 and then disc  
00:04:21.519 upgrade just like that but what I'm  
00:04:23.639 going to do is use this command with a  
00:04:25.880 Time command now if you're not running  
00:04:27.919 auntu or Debian then this command won't  
00:04:29.919 work for you what you can do instead is  
00:04:31.759 just replace the pseudo apt disc upgrade  
00:04:34.000 part with whatever the command is to  
00:04:35.720 update the packages on your system so  
00:04:38.280 for example it could be sudu dnf update  
00:04:41.280 or something similar anyway what this  
00:04:43.400 command is going to do is install any  
00:04:45.039 updates that might be available and it's  
00:04:46.960 going to tell me exactly how long it  
00:04:48.479 took to do that  
00:04:51.039 unfortunately I don't really have any  
00:04:53.039 updates available at this time so again  
00:04:55.639 we have an example that's not going to  
00:04:57.199 be useful on my end but on your end if  
00:04:59.800 you wanted to time something like  
00:05:01.120 updating your system you could  
00:05:02.320 definitely do that with the time command  
00:05:04.520 now let's see an even better example  
00:05:06.280 what I'm going to do is use the time  
00:05:07.759 command with WG how long does it take to  
00:05:10.120 download something what I'll do right  
00:05:12.240 now is paste in the URL to an ISO image  
00:05:15.039 for a Linux  
00:05:16.759 distribution now obviously it doesn't  
00:05:18.880 matter which ISO you download you just  
00:05:20.680 need to download something for this  
00:05:22.319 example and nalin Os is one of the first  
00:05:25.000 things I thought of so I'll just go with  
00:05:27.039 that anyway let's go ahead and download  
00:05:29.479 it and see how long it  
00:05:34.360 takes and check it out I list my storage  
00:05:38.160 I have the alma Linux OS ISO image  
00:05:40.560 downloaded on my system and right above  
00:05:42.759 that we see the output from the time  
00:05:44.280 command when I ran it I was able to  
00:05:46.319 download the alma Linux ISO in 42  
00:05:49.120 seconds now what I'm going to do is just  
00:05:51.199 bring back the very simple example from  
00:05:53.199 the beginning because what I want to do  
00:05:55.319 right now is explain the output what  
00:05:57.840 does real mean user and system well  
00:06:01.039 let's go over that so first of all real  
00:06:03.520 refers to real time more often than not  
00:06:06.319 this is going to be the number that  
00:06:08.080 you're going to pay attention to so in  
00:06:10.520 this case when I ran the time command to  
00:06:12.319 download the iso image real time is the  
00:06:15.120 time that I took into account when I  
00:06:16.960 mentioned that it was around 42 seconds  
00:06:19.639 now we also have two other modes here we  
00:06:22.039 have user mode and system mode system  
00:06:24.800 mode is also referred to Kernel mode by  
00:06:26.840 the way and both of these are going to  
00:06:29.160 be a bit out of scope for this  
00:06:30.919 particular video user mode and system  
00:06:33.360 mode aren't necessarily specific to the  
00:06:35.639 time command but in case you're curious  
00:06:37.960 user mode refers to the time in which  
00:06:40.479 the process or script was being ran in  
00:06:43.240 user mode and then you could have  
00:06:45.599 aspects of the programmer script being  
00:06:47.400 run in system mode now system mode is  
00:06:49.840 the kernel side of things and user mode  
00:06:52.400 is the user side of things so if you as  
00:06:55.080 the user were to launch Firefox that's  
00:06:57.840 running in user mode but on the other  
00:07:00.400 hand if you were to configure modules or  
00:07:02.560 anything at the kernel level then that's  
00:07:04.520 going to be in kernel mode we're not  
00:07:06.599 going to go over that in this video any  
00:07:08.199 more than that I just wanted you to at  
00:07:09.840 least have the definition but the  
00:07:11.639 takeaway so far is that real time well  
00:07:14.240 that's what you're going to be  
00:07:15.120 interested in most of the time now if we  
00:07:17.879 check the man page for the time command  
00:07:20.479 you'll see that we have a few options  
00:07:22.319 here but when compared to other commands  
00:07:25.000 the options here aren't necessarily  
00:07:26.919 going to be as useful time is useful in  
00:07:29.280 and of itself because it well like I  
00:07:31.120 mentioned a few times now it times how  
00:07:33.560 long it takes to process something  
00:07:35.520 that's really good information to have  
00:07:37.960 but right here we have some other  
00:07:39.440 options that we could use if we wanted  
00:07:41.240 to so the- o option for example that  
00:07:44.080 lets us write output to a  
00:07:50.360 file you see the output right there  
00:07:53.240 missing line breaks but you get the  
00:07:54.919 basic idea now notice that I typed the  
00:07:57.560 fully qualified path to the time command  
00:07:59.840 when I use that option so this is the  
00:08:02.240 command that I ran right here now  
00:08:03.960 normally you don't have to type the full  
00:08:05.919 path to the command unless the command  
00:08:08.639 is not located in your path if you have  
00:08:10.879 no idea what I'm talking about I have a  
00:08:12.639 video that covers that so don't worry  
00:08:14.159 about it but the takeway here is that  
00:08:16.199 the behavior is actually going to be  
00:08:18.039 different if we do or do not include the  
00:08:20.440 full path to the  
00:08:21.840 command for example- O command not  
00:08:26.720 found however if we type the fully  
00:08:29.000 qualified  
00:08:30.479 path and then we run it you can see that  
00:08:34.159 it does indeed  
00:08:37.399 work and there we have the  
00:08:40.080 output now whether or not you have  
00:08:42.120 access to options depends on how you  
00:08:44.399 call the time command for example if I  
00:08:46.839 use time and then- O for output file I  
00:08:49.800 give it the output file and then I type  
00:08:51.560 the command then it's going to give me  
00:08:53.880 command not found however if I type the  
00:08:56.399 fully qualified path meaning I add SL  
00:08:59.040 users /bin to the front of the command  
00:09:01.160 because that's where it's located then  
00:09:02.880 I'm able to use the option now before we  
00:09:05.560 go any further though why is it that we  
00:09:07.760 have to type the full path to the time  
00:09:09.800 command just to be able to use options  
00:09:12.360 other commands don't require us to do  
00:09:14.200 this so why do we have to do that with  
00:09:15.800 the time command well the reason why  
00:09:18.360 this is the case is because there's two  
00:09:20.320 different kinds of time commands there's  
00:09:23.040 a built-in version meaning that is built  
00:09:25.120 into your shell the bass shell and then  
00:09:27.760 there's the external time command  
00:09:29.959 so if you just type the word time you're  
00:09:31.839 using the built-in shell version but if  
00:09:33.920 you type the full path to the time  
00:09:35.720 command you're using the external  
00:09:37.760 version that has more options now on  
00:09:40.200 some distributions this might be  
00:09:41.880 configured differently so your behavior  
00:09:44.200 might be different but for the most part  
00:09:46.600 all you have to do if you want to use  
00:09:48.399 options with the time command is type  
00:09:50.000 the full path to the command as we did  
00:09:52.200 in the previous  
00:09:53.519 example now one thing that I want to  
00:09:55.680 mention about this is that anytime you  
00:09:57.760 use the- o option and then give it a  
00:09:59.880 file name it's going to overwrite the  
00:10:03.360 file now what we could do is add- a for  
00:10:07.440 append mode and if this works what that  
00:10:09.680 should do is append to the end of the  
00:10:11.959 file rather than overwriting it every  
00:10:14.600 time so I'll just go ahead and do this a  
00:10:17.160 few  
00:10:20.839 times and here you can see that every  
00:10:22.800 time I ran that command it appended  
00:10:24.560 information to the end of the file  
00:10:26.240 rather than overwriting it so if you  
00:10:28.240 want to access a pen mode just add the-  
00:10:30.760 a option but for the most part time is  
00:10:34.120 very easy to use all it is is just time  
00:10:37.920 and then you type a command or perhaps a  
00:10:40.519 path to a binary a script maybe even WG  
00:10:44.200 for downloading something anytime you  
00:10:46.200 want to time something the time command  
00:10:48.120 is a great way to do  
00:10:52.560 it and there you go like I mentioned  
00:10:55.399 earlier the time command is very very  
00:10:57.760 simple and very easy to use it's  
00:11:00.279 definitely something that I recommend  
00:11:01.760 that you remember and thankfully it's  
00:11:03.320 not really hard to remember all you have  
00:11:04.720 to do is type time and then a command  
00:11:07.279 and that's it so what did you guys think  
00:11:09.639 of this shorter episode in the Linux  
00:11:11.720 crash course series I definitely wanted  
00:11:13.240 to make sure that I covered this command  
00:11:15.399 but sometimes there's just not as much  
00:11:17.079 to cover as other commands sure there's  
00:11:19.040 a few other options on there but for the  
00:11:21.120 most part usage of the time command is  
00:11:23.360 just time and then command and that's  
00:11:25.160 all there is to it anyway I had a ton of  
00:11:27.360 fun producing this episode for you guys
