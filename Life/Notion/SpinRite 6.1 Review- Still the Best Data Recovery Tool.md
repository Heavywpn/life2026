Transcipt: 0:14hello and welcome back to learn Linux TV0:17in this video what I'm going to do is0:19talk to you guys about spin right now0:21spin right might be an unlikely choice0:23for a Linux related YouTube channel and0:25it kind of is but the thing is this0:27application does have a use case for0:30Linux0:31users but what exactly is spin right0:34well spin right is a Dos utility and its0:36main purpose is to prevent and recover0:39from data loss and hard drive failure0:41respectively spin R is run from a USB0:43flash drive or CD so it bypasses the0:46underlying operating system of your0:47computer or server once booted it'll0:49give you a choice of a few different0:50types of scans or levels and once you0:53run a desired test against a drive you0:55simply wait for the results I'll talk0:57more about spin right's capabilities as0:59well as its pros and cons later in the1:01video now before we get started though IWhy make this video?1:03just wanted to mention that this video1:05is not sponsored by GRC the creator of1:08spin rate now actually I don't even know1:10if GRC is even aware that this channel1:12even exists I've been using this app for1:14quite some time and I decided a long1:16time ago to do a video about it the1:19thing is back then it was mentioned that1:216.1 was being worked on so I decided1:24that it just didn't make sense to create1:26a video about something that was going1:29to just be updated dated so I decided to1:30wait and that wait turned into well1:33quite a long time but now 6.1 is finally1:36out and I decided to give it a review in1:38this video but perhaps the bigger1:40question though is why is the Linux guy1:42reviewing a Dos application well here's1:45the thing there's a great deal of Linux1:47administrators and homeb fans within my1:49audience when it comes to my home lab1:51audience one of the many amazing things1:53that they do is keep servers out of1:54landfills and that's awesome people that1:57are into self-hosting regularly1:59repurpose out ofate corporate equipment2:01all the time since servers that may no2:02longer be good enough for the Enterprise2:04are still plenty good enough for all of2:05you mad scientists out there now keep in2:08mind if you repurpose old servers then2:10you're also repurposing old hard drives2:12and that brings me to the first benefit2:14that spin right has for Linux users if2:16you purchase a secondhand server running2:18spin right on it before you put it into2:20production can only benefit you as spin2:23right can trigger error correction on2:24hard disk better than the OEM tools can2:27this way if there's any problematic2:28sectors on any of your hard discs it's a2:30good idea to have them detected before2:32you put a server into production not2:35after now for those of you that have had2:37servers in production for a long time2:39it's a good idea to run spin rate on2:41those every now and then maybe every2:43year or so that's just a personal2:44opinion on my side but it shouldn't hurt2:47you might even find that your Hardware2:48performs better after doing so I mean2:51your family can be without the Plex2:53server for a little bit can't they maybe2:54it's a good excuse to go2:56outside another use case for spin right2:59is for data recover recovery in fact3:01spinrite is one of three bootable tools3:03that I feel every administrator needs3:05the other two being mem test 86 and a3:07live image of your favorite Linux drro3:09now if you've potentially lost files3:11perhaps your devices and booting then3:12running spin right against the drive3:14might actually help you get your files3:16back it's possible that spin right's3:18airor correction might even repair the3:19drive but I figure if you have to go3:21through a bunch of work to get your3:23files back you may not want to trust3:25that drive any longer but I3:27digress data recovery features make spin3:30very useful in the Enterprise but home3:31users can definitely benefit from that3:33too now the way that spin right works ifWhat exactly does SpinRite do?3:35I put it very simply is that it gives3:37your hard disk a bit of a workout it3:39writes complex data to sectors in order3:40to test their read and write capability3:43and if there's a problem here the sector3:44will be marked bad and another will3:46replace it now to be fair so far that's3:49nothing unique even the manufacturer's3:51tools can do what I just described and3:53you can also do the same thing with open3:55source tools and there's probably a3:56dozen or so other ways I could think of3:59but the value of spin right is that it4:01tries really really really hard and4:03focuses very intensely on your disc more4:06intensely than even the manufacturers4:08tools generally do basically spinrite4:10has just one job and it does it very4:12well sorry to interrupt my own video butCheck out the updated merch shop! merch.learnlinux.tv4:15I just wanted to let you

a4:45mouse pad that doubles as a t-mo cheat4:46sheet how cool is that so check out the4:49shop at merch.ly TV or you can check out4:52the merch shelf right here on YouTube4:54you could get yourself something really4:56cool and support Linux learning at the4:58same time so it's a win-win5:00anyway thank you guys so much for your5:01support I really appreciate it now let's5:03get back to the5:05video more specifically there's threeSpinRite's "Levels"5:07different operating modes or levels of5:09spin right and the one that you'll end5:11up using depends on your needs level one5:13is a more basic read test that's not5:15super intensive but is good enough to5:17make sure all the data on your hard5:18drive is readable level two on the other5:20hand kicks things up a notch and5:22attempts recovery of any data found on5:24your drive that might not be readable5:26that's why if you want to perform data5:27recovery you might want to consider5:28starting here5:30level three is the most intensive5:31rewriting all data on your drive this5:34will help ensure that all data resides5:35only in sections of your hard disk known5:37to be within normal operation however5:40this test might take a lot longer to5:41complete if you want to check out spinSpinRite purchase and setup experience5:43right for yourself it'll set you back5:45$89 so this isn't free software but I5:48figure that the price tag is reasonable5:50for how useful it is and who knows maybe5:52someone within my audience will find it5:54useful once purchased you'll receive a5:56ridiculously tiny executable that's so5:58small you'll probably think think that5:59your download was disconnected but no6:02it's really that small this executable6:05will only run on Windows unfortunately6:06but you only have to run it once since6:08what it does is write spin rate to a6:10bootable Drive such as a flash drive of6:13course you can create bootable spin rate6:14media on Mac OS and Linux as well6:17there's an image file that's included6:18that you can use with your platform's6:20respective dis utility to create the6:21media now it's recommended that you use6:23the windows tool though but if you're6:25oppositional you could always write the6:26image6:27manually now before you go and thisThe downsides of SpinRite6:30though there are a few important6:31downsides to consider first in order to6:34use spin rate you'll need to modify the6:35settings of your host device in6:37particular what you'll need to do is6:39boot into Bios mode and also disable6:41secure boot now the author spin right is6:44quick to caution against disabling6:45secure boot unless you read the6:47documentation first so that way you can6:49understand if there's any other6:50ramifications of doing so generally6:53speaking you'll switch your computer to6:54Bios mode and disable secure boot run6:57spin right and then go back to your6:58computer settings and set everything7:00back to the way it was before continuing7:01to use it it sounds like a pain and well7:04it is but thankfully Steve mentions that7:07future versions will address this my7:09advice is rather than changing your7:10computer settings you could repurpose an7:12old desktop as a spin right machine7:15which you could do is power it on7:16disable secure boot switch it to Bios7:18mode and then leave it powered off then7:21what you could do anytime you want to7:23use spin right is you could take the7:24drive out of the device and just run it7:26from the spin right computer but that7:29might be overkill for some of you but7:30who knows thankfully though the biggest7:33downside has been addressed in version7:346.1 for the longest time spin right has7:37been very slow painfully slow and this7:40is another reason why I was waiting for7:41the latest version to come out before7:43reviewing it it was so slow that it7:45wasn't uncommon for me to leave a7:46machine running over the weekend and7:48most of the time a scan would be7:49finished by the time it came back7:51however 6.1 has a Rewritten engine that7:53is much faster than before and I could7:55definitely notice the difference in fact7:58this is the main selling point of the7:59new version I received 6.1 as a free8:02upgrade from having purchased the8:03original version a long time back and I8:05think this speed boost more than makes8:06it worth the wait another potential8:09downside when it comes to spin right is8:11that purchasing it can be somewhat like8:13an insurance policy that you may or may8:14not find useful I mean think of it this8:16way you don't know ahead of time if8:18you're going to suffer a data recovery8:20issue and have to recover data you can't8:22really know that ahead of time so if you8:24purchase spin rate you're purchasing8:26something for a problem that you hope8:28you never have but if you do have that8:30problem then well you hope that it's8:32useful and whether or not it's useful8:34really depends on the problem that8:36you're trying to solve spin right is not8:38something that's going to fix every hard8:40drive issue if your computer itself8:42can't even detect the hard drive then8:44spin right won't be able to do that8:45either so we need to have you know8:47reasonable expectations here but as long8:50as we do that then spin right is really8:52useful that said I think spin right is8:55worth the purchase sure it's one of8:57those things that you hope you'll never8:58need and if you do need it you hope to9:00be glad that you did get it but aside9:03from that it's also good for9:04preventative maintenance as well and it9:06might even give you a performance boost9:09now let me know what you think of spin9:10right or any other tool that I mention9:12on this channel in the description down9:14below I can't wait to read what you guys9:16have to say in the meantime though9:17definitely subscribe to learn Linux TV9:19for the latest in Linux if you haven't9:21already done that and I'll see you in9:22the next videoEnglish (auto-generated)
