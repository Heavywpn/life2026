A simple guide to this Habit Journal template.

- **How to navigate this template**
    - At the top of each page you’ll see a menu toggle marked ◉: click it to see ‘@ mentions’ of each dashboard.
    - You’ll see the menu is in a ‘/synced block’ meaning it is duplicated and synced as a menu on each page it is pasted. I’ve put it on all the dahsboard views. give it a go.

    - You can add other ‘@mention’ page links to this if you want and build the system out. But make sure you put the originals at the bottom of the main home page with the other dashboards and system menus
- **How to setup a New Year**
    
    1. First Set the Year up
        1. Open the Years Summary Dashboard and select ‘==NEW==’ to add a new Year. Name the year.
        2. Go to the dashboard and filter your Habit Tracker Database on the Homescreen by the New Year to hide the previous one.
        3. Note you can still view these in the Year Page via the Year Summary Dashboard.
    2. Next, setup your Days Database to link to the new year you created.
        1. Select the arrow next to ‘==NEW==’ button on the Days Database

- **How to a**==**dd a new day or automating it to repeat**==
    
    ==You can either add a new day by==
    
    - ==selecting new on the Days database==
    - ==using ‘Start New Day’ button on the home screen==
    - ==or by setting the default ‘Today’ to repeat ‘every day*==
    
      
    
    To Automate The Day
    
    1. Select the arrow next to ‘==NEW==’ button on the Days Database
    2. Select ‘…’ next to the Default page template called ‘@Today’ and then select ‘Repeat’
    3. Set the template to repeat daily, leaving it on the 12 mindnight time
    4. Check the timezone is the same as your own and then exit/save the template
    
    _*Note that the repeat option means that the new day will not automatically have it’s date set, but it will have ‘@Today’ written in the title - so you can still identify which day it was._
    
    Done!
    
      
    
      
    
- **How to Make the Most of the ‘Today’ Page in ‘Days’**
    1. The Days database is where you link habit from the Habit database in order to log them… but you can also edit other properties within it to add to you log.
    2. Don’t forget: you can put anything within the Today page: it can be your journal and daily reflection space if you like! Why not use ‘/button’ to create options for journaling prompts you can generate in the page? Just edit the ‘Days’ default template page and add what you need there!
    3. Click the High / Low / Medium Productivity buttons to decide on your productivity rating for the day - you’ll see it updates the ‘@Today’
    4. You can also do mood logging: just click on today’s log and type or select option in the mood column
- **How to Track Habits**
    
    Do the Habit, check it off using the buttons… OK I know it’s not that simple.
    
    Apple users: try adding a Notion widget to an iOS device that links to the tracker for quick access to the buttons.

- **How to Journal In This Template**
    - Quick Start Overview
        - 🖊️ Click on the write button to add a new entry, and select the journaling prompt you want to try.
        - 💭 Try the Daily Reflection Template first: it's my 5-minute daily journaling guide spilt into morning and evening.
        - 🖋️ Title entries before saving, or copy and paste the heading from the page, change the cover if you want to.
        - 🗓️ Use the 'Build A Chain' View to track your progress.
        - 🗓️ Use the Week View To See Your Entries for the week
        - 💡 Use the Connections View to reference entries in your wider projects _(create a linked database to your projects)_
        - 🖊️ There is an **AI Summary & AI Subject Tag** property in the system. If you pay for Noiton AI, you can use this to generate a custom summary or what you write. Clicking into the edit property’ view will show the simple instructions I have added to focus the summary - you can experiment to get what you need from it.
        - If you own an iPad you can try using scribble to write by hand, or even use dictation on your phone or tablet!
        - 🗓️ Adding a date to the ‘Manually Set Date’ column allows you to set a date different to ‘Now’.
        - 🗓️ If you want to make the journal entirely manual for dating entries: change the calendar views to be views of the ‘Manually Set Date’ Column and filter all views by that column. You might simply rename this column to ‘Date’ in this instance
    - Edit The Prompted Template Pages
        - If you would like to edit any of the template page options, just click the blue arrow next to the ‘NEW’ button on any page, click on the three dots ‘…’ menu next to the template you want to edit and select ‘edit’.
        - You will be able to edit the content of the template page as you wish, and it
    - Create More Template Pages & Find More Prompts
        
        - You can add your own prompted template pages to the system by creating new template pages. I recommend duplicating an existing template using the same ‘…’ menu as above, and then editing following the same steps.
        - You can find more prompt ideas and inspiration for journaling at these sources

        Watch my older video for the basics of how this system works here:
        
- **How to Find The System Database + Clearing Demo Data**
    
    You’ll find all the master System Databases used in this template in the ‘System Databases’ page at the bottom of the main dashboard. DO NOT DELETE THIS.
    
    - you can however delete entries in those views if you want to clear any examples of old entries.
    - All other views within the template are _linked_ ‘/table’ or ‘/calendar’ views (etc) of those databases. In Notion, deleting the linked views will not delete the data in the master databases - since they are really filtered windows to those master. So have a play!
- **How to find the Original Dashboard Pages**
    
    The Dashboard pages are listed under the System Database Page at the bottom of the home screen. Don’t delete these - they serve the menu options in the synced menu at the top of the page.
    
- **Video Guides & Other Useful Thing Related To This Template**
    
    This is a list of videos relevant to each section of the system. There are loads of videos on the Better Creating YouTube channel that will demo how to use this system, and below that; tutorials for building more to add to it!
