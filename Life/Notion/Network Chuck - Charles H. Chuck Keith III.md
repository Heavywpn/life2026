Like seriously,  <br>00:00:05.460 while my team and I were gone for threeweeks working on a top secret project  <br>00:00:08.670 for a pretty big YouTuber .  <br>00:00:10.710 I was just telling everyone how Nick waslazy and didn't finish his edit before  <br>00:00:14.460 the trip. Oh yeah, I only stayed up.  <br>00:00:17.010 Till one. I can't tell you about it.Don't even ask me. I'll tell you later.  <br>00:00:19.590 We needed a secure wicked fasts wayto access all of our stuff back home.  <br>00:00:23.550 Things like my big fat NASS remote desktopinto our editing machines and even my  <br>00:00:27.450 home lab to watch some flex. That'skind of what VPN is for, right? I mean,  <br>00:00:30.900 sure I could have set it up,but I didn't have the time.  <br>00:00:32.910 And the solution I found took about fiveminutes. And this one might shock you.  <br>00:00:36.270 VPN is not secure enough.  <br>00:00:37.600 Like when I give my twoknucklehead editors VP in access,  <br>00:00:40.800 they get access to everything serversthey shouldn't touch and they have a nasty  <br>00:00:44.160 habit of downloading free ramp.  <br>00:00:45.600 And if they already have malware and theycan blast it out to my entire network,  <br>00:00:49.050 what I need is a solution that givesthem access to only stuff they need.  <br>00:00:52.530 Nothing else.  <br>00:00:53.400 This is a little technique calledzero trust because I zero trust them.  <br>00:00:57.300 And listen, it's not just security aftersome research, VPN is kind of the uh,  <br>00:01:02.730 kind of the old way of doingthings and old as lane. I mean,  <br>00:01:07.565 have you seen the new stuff? It's [crazy.So](http://crazy.so/) what I found, it's kind of amazing.  <br>00:01:12.180 It's called Twin Gate. It's a zerotrust, remote access solution, buzzwords,  <br>00:01:15.630 blah blah blah. It basically means magicand it checks all my boxes. Watch this.  <br>00:01:20.010 In about five minutes,I deploy the Twin Gate,  <br>00:01:22.050 Docker container to my studionetwork, my home lab network,  <br>00:01:25.230 and even some private networksin the cloud. And just like that,  <br>00:01:28.200 I can connect from anywhere no matterwhere I go, no firewall config,  <br>00:01:31.950 no port forwarding and just works.  <br>00:01:33.660 And I don't care if you have CGNat or some weird I S P issues.  <br>00:01:37.830 It just does its thing kindof scary, easy actually.  <br>00:01:40.650 I have granular control on whateach person on my team can access.  <br>00:01:44.370 I can even say, you could only accessthis machine on this port and that's it.  <br>00:01:48.060 I can even control what they'reallowed to access stuff with.  <br>00:01:50.646 Like I could say they can use iPhonesbut no Android and that just makes sense.  <br>00:01:54.570 And if they're using Windows, I canrequire antivirus firewall settings.  <br>00:01:58.230 And if they don't have 'em, theycan't connect. And the crazy part,  <br>00:02:01.110 this is free, free for up to fiveusers and that covers my business.  <br>00:02:05.010 So let's get this set upin your network right now.  <br>00:02:07.560 I'll walk you throughevery step. It'll be quick,  <br>00:02:09.580 no longer than it taste tobrew a cup of coffee, trust me.  <br>00:02:12.150 And speaking of coffee,go ahead and do that.  <br>00:02:13.800 Grab you some because everythingin it requires coffee.  <br>00:02:19.440 Also,  <br>00:02:19.860 shout out to Twin Gate for helping mesolve my remote access problems and for  <br>00:02:23.100 sponsoring this video.  <br>00:02:24.210 Now I'm pretty picky about sponsorsand Twin Gate makes the cut. I love it.  <br>00:02:27.660 It's something I actuallyuse for everything and Iknow this will provide a ton  <br>00:02:31.290 of value to you. So let's get intoit. Actually, you know, real quick,  <br>00:02:34.350 have you hacked theYouTube algorithm today?  <br>00:02:36.390 Let's make sure you do hit thatlike button notification bell.  <br>00:02:38.220 Come and subscribe to everything. Yes,you gotta hack YouTube today ethically,  <br>00:02:43.260 of course. Now here's the setup.We have our network for me,  <br>00:02:45.990 it's my studio for you, it mightbe your home lab or your business.  <br>00:02:48.720 The goal here is to get my knuckleheadeditors access to what they need inside  <br>00:02:53.040 my network. So Income's TwinGate. Twin Gate has four parts.  <br>00:02:56.640 And don't let that scare you. You'llhave to worry about two of 'em.  <br>00:02:58.800 I'm telling you, this is not complex, atleast the setup. We've got our client,  <br>00:03:02.200 our connector, ourcontroller, and our relay.  <br>00:03:05.350 Right now we're gonna focus onthe connector and the controller.  <br>00:03:08.020 The controller is managed byTwin Gate. It's in their cloud,  <br>00:03:10.630 and it's what we'll use to sign up fora free account and configure all our  <br>00:03:13.395 stuff and who has accessto what the connector is,  <br>00:03:15.820 the docker container you'regonna put inside of your network,  <br>00:03:18.700 behind your firewall.  <br>00:03:19.810 And all you have to know about theconnector is that it connects stuff.  <br>00:03:22.750 That's all you have to know.  <br>00:03:23.560 I think that's the only twosteps we have to worry about.  <br>00:03:25.660 Set up an account on TwinGate, which is the controller,  <br>00:03:28.270 and then deploy the connectorinside our network. Done.  <br>00:03:32.140 Now that does beg the question, whatdo we need for this? Only two things.  <br>00:03:35.800 First, you'll need something to put thatDocker container on some type of Lennox  <br>00:03:40.510 server. This could be your nas, anold laptop, even a raspberry pie,  <br>00:03:44.110 which is what I'm goingto demo on right now.  <br>00:03:46.000 And the second thing you shouldalready have in your hand right now,  <br>00:03:48.430 a cup of coffee. Like I said, everythingin it requires coffee. Say it with me,  <br>00:03:52.240 I'm not gonna do it again, butseriously, get some coffee.  <br>00:03:54.430 First step is the controller. So headout to twin [gates.com](http://gates.com/). That's simple.  <br>00:03:58.330 That's it. It's time toditch your vpn. Dang right.  <br>00:04:00.550 And right here in the middle, we'regonna click on try Twin Gate for free.  <br>00:04:03.520 Try twin gate, try twin gates. Say that10 times fast. That's ridiculously hard.  <br>00:04:07.000 Click it here. Pick your poison.What do you wanna log in with?  <br>00:04:09.940 I'm gonna log in with GitHub,click on that authorize twin gate.  <br>00:04:13.060 And here we have some details.Now if you're like, okay,  <br>00:04:15.760 I'm setting this up for my home lab, Idon't have a company name, don't worry,  <br>00:04:18.910 they're gonna give you a business trialfor 14 days, no credit card, whatever.  <br>00:04:22.000 You're gonna have that starter plan forfree forever. So make up a company name.  <br>00:04:25.600 I'm gonna name my own hack, well technumber of employees under a hundred.  <br>00:04:29.350 Let's finish it up. Skip allthis, blah, blah, blah. No,  <br>00:04:32.050 I don't need technical support. I'm good.I can run C commands, I promise I can.  <br>00:04:35.260 And then choose your url. I'llleave it at Hack Wall Tech.  <br>00:04:37.750 Good to go create that network. So atthis point you have a twin Gate account,  <br>00:04:41.380 you have a controller. Now all wehave to do is configure a few things.  <br>00:04:44.590 There are two thingswe're gonna start with,  <br>00:04:46.000 and it's actually tellingyou right here at step one,  <br>00:04:48.070 the first thing we'll setup is your remote network,  <br>00:04:49.490 which will be your home lab,studio, business, whatever.  <br>00:04:52.810 And once we defined it here,  <br>00:04:53.980 we can actually deploy ourconnector to connect everything up.  <br>00:04:57.790 The second thing will configureresources. By default,  <br>00:05:00.370 you can't access anything.  <br>00:05:01.480 So you have to specifically explicitlydefine what you are allowed to access in  <br>00:05:06.370 your network. I love that. Zerotrust. All right, let's go.  <br>00:05:09.340 Let's knock out the network first.  <br>00:05:10.990 You'll notice right down here we have adda remote network. Let's click on that.  <br>00:05:15.100 Choose your location. Noticeyou have some options.  <br>00:05:17.560 What I care about right now ison-premise, and I'll name it Hack well  <br>00:05:23.980 hq, add Remote Network. Man, that wasso hard, right? , that was easy.  <br>00:05:27.240 And we're almost done actually. Now todeploy our connector inside the network.  <br>00:05:31.240 Notice they have two connectorsover here, but they're not deployed.  <br>00:05:34.810 And notice they do want you to deploytwo, you can deploy one, that's fine.  <br>00:05:38.230 But if you want redundancy and highavailability, you can deploy two.  <br>00:05:41.290 But we'll start with one, butwhich one to pick? Impetuous,  <br>00:05:44.290 jagar or Optimal Vulture. Ican pronounce this better.  <br>00:05:48.130 I'm gonna go with that one.  <br>00:05:48.910 So we'll click on deploy connector andwe'll choose how we're going to deploy  <br>00:05:51.910 this. Now, I talked about this Docker,  <br>00:05:54.070 docker's so easy we're gonna go withthat, but you do have options. Step,  <br>00:05:57.350 we're gonna generate ourtokens. What are those?  <br>00:05:59.930 We'll cover more about thathere in a bit. In fact,  <br>00:06:01.880 I'm gonna go kind of nerdy on you andexplain the magic of how this works.  <br>00:06:05.540 But let's set this up. First. We'llgo ahead and generate our tokens.  <br>00:06:08.120 Click on generate tokens, and it willask you to authenticate yourself again,  <br>00:06:11.480 which is great security.  <br>00:06:13.040 And you'll notice you do have youraccess and refresh tokens generated.  <br>00:06:16.280 And then we'll scrollon down to step four.  <br>00:06:18.710 And all we have to do here is copy andpaste this Docker run command and we're  <br>00:06:22.585 good to go. So I'll pause here for asecond. Let's get logged into the device.  <br>00:06:25.610 We're going to install our twin gateconnector on. For me it's a raspberry pie.  <br>00:06:29.810 So here in Windows I'm gonna launch myterminal and I'll ssh into my raspberry  <br>00:06:33.320 pie. And before we copyand paste our command,  <br>00:06:35.660 let's just make sure we have Dockerinstalled, and that's super easy. First,  <br>00:06:38.630 we'll update our repositories,pseudo p t update,  <br>00:06:41.870 and then we'll install Dockerpseudo apt install [docker.io](http://docker.io/)  <br>00:06:46.760 dash y. Mine is already installed,but it should go pretty quick for you.  <br>00:06:49.910 And now literally all wehave to do is copy and paste.  <br>00:06:53.330 So we'll get back to our browserhere, click the copy command,  <br>00:06:56.000 go back to our terminal and paste. Andyou may have to run this as pseudo.  <br>00:06:59.840 I wanna do a control A,  <br>00:07:01.250 run it as pseudo at the beginning andthen hit enter and let the party start.  <br>00:07:05.600 Who, ah, I love seeing this quickcoffee break while the show's happening.  <br>00:07:08.870 Just enjoy the show.  <br>00:07:12.770 And that was it. So real quickwhile we're here on the terminal,  <br>00:07:16.220 before we leave, let's type inpseudo docker PS to make sure it's,  <br>00:07:20.780 it's in there running. Andthere it is, it's running.  <br>00:07:22.670 And now if we get back to ourtwinge controller, aka [twinge.com](http://twinge.com/),  <br>00:07:27.290 there it is. Our connection status,the optimal vulture is connected.  <br>00:07:31.400 Now let's add some resources. Let'sget back to our network up here.  <br>00:07:34.790 Click on that. And we don'treally need this right now.  <br>00:07:36.710 So let's just click on dismiss.  <br>00:07:38.030 And right here you'll seean add resource button.  <br>00:07:40.250 Let's click on that Add resource.  <br>00:07:41.840 The first thing we'll dois choose a remote network.  <br>00:07:43.760 I'm gonna pick Hack well hq. And yes,  <br>00:07:45.830 that does mean you can havemore than one remote network.  <br>00:07:47.740 So add your parents' house at grandma'shouse, your friend's house, whatever.  <br>00:07:51.080 You can do that. Then we'll specify ourhost. Now we can use DNS or IP address.  <br>00:07:55.160 And this DNS thing, by the way, is crazy.  <br>00:07:57.740 We'll cover that here in a bit for now.  <br>00:07:59.270 We'll focus on IP addressto keep things simple.  <br>00:08:01.190 So choose cider label what you'resetting up. I'm gonna access my nas.  <br>00:08:04.220 First big fat nas. Then the IP address.  <br>00:08:08.780 Keep in mind, this will beyour private IP address aside,  <br>00:08:11.300 your home network or yourbusiness network, whatever it is.  <br>00:08:14.120 Then also notice we have an alias option.  <br>00:08:16.430 We'll cover that when we talk about dns.But again, this whole thing is insane.  <br>00:08:20.120 It's magic. I can't wait to tellyou that though. But let, let's,  <br>00:08:22.310 let's keep moving forward. Nextwe have protocol restrictions.  <br>00:08:24.740 And what I wanna do is have myeditors only access my NASS on Port  <br>00:08:29.240 5,000, which is the gooey. So Iclick on protocol restrictions.  <br>00:08:33.169 Right now everything'sallowed, may not want that.  <br>00:08:35.539 So we'll say TCP restrict and we'llspecify the ports. I'll say 5,000.  <br>00:08:40.220 And then I'll block UDP andblock I C M P. So at this point,  <br>00:08:44.930 only port 5,000 TCP is allowed.That's all we care about right now.  <br>00:08:49.100 I'm gonna click on ad resource.And then as soon as you do that,  <br>00:08:51.475 you can choose who has access to thisresource for now we have one group.  <br>00:08:55.050 That's everyone. I'll go ahead and addthat. We can change that at any time.  <br>00:08:58.950 And I'll click on add one [group.So](http://group.so/) right now we have a resource.  <br>00:09:01.800 If I hover over this guy right here,  <br>00:09:03.540 it'll tell me exactly what'sallowed TCP 5,000. That's it.  <br>00:09:06.660 So what do you say we tested out? Whichby the way, you just set up Twin Gate,  <br>00:09:09.990 like that was it. That's all it took.Now we have to worry about is the client.  <br>00:09:13.290 The third piece,  <br>00:09:14.670 which is just installing an appand logging in super hard .  <br>00:09:18.480 Let's try that right now. Allright, I got my laptop here.  <br>00:09:20.670 I wanna download the Twin Gate clientby heading out to twin [gate.com/download](http://gate.com/download)  <br>00:09:25.050 cuz I'm using Windows. I'llclick on download for Windows.  <br>00:09:27.450 They have an app for everything. Mac, goWest, iPhone, Android, whatever. It's,  <br>00:09:30.630 I'll open the file and install thesucker and click on finish. Ugh.  <br>00:09:34.440 And a restart. I hate restartingthis stuff. One moment. Now,  <br>00:09:37.020 before I configure TwinGate, like any good magician,  <br>00:09:39.480 let me show you that I can'taccess my stuff. First.  <br>00:09:42.150 I want to make sure I'm connectedto my 5G connection on my phone.  <br>00:09:45.395 Now let's try and access my NASSfour, 5,000. It's not looking good.  <br>00:09:49.080 Can't reach the page. Nowlet's sign into twinge.  <br>00:09:51.270 I'll connect to Hack Well Tech, that'swhen I named it, right? Yeah, I think so.  <br>00:09:55.140 I'll join that network, sign in withmy GitHub and we should be good to go.  <br>00:09:59.580 I'm gonna close my browser windowreal quick. It already happened.  <br>00:10:02.610 Look at that 5,000. I'm going over it,man. Look at my tray right now. Yes,  <br>00:10:07.350 I can see I'm connected.Oh, that's so stinking cool.  <br>00:10:09.990 I love this but I shouldn't be ableto ping anything. Let's see. Yeah,  <br>00:10:13.800 nothing campaign it. We disabledIC m p, let's try S ssh. Nothing.  <br>00:10:17.880 Let me nail it real quick.Actually, I wanna test this.  <br>00:10:19.890 Now we're rolling then I'm gonnajust edit it real quick and add  <br>00:10:24.690 port 22. Let's see what happens.Confirm changes. Let's try it now. Oh,  <br>00:10:29.280 took a minute, but I'm in justlike that. How cool is that?  <br>00:10:32.490 Now at this point you've configuredTwin Gate, like it works, it's amazing.  <br>00:10:35.670 But there's more we can do. There'sDNS based routing, device security,  <br>00:10:39.270 and we're gonna walk through all thathere in a moment. But if you're like me,  <br>00:10:42.090 kind of a nerd, you can't just walkaway from this video thinking, okay,  <br>00:10:45.060 I've got the fastest, most secureway to connect to my stuff.  <br>00:10:47.670 But you have to know how it works,right? Like how is this thing working?  <br>00:10:50.760 Let's talk about that Nowlet's get a bit nerdy.  <br>00:10:52.980 Let's pop the hood on thisthing and see what's going on.  <br>00:10:54.960 What's the magic that's makingall this tick? And it's,  <br>00:10:57.120 it's actually really cool. Ican't wait to show you now.  <br>00:10:58.980 I'll start with this Twin gate. It's,it's not a p n, it's not .  <br>00:11:02.460 Let me explain Now, the goal forTwin Gate is this right here,  <br>00:11:05.160 a secure end-to-end TLS tunnel. It'speer-to-peer between the client,  <br>00:11:09.330 which is you or your family oryour employees, friends, whatever,  <br>00:11:12.390 and the connector inside yournetwork. But how does this happen?  <br>00:11:15.450 Especially with networksthat don't play nice.  <br>00:11:17.250 They have like CG Nat Dynamic IP addressesand all the craziness our ISPs put us  <br>00:11:21.425 through. Because trust me, if youhave those networks, this thing just,  <br>00:11:24.120 it just works. But how,  <br>00:11:25.950 let's start with the connectorcuz he does most of the work.  <br>00:11:28.110 The connector is this guy.  <br>00:11:29.040 Let's talk about how theconnector was born real quick.  <br>00:11:30.870 So you may recall in our controller here,  <br>00:11:32.700 we deploy the connector inside thecontroller, the optimal vulture.  <br>00:11:35.790 When we did that, we had to generatea couple of tokens like, like this.  <br>00:11:39.030 If I try to deploy anotherconnector, I'll say generate tokens,  <br>00:11:41.640 have to authenticateagain. And there they are.  <br>00:11:43.470 I point this out because this isa key part of Twin Gate security.  <br>00:11:47.010 They use more tokens than Chuck E Cheeseand that's how they authenticate with  <br>00:11:49.950 each other.  <br>00:11:50.400 So when we deploy this docker runcommand baked in with these Chucky cheese  <br>00:11:54.460 tokens and when the twin Gateconnector came up in our network,  <br>00:11:57.280 he talked to the controller and said,Hey, here I am. Here's my tokens.  <br>00:12:00.460 And they, they were friendsnow cuz he knew who he was.  <br>00:12:02.890 So he gives him thetokens and then exchange.  <br>00:12:04.660 The controller tells a connectoreverything he needs to know.  <br>00:12:07.420 Two really important thingswe're gonna focus on right now.  <br>00:12:09.570 First is an ACL and access control list.  <br>00:12:12.460 This tells the connector who'sallowed to come into the network.  <br>00:12:14.830 It's a list of allowed devices andwhat they're allowed to access.  <br>00:12:17.320 We define that. Remember wedid that inside the controller.  <br>00:12:19.660 So the controller's givingthe connector that list,  <br>00:12:21.940 he's also telling him about Mr. Relay.  <br>00:12:24.370 Remember Twin Gate has four componentsand this is the fourth one we have not  <br>00:12:27.490 talked about yet. So thecontroller says, Hey,  <br>00:12:28.936 here's a few relays that youcan connect to. Now the relays,  <br>00:12:32.170 I'll tell you more about whatthose are here in a moment.  <br>00:12:33.790 Much like the controller,  <br>00:12:34.630 they're hosted inside Twin Gates networkso you don't have to worry about it.  <br>00:12:37.870 I'll put the relaysright here in my beard.  <br>00:12:40.150 Now the relay's job is simple butsuper important. He's the matchmaker.  <br>00:12:43.960 He helps the client,  <br>00:12:45.010 my knucklehead video editors andthe connector discovery each other,  <br>00:12:48.340 find out how to meet. He'sthe guy that does that.  <br>00:12:50.710 The kind of play in love is blind rightnow they're talking behind a wall.  <br>00:12:53.530 Let's take down that wall.  <br>00:12:57.040 Just a hug.  <br>00:12:58.140 Now here's how the clientand the connector connect.  <br>00:13:00.670 The first thing that'll happenis the connector will connect.  <br>00:13:03.430 He's such a connector.  <br>00:13:04.720 He'll connect with a relay and he guesseswhat he uses to authenticate a  <br>00:13:08.620 token. It's actually a token from thecontroller to say, Hey, I know this guy,  <br>00:13:13.360 we both know him. We're friends, we'regood. Not on the flip side, the client,  <br>00:13:17.290 it's doing the same thing.  <br>00:13:18.460 It did the whole token thing of thecontroller when it authenticated and it  <br>00:13:21.940 connects to a relay.  <br>00:13:23.200 So now that the client and theconnector are talking to the relay,  <br>00:13:25.810 the relay can now introducethem. He's the matchmaker,  <br>00:13:28.330 but he's doing more than you might thinkcuz there's a pretty big problem he's  <br>00:13:31.065 solving right now. And thisis why we even need a relay.  <br>00:13:33.550 The problem is that the devices in yournetwork are nestled safely behind a  <br>00:13:36.940 firewall or a router and they're somewhatkind of sheltered from the internet.  <br>00:13:40.540 The internet can't touch them. Andthat's by design. That's a good thing.  <br>00:13:42.796 Your devices don't evenhave a public IP address,  <br>00:13:45.160 which is what they need to talkto everyone on the internet.  <br>00:13:47.710 Usually your router is the one that hasthe public IP address and he allows the  <br>00:13:51.645 devices on your network. So thinkyou're nas, your twin gate connector,  <br>00:13:56.050 your editing PCs.  <br>00:13:57.190 He allows those devices to use thepublic IP whenever they want to talk to  <br>00:14:01.090 people. This is a magical technologycalled nat or network address translation.  <br>00:14:05.290 So what this means is thatyour computer, for example,  <br>00:14:07.240 has no problem talking to the internetwhen it tries to go out and talk to a  <br>00:14:10.780 website. The router will letit use its public IP address.  <br>00:14:14.320 It'll actually give it alittle identifier, a port,  <br>00:14:16.870 let's say 5 1 7 90 with that identifierthat port your computer can talk to  <br>00:14:21.880 any website it wants. It works great.  <br>00:14:23.530 And when the website wants to send aphoto back or a meme or whatever you're  <br>00:14:26.530 doing, it knows that this camefrom 1 5, 9, 7 4, 1, 2, 2, 1 1 3,  <br>00:14:31.540 port 51, 7, 9, 0.  <br>00:14:33.880 So when it talks back to yourcomputer and it gets to your router,  <br>00:14:37.570 your router goes, oh, this is 4507 90. When they get that right to 'em.  <br>00:14:41.740 Now Nat and these randomly assigned portsare great for your computer to connect  <br>00:14:45.370 to stuff on the internet,but not great at all.  <br>00:14:47.710 for things to connect back to it.  <br>00:14:49.810 So the Twin Gate client can'tstart talking to your computer.  <br>00:14:52.790 There's no door open there. Andthat's where the relays come in.  <br>00:14:55.430 The relay does something really cleverand it's so cool when you really think  <br>00:14:58.460 about it.  <br>00:14:58.760 So you know the example I gave you ofyour computer connecting to a website and  <br>00:15:02.300 using a randomly assigned port using that.  <br>00:15:04.400 It uses that to build thatpeer-to-peer connection. So watch this,  <br>00:15:07.646 your connector inside your network,it's connected to the relay, right?  <br>00:15:11.300 We've got a connection,  <br>00:15:12.230 which means he's gonna have a public IPand a randomly assigned port from Nat  <br>00:15:16.765 from your router.  <br>00:15:17.570 So IP and port and the relay knowsthat because he has that connection.  <br>00:15:21.230 On the other side of things,you using the Twin Gate client,  <br>00:15:24.410 you're probably using Nat toowifi at Starbucks airport,  <br>00:15:27.350 some secret YouTuberstudio, whatever it is.  <br>00:15:29.750 So you get your public IP and theyrandomly assign port and the client has a  <br>00:15:33.500 connection with the relay. Soright at this moment, look at this,  <br>00:15:36.530 the relay has a connection withthe connector and the client,  <br>00:15:39.710 he knows their public IP addresses andhe knows the port that Nats using to  <br>00:15:43.490 reach back to them. So the relay goes,lemme just tell them where they are.  <br>00:15:48.110 Let me,  <br>00:15:48.290 let me tell both these guys where theyare so they can talk to each other.  <br>00:15:51.080 And that's exactly what happens.The relay tells the client, Hey,  <br>00:15:54.230 if you want to talk to the connector,here's his IP address in port.  <br>00:15:57.140 And he tells the connector, Hey,if you wanna talk to the client,  <br>00:15:59.330 here's his IP address in port. Andwith that magic information supplied,  <br>00:16:03.830 bam, we get a connection.  <br>00:16:05.570 They know how to find each other ina secure end-to-end TLS tunnel is  <br>00:16:10.010 established. Now thismagic does have a name,  <br>00:16:12.440 it's called Nat Traversal because we'retraversing all these NAT servers to make  <br>00:16:17.305 a direct connection,  <br>00:16:18.140 which is pretty hard to do when thingsare kind of hidden behind random ports.  <br>00:16:21.640 That's why we need a server like a relay.  <br>00:16:24.740 This is actually operatingas a stun server.  <br>00:16:26.870 Stun does this kind of stuff and itfacilitates those connections. Whoa,  <br>00:16:30.710 why is there a virus onthis pc? Let me remove that,  <br>00:16:33.680 how embarrassing I left that there.  <br>00:16:35.990 Now a couple of things about howthis connection business works.  <br>00:16:39.320 A couple of highlights. Thisthing is secure. Like I said,  <br>00:16:42.320 twin Gate is using moretokens than Chuck E. Cheese.  <br>00:16:44.510 Every single interaction wasauthenticated with a token.  <br>00:16:47.900 This TLS tunnel is usingpenned certificates,  <br>00:16:50.630 which makes it darn near impossibleto do a man in the middle attack.  <br>00:16:53.540 And honestly, I'm not doing it justice.  <br>00:16:55.070 If you wanna dive deeper into how likeall the authentication and tokenizing  <br>00:16:58.640 stuff is working, I've gottadocument below, check it out.  <br>00:17:01.640 The second thing is that this isnot a VPN n I mentioned it before.  <br>00:17:05.240 So you're probably like, wellChuck, if it's not vpn, what is it?  <br>00:17:07.460 It's a proxy actually.  <br>00:17:08.630 It's a super secure private proxy andspecifically the connector inside your  <br>00:17:12.770 network is operating it as a proxy.  <br>00:17:15.230 They work by terminatingnetwork connections andthey'll do some fancy stuff for  <br>00:17:18.530 that traffic. They'llmanipulate it, validate it,  <br>00:17:20.599 and forward the traffic on to itscorrect destination. It's very,  <br>00:17:23.720 very programmable and and custom. Thethird thing I want you to know is, uh,  <br>00:17:27.380 this sucker's quick and no,  <br>00:17:29.120 I didn't forget how to spell Quick is a new protocol.  <br>00:17:32.060 If you haven't heard of this.  <br>00:17:32.950 It's a transport layer protocol forall your network uh, nerds out there.  <br>00:17:36.230 It's built on top of U udp and it'sdesigned to be faster and more efficient  <br>00:17:40.760 than tcp, which is likewait, you're building on topof UDP to beat TCP ?  <br>00:17:45.500 Sure, but that's what it does. Now,quick is taking the internet by storm.  <br>00:17:49.200 You're probably already using it rightnow if you did a wire shark capture.  <br>00:17:51.540 But here's some of the maindifferences that makes it amazing.  <br>00:17:54.390 One of them is multiplexing.Multiplexing is a big one.  <br>00:17:57.390 You can send multiple streams of dataover one connection versus this rush hour  <br>00:18:01.380 freeway up here that's tcp.  <br>00:18:03.360 And what this means for Twin Gate andwhy it's so quick to make connections is  <br>00:18:06.990 that it can make a connection offand everything in one round trip.  <br>00:18:11.100 Whereas with TCP it might be a bunchof back and forth negotiations and  <br>00:18:15.870 time and remitted packetsand all kinds of stuff.  <br>00:18:18.240 And one really cool thing that quickdoes, and this is kind of mind blowing,  <br>00:18:22.080 but it does client sideroaming or it facilitates that.  <br>00:18:24.690 So let's say you as a client are tryingto remain connected to a remote desktop  <br>00:18:28.080 session or you're watching a movie onPlex and you go from wifi in your house to  <br>00:18:31.560 maybe you're in the car on 5g.  <br>00:18:33.660 Normally that switch and connectionrequires a disconnect and reconnect quick  <br>00:18:37.775 just keeps connection up. Theconnection survives. It's kind of crazy.  <br>00:18:41.280 And then one more thing to note backhaul with traditional V P N when you  <br>00:18:44.700 connect,  <br>00:18:45.300 it normally means every bit of trafficyou're generating whatever website you go  <br>00:18:48.990 to, whether it's on your privatenetwork or on the internet,  <br>00:18:52.230 it's gonna go through that VPN N device.  <br>00:18:55.200 Literally everything you're doingis going through the VPN N device.  <br>00:18:57.810 That's bad for a varietyof reasons. First of all,  <br>00:18:59.375 you may not want to have everythingyou're doing be seen by that VPN N device.  <br>00:19:02.220 All you wanted was accessto some resources. Second,  <br>00:19:04.950 as an IT person is a person tryingto administer a VPN gateway, dude,  <br>00:19:08.310 that's a lot of extra traffic thatyou're having to grow your firewall for.  <br>00:19:12.030 It's really inefficient.  <br>00:19:13.020 But with Twin Gate it does a thingcalled Split tunnel by default,  <br>00:19:16.020 which means that only traffic destinedfor the resources you want access,  <br>00:19:20.430 go through a twin gate, everythingelse, Facebook, YouTube, it goes out.  <br>00:19:23.825 Your standard internet gatewaydoesn't touch twin gay.  <br>00:19:26.310 So only the traffic that needs to goacross those security t l s tunnels,  <br>00:19:30.870 those end-to-end tunnels,  <br>00:19:32.490 the only traffic that goes across thoseis traffic that's supposed to for those  <br>00:19:35.430 resources. Now, yes, you can configureSplit Tunnel with a lot of V P N.  <br>00:19:39.270 I've done it. It's not easy. Twin Gate is built in by default.  <br>00:19:43.590 You don't have to even think aboutit. It just works like that. Okay,  <br>00:19:45.750 we popped the hood, wesaw some nerdy stuff.  <br>00:19:47.760 Now time to configure some nerdy thingsstarting with something really cool.  <br>00:19:51.540 Device security. Now back here in ourtwin gate controller, aka twin [gate.com](http://gate.com/),  <br>00:19:55.830 let's do a few things real quick. First,  <br>00:19:57.570 we're actually gonna add to ourteam by clicking on team up here,  <br>00:20:00.330 adding to your team is real easy. Ifyou wanna add family, friends, whatever,  <br>00:20:03.420 I'll click on add user, I'll addmyself to this team, send invite email.  <br>00:20:07.710 And what I'll also do is configurea group. So I'll click on groups,  <br>00:20:10.440 add a group and say Beards,that's it. Add group.  <br>00:20:13.590 And then I'll jump into that group, clickon users and add myself to that group.  <br>00:20:16.620 Now here I'm connecting on myphone and you can see I'm on 5g.  <br>00:20:19.980 Now I'm connecting through justfine, everything's loading.  <br>00:20:21.930 But now let's play with device security.  <br>00:20:23.520 So at the top I'll click ondevices and first of all,  <br>00:20:25.590 it's pretty cool that you cansee every device connected,  <br>00:20:27.870 but what we care about is securityright here. Let's click on that here.  <br>00:20:30.930 We can configure security based onminimum OS requirements. So for example,  <br>00:20:35.220 I may not want iOS allowed at all.  <br>00:20:38.370 So I can go in here and say Block [iOS.So](http://ios.so/) now when I try to log into Twin Gate,  <br>00:20:43.350 I've got iOS blocked, I can'teven authenticate, I can't get in.  <br>00:20:46.740 So you block an entire OS or just enforcegood policies like hey, screen lock,  <br>00:20:51.340 let's make sure we have screen lockand maybe like biometric configuration.  <br>00:20:54.520 So touch ID if you still have that faceid, things like that. Heck yeah, Linux,  <br>00:20:58.720 HD encryption, firewall, windows,goodness gracious, enable the whole thing.  <br>00:21:02.920 So that's already super powerful. Also,  <br>00:21:04.630 you'll see we have the optionto create a trusted profile.  <br>00:21:07.060 Let me show you what thatis. The click on create.  <br>00:21:09.010 Let's say we'll do one for Windows.  <br>00:21:10.360 Notice here we have theoption to integrate with thirdparty endpoint protection  <br>00:21:14.320 stuff, CrowdStrike, Intune, Sentinel One.  <br>00:21:16.540 And you can rely on those super advancedprograms to tell you if those devices  <br>00:21:19.930 are safe to connect. And ifthey're not trusted by those,  <br>00:21:22.190 then they're not trusted byTwin Gates. That's pretty cool.  <br>00:21:26.020 Now we also have policieswhere you can define policies.  <br>00:21:28.960 The main thing I want you to see inpolicies is the MFA not required.  <br>00:21:31.935 Over here you can just straight offthe bat make sure that MFA multifactor  <br>00:21:35.740 authentication is required.  <br>00:21:37.450 And then going into policies youcan set further requirements.  <br>00:21:40.300 Like if you set the defaultpolicy for device security,  <br>00:21:43.030 you can manage that to say,Hey, only trusted devices,  <br>00:21:45.555 meaning they have to be trustedby CrowdStrike in TuneIn all one.  <br>00:21:49.870 Or you can leave it at any deviceas long as they meet device security  <br>00:21:52.330 requirements, the minimumOS requirements you've set.  <br>00:21:54.580 Now I wanna move on to something prettyfun and it's how Twin Gate handles and  <br>00:21:58.270 treats dns. It's kind of crazy.  <br>00:22:00.380 So let's get back up tothe network tab over here.  <br>00:22:02.830 I don't need to switch to my pen.Ah, there we go. We'll go to network.  <br>00:22:05.860 And so far we've added a resourceby specifying the IP address.  <br>00:22:09.160 Like here's the IP Twin Gatewill take care of the rest.  <br>00:22:12.010 But we also saw how we could use DNS adomain name. Let's try it out real quick.  <br>00:22:15.940 So here in my network I'vegot a Prox Box server.  <br>00:22:19.330 It's great for hosting virtual machines.  <br>00:22:21.010 You can find it via DNS atprox dot hogwarts dot local.  <br>00:22:25.810 Now keeping in mind, thisis via my local DNS server.  <br>00:22:28.840 So here in my studio and maybe inyour network or your business network,  <br>00:22:32.290 you have a DNS [server.So](http://server.so/) when I ping prox max,  <br>00:22:36.010 it replies to the IP address becausemy private DNS server response,  <br>00:22:39.610 this is not accessibleon the big wild internet.  <br>00:22:42.280 Now how Twin Gate will useyour DNS servers crazy.  <br>00:22:44.950 But let's go ahead and add it real quick.  <br>00:22:46.120 So I'm gonna have my newemployee I created, which was me.  <br>00:22:48.940 I think I'm gonna have me access Proxbox. So we'll click on ad resource,  <br>00:22:53.980 we'll choose a remote network. We'llonly have one right now. We'll do dns,  <br>00:22:56.500 we'll label it. And thenI'll put in the DNS address,  <br>00:22:58.630 which is proxima dot hogwarts dot local.  <br>00:23:01.930 Notice I'm not telling it what IPaddress that it is or anything like that.  <br>00:23:06.040 I'm just saying the DNS address,the domain name for protocol.  <br>00:23:08.830 I'll allow everything just fortesting. And then I'll say only beards.  <br>00:23:12.670 Only beards can use this. So I haveone group, which is just gonna be me.  <br>00:23:16.180 Now first let's see if it worksbecause I don't wanna lie to you.  <br>00:23:18.700 I wanna get logged back in. I got loggedout. Oh I forgot I enforced mfa. Ugh,  <br>00:23:23.950 I'm gonna turn it off real quick. ,I don't feel like doing it right now.  <br>00:23:27.220 That's just bad security. Okay, cool.  <br>00:23:28.960 So I see Product Moss hereand currently I'm on 5g,  <br>00:23:31.300 so I'm not on my home network.  <br>00:23:32.860 I'm gonna authenticate and then copythe address and try to go to it.  <br>00:23:36.070 I'll do https, colon wwa,  <br>00:23:38.560 paste it in there and go to pour 8,006for Prox Max proceed. And there we go.  <br>00:23:43.510 Just like that. Lemme show youhow that, here's my network,  <br>00:23:46.250 here's my Prox MO server andhere's my uh, DNS server,  <br>00:23:50.090 which is actually running on a raspberrypie. It's agar. I highly recommend it.  <br>00:23:53.690 What's crazy is that the TwinGate connector, he does a lot,  <br>00:23:57.080 but what he also doesbeyond everything else,  <br>00:23:59.450 well not beyond just also isthat he proxies DNS request.  <br>00:24:04.160 He's a DNS proxy. Andhere's what that means.  <br>00:24:06.290 So me over here on my Twin Gateclient, I got Twin Gate on my phone.  <br>00:24:09.710 There's something kind of weird going onwith your Twin Gate client and by weird  <br>00:24:12.685 I mean awesome. This is the only timeI'll mention it using VPN by the way,  <br>00:24:16.730 it actually uses a VPN connection onyour phone and whatever device you're  <br>00:24:20.810 using, it's a VPNconnection to local host.  <br>00:24:24.500 So 1 2 7 0 0 1,  <br>00:24:28.250 which we all know that local host onetwo seven zero zero one is itself.  <br>00:24:31.940 It's the phone itself.  <br>00:24:32.990 It's making a VPN connection back toitself that has one purpose of Twin Gate.  <br>00:24:37.040 It's listening and waiting for attemptsto connect to resources and it's a acl.  <br>00:24:41.300 So it has a list of things that itknows I'm allowed to connect to,  <br>00:24:44.240 blah blah blah blah blah. One ofthose things being proxim max,  <br>00:24:46.970 it waits and listens and it goes,oh, oh, that's for me Proxim Max.  <br>00:24:50.210 It watches everything. And when it seesit's something meant for Twin Gate,  <br>00:24:53.900 it'll take it and send it to the TwinGate connector over its secure TLS Tunnel.  <br>00:24:57.470 Now in the case of dns, what it'll do is,  <br>00:24:59.330 you know we configured a resourcethat's prox box dot hogwarts dot  <br>00:25:03.920 local. When it sees proxbox dot hogwarts dot local,  <br>00:25:06.800 it's like okay that's in my list.  <br>00:25:08.600 It will then send this over our secureTLS connection TLS Tunnel to the Twin  <br>00:25:12.920 Gate connector and the connector willresolve that DNS request with its own  <br>00:25:16.880 configured DNS [server.So](http://server.so/) think about that.  <br>00:25:18.830 My twin gate connector that'ssitting inside my network,  <br>00:25:21.110 I gave it it's DNS server, whichis my private DNS server here.  <br>00:25:24.050 That's what it's using to resolve anyof those domain names I configure inside  <br>00:25:28.310 Twin Gate. That's pretty cool.  <br>00:25:29.390 And what that empowers me to do is DNSbase routing to different networks,  <br>00:25:33.950 which I don't think any othersolution does. It's kind of crazy.  <br>00:25:37.730 Now that's cool, but what if you don'thave a DNS server in your house? Well,  <br>00:25:40.820 twin Gate has a new feature calledAlias sis. Let's try it out real quick.  <br>00:25:44.300 Let's add another resource. Iwanna connect to my Plex server.  <br>00:25:46.490 So remote network hack WorldTech,I'll do a an IP address, the alias,  <br>00:25:49.670 I can make it whatever I want itto be. Plex dot beards dot awesome.  <br>00:25:53.720 I don't know that's what it's gonna be.  <br>00:25:54.950 I will only allow port 32,400 for Plex and that's it.  <br>00:25:59.330 I'll give me access Beards ofcourse. And that's the Plex server.  <br>00:26:03.170 Let's see if that alias works.If this works be kind of crazy,  <br>00:26:06.530 let's go to plex dot, beards dot awesome.  <br>00:26:10.460 Port 3 2 400. Is it working?Seems to be working.  <br>00:26:15.890 It worked. How cool is that?  <br>00:26:17.960 Now a couple of things incase you didn't notice this,  <br>00:26:20.330 you don't have to addjust individual resources.  <br>00:26:22.640 If you wanted to add a oneresource and make that a wild card,  <br>00:26:25.850 so either an IP address, saylike my network, do a slash 24,  <br>00:26:30.630 make that one resource and youget access to your entire network.  <br>00:26:33.560 Same goes for dns, which is prettystinking cool. Just do a wild card.  <br>00:26:36.890 I use this heavily by the way. And it'sso stinking cool. Makes things easy.  <br>00:26:40.070 At least for me.  <br>00:26:40.790 Like I only give myself access tothis and restrict everyone else.  <br>00:26:44.400 It just makes sense. Nowbecause this video is so long,  <br>00:26:46.740 I'm not gonna demo these last few things,  <br>00:26:48.210 but I just wanna touch on them real quickbecause they're so powerful and I do  <br>00:26:50.970 use them. If I go overto my team, we the top,  <br>00:26:54.600 I've got users groups and then there'sone thing I haven't talked about.  <br>00:26:57.270 And that's services. What is that?Click on that. Nothing there.  <br>00:27:01.350 What this is though, it's so cool.  <br>00:27:03.750 You've seen how we can install a TwinGate cloud on your phone, laptop,  <br>00:27:07.080 whatever. But they also haveheadless clients. They got no heads,  <br>00:27:11.550 which means you can install them on aLinux server with one command and they  <br>00:27:15.845 just work and it's so cool. SoI did this with um, uptime Kuma.  <br>00:27:21.030 So I had a LE server in the cloud.  <br>00:27:23.190 I installed Uptime Kuma on that and Iinstalled the Twin Gate headless client on  <br>00:27:26.760 there. And with that it was able tomonitor everything in my private network.  <br>00:27:31.830 And actually I lied. It wasn't myprivate network that was monitoring,  <br>00:27:34.530 I was actually doing the top secretYouTube thing I talked to you about.  <br>00:27:37.560 I was using this exact setupto monitor a couple hun. Uh,  <br>00:27:41.760 I can't tell you it was a lot of devices,but it did it like Twin Gate handle,  <br>00:27:45.150 all that. It was a wild car DNS [setup.It](http://setup.it/) was crazy. But services are cool.  <br>00:27:49.980 They're not the hardestsetup. It's a one-liner.  <br>00:27:51.630 Now what this also opensup is C I C D automation.  <br>00:27:55.350 And you can use things like Terraform where you can like just deploy  <br>00:27:59.015 infrastructure and with the infrastructurebuilt in the Terraform template,  <br>00:28:03.510 is that what they call it?I think it's a template,  <br>00:28:04.740 is deploying twin gate connectorsand headless clients and it just,  <br>00:28:09.450 you spin up things [automatically.It](http://automatically.it/)'s kind of crazy.  <br>00:28:12.510 So you can automate your access, automateyour zero trust. Two more things.  <br>00:28:16.200 If I go over to settings I,twin Gate's, a big thing, man.  <br>00:28:18.720 Two things you can look atright now. Identity provider,  <br>00:28:21.030 you can sync up GoogleWorkspace, Okta Azure ad.  <br>00:28:23.940 I personally use Google Workspace.Pretty cool. I sync up my employees.  <br>00:28:27.810 You can also do Secure dns.  <br>00:28:29.490 So you can actually have your clientsuse a secure DNS provider using D O H and  <br>00:28:33.450 you can specify that here. Sothat's Twin Gate. What do you think?  <br>00:28:36.240 Are you gonna throw away your VPN or areyou using something else that you think  <br>00:28:39.185 is better fighting? No, I'mjust kidding. But seriously,  <br>00:28:41.190 let me know below in the comments.I wanna know what you think.  <br>00:28:43.590 Grandma, go subscribe to Network.

(free)  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/DbF96IHOZig](https://www.youtube.com/watch/DbF96IHOZig)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.000 You've gotta see this tool. It's nuts.I can finally monitor all my stuff,  <br>00:00:04.540 all of it websites, DNS servers likeAgar game servers, raspberry pies.  <br>00:00:08.960 My kids don't make controllers.Everything in my home lab,  <br>00:00:11.600 everything in my cloud, I can see ifit's up and running or if it goes down,  <br>00:00:15.630 I finally feel like I know what's goingon and I don't even have to look at it.  <br>00:00:19.400 It'll just tell me Slack, discord,whatever this is uptime kua.  <br>00:00:23.920 A monitoring tool you cannotbelieve is free. And honestly,  <br>00:00:26.800 I would've killed four back in the day.Two reasons. You're going to love this.  <br>00:00:30.140 One, it's free. Two, it's beautiful.Come on, look at all this. And I lied.  <br>00:00:35.040 Three reasons. Three, it'sreally easy to set up.  <br>00:00:37.640 You're gonna host it yourself and by thetime you're done, you'll be like, wait,  <br>00:00:40.400 that was it. Not kidding. Five minutes.Get your stinking coffee ready.  <br>00:00:43.800 Let's do this. Now first you gottadecide where are you going to put uptime?  <br>00:00:47.640 Kuma, you got two choices. One the cloud.And number two, inside your home lab.  <br>00:00:51.800 Your home network.  <br>00:00:52.440 Now inside is cool because you caneasily monitor all your home lab stuff  <br>00:00:55.560 without even thinking about it. You don'thave to poke holes in that firewall.  <br>00:00:57.980 And you'll need somewhere to host Uptime,Kua, some kind of Linux based server,  <br>00:01:01.320 like a Raspberry Pie, a spare laptopor an enterprise grade server.  <br>00:01:04.239 But once you got a place to put it,  <br>00:01:05.560 installing is stupid easy cuz we'regonna use Docker. And Docker is amazing.  <br>00:01:08.880 It would be like that coffee breakthat's, that's how long it'll take Arrow,  <br>00:01:12.760 Chuck. Now the cloud is cooltoo. You put it up there,  <br>00:01:15.620 you don't really need anything.  <br>00:01:16.920 You can set it up right now as you'rewatching this video and just kind of play  <br>00:01:19.520 with it, just like see if it's cool.  <br>00:01:21.040 And if you use one of my favorite cloudproviders and the sponsor of this video  <br>00:01:24.130 LE Node, it'll cost you almostnothing like 0.08 cents an hour.  <br>00:01:28.170 Or if you're new to Le Node,  <br>00:01:29.240 it'll be free because they giveyou $100 credit for 60 days. I,  <br>00:01:33.360 that's just do it.  <br>00:01:35.450 So put it in the cloud and you canmonitor everything on the interwebs.  <br>00:01:38.520 You just might have a bit of a problemmonitoring your home lab stuff. Now me,  <br>00:01:41.790 I do both. I've got uptime,  <br>00:01:43.280 coma sitting right next to me in myhome lab monitoring all the things.  <br>00:01:46.080 But I also have one in thecloud redundancy also, I,  <br>00:01:48.560 I monitor my home network to see ifit stays up. Whatever you choose,  <br>00:01:51.160 it doesn't matter. I'm gonna show youboth and it's, it's pretty stink and easy.  <br>00:01:54.000 I'll start with the cloud because ittakes like three seconds and you can't go  <br>00:01:56.640 wrong with LE node. I got a link below.Head over to le [node.com/network](http://node.com/network). Chuck,  <br>00:02:00.440 again, if you're new, you'llget a $100 credit for 60 days.  <br>00:02:03.680 And once you're signed in,click on create the node.  <br>00:02:06.820 Now why this will be so fast isbecause they have a marketplace.  <br>00:02:09.520 Go and click on that and it's gonnabe like, where is it? abcV, oh,  <br>00:02:13.800 uptime Kuma right there. Just selectit, scroll down a bit, put in some info.  <br>00:02:17.520 Email address, limitedpseudo user info, password.  <br>00:02:20.740 You can skip over the DNS stuffif you don't want to use it,  <br>00:02:23.280 I'm not gonna use it rightnow. Select your region,  <br>00:02:25.190 I'll be in Dallas close to me. Andthen pick the size of your LE node,  <br>00:02:28.720 your server. I'm gonna doshared CPU nano one gigabyte,  <br>00:02:31.360 which is five bucks a month or0.01 cents an hour. So seriously,  <br>00:02:35.040 if you wanna try this out, justspin this up, play it for an hour,  <br>00:02:37.800 then delete it and you're charged thatmuch like that's it. Then label it.  <br>00:02:42.200 And dude, that's it.  <br>00:02:43.240 Click on create and take a little coffeebreak cuz you just set up a monitoring  <br>00:02:47.040 service that's gonna take a fewminutes to get baked and ready.  <br>00:02:49.480 So while it's baking,  <br>00:02:50.200 let me show you how to do the on-premsetup in the home lab. So for on-prem,  <br>00:02:54.320 I'm gonna get connectedto my on-prem server.  <br>00:02:56.480 We're gonna launch CMDon Windows Terminal.  <br>00:02:58.800 On Mac and Linux, SSH andSumi server. And I'm in.  <br>00:03:02.160 Now this install will depend on twothings, Docker and Docker compose.  <br>00:03:05.640 Let's make sure we havethose installed right now.  <br>00:03:07.440 Pseudo apt install docker.iodash y. I'm already good.  <br>00:03:11.880 Yours might take a minute. Justtake a little coffee break. Next.  <br>00:03:14.000 Docker compose. Pseudo a PT.Install Docker dash compos dash y.  <br>00:03:18.720 Now that was the hard part. Now watchDucker compose. Just do its thing.  <br>00:03:22.000 You ready? The first thing we'lldo is make a new directory, MK dir.  <br>00:03:25.230 I'll call it Makua. And thenwe'll CD into that CD Makua.  <br>00:03:29.460 And then we'll create one file.  <br>00:03:30.800 I'm gonna use Nano cause Nano is thebest fight me. Come on. Just kidding.  <br>00:03:35.220 But really I lost mytrade of thought. Nano.  <br>00:03:37.400 We'll call this dockerdash compose dot y ml.  <br>00:03:41.060 And here we're just gonna copyand paste. I got some code below.  <br>00:03:43.960 I'm gonna grab mine. I believe thisis the official stuff from Lewis Lamb,  <br>00:03:47.320 the creator of Uptime Kuma. Thatdude's amazing. Thank you Lewis.  <br>00:03:51.830 I love your tool. Now real quick,  <br>00:03:53.360 here's all we're doing withthe Docker composed file.  <br>00:03:55.200 First we're pulling the officialcontainer image from Lewis Lamb for uptime  <br>00:03:58.400 Kuma. Then we're naming itUptime Kuma. And then right here,  <br>00:04:00.960 this is very important.  <br>00:04:01.840 We're mapping a volume to make sure thatour uptime coma data is persistent even  <br>00:04:06.400 if we tear down that containerand build it back up.  <br>00:04:08.280 And then finally we expose some ports.  <br>00:04:10.330 So now that we know what we're doing andwe have a little sip of coffee, right,  <br>00:04:13.400 let's go ahead and hit control X,Y enter to save and check the out.  <br>00:04:18.200 This is all we have to do. Type in docker,  <br>00:04:20.769 compose up dash D. That'sit. You ready? .  <br>00:04:25.820 Now that was faster for me cuz Ialready had the image downloaded.  <br>00:04:28.560 It'll probably download the image for you.  <br>00:04:30.120 It'll be fairly quick And it'srunning If we do a little docker Ps,  <br>00:04:34.640 there he is, he's right there.  <br>00:04:36.090 So now all we have to do is navigate tothe IP address of our container on Port  <br>00:04:40.680 3001. Let's try it out. And here we areready to get set up. Now on LE node,  <br>00:04:45.230 it's even easier if youlook back at your LE node,  <br>00:04:47.920 all you need to do is go to the networksettings under your lin node settings  <br>00:04:52.200 stuff and scroll down just a bit untilyou see the reverse DNS information right  <br>00:04:56.880 here. That's basically a free DNSname you get if you copy that bad boy  <br>00:05:02.020 and paste that into a new tab.Uptime kua, you're ready to go.  <br>00:05:05.800 Now for the remainder of this lab, Iwill continue on my home lab setup.  <br>00:05:08.880 However, it'll be the exact sameas the cloud. So just follow along,  <br>00:05:12.560 get your username and stuff setup. You know how to do this stuff.  <br>00:05:15.400 Password in and click on create mypasswords don't match. Okay, there we go.  <br>00:05:19.980 Now here it is Uptime kua.  <br>00:05:21.720 And what you're gonna love about this ishow simple it is. Like what do you say,  <br>00:05:24.480 we monitor something right now. Let'sdo it right now we have nothing.  <br>00:05:26.720 So we'll click on add a new monitor. Andif you're new to enterprise monitoring,  <br>00:05:30.080 which is just crazy to say that we haveenterprise monitoring and our home lab.  <br>00:05:33.000 Come on guys, if you're new to it, wehave different types. If we look at 'em,  <br>00:05:36.360 there's a lot. And what you'll usedepends on what you need it for right now.  <br>00:05:39.200 What do you say? We monitor [networkchuck.com](http://networkchuck.com/). So we'll choose http,  <br>00:05:42.550 dual friendly name, put in the url.  <br>00:05:44.690 We can change how often we wantto check sixty's too long for me.  <br>00:05:47.800 Let's do like 30 or something better.  <br>00:05:50.080 You can tell it to retry a few moretimes before it considers it down.  <br>00:05:53.000 Zero's fine for me. I want it to be upall the time. Tell me when it's not up.  <br>00:05:56.120 And you got a few more values. Values.Let's jump on down to advanced.  <br>00:05:58.560 And this is pretty cool. Ifyou're monitoring your website,  <br>00:06:00.680 it's good to know if your certificate'sgoing to expire. This will tell you.  <br>00:06:04.240 Click that sucker. Also,  <br>00:06:05.360 if you're monitoring a website insideyour home lab that has a self-signed cert,  <br>00:06:08.640 you can tell it to ignore SSLcertificates, but I don't need that.  <br>00:06:11.840 And then no matter whatmonitor you choose,  <br>00:06:13.240 you'll always have the upside downloadas an option. Which essentially means,  <br>00:06:16.440 hey, is your service down? Then it'sup. Often you probably won't need it,  <br>00:06:19.880 but there are use cases. Now everythingelse you really don't need to change.  <br>00:06:22.800 But I do wanna point outhow powerful this tool is.  <br>00:06:25.260 You can tell it what statuscodes it'll accept as up.  <br>00:06:28.840 Now these are all HTTP status codesand by default it's gonna say, Hey,  <br>00:06:32.080 if we get anything in the 200 range,  <br>00:06:33.520 we're okay because 200 okay isthe best message in the world.  <br>00:06:37.000 That's what happens when you go toa website and it's up and running,  <br>00:06:39.360 you try to pull up a homepagelike network [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/).  <br>00:06:41.560 And if network [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/) is thereand alive and active and working,  <br>00:06:45.080 it'll send back all your good stuff.The homepage along with the 200.  <br>00:06:49.440 Okay message. Anything elsethat we might have a problem.  <br>00:06:51.480 And in case you're curious,  <br>00:06:53.160 anything in the 400 rangeas far as response codes goindicates there's an issue  <br>00:06:57.320 with the client, which is you,the problem's, you, your computer,  <br>00:07:00.400 the way it's trying to receiveinformation. Anything in the 500 range,  <br>00:07:03.880 it's a problem with thesite, it's a server issue,  <br>00:07:05.800 which if you're hosting your ownwebsite, the problem's still you .  <br>00:07:08.520 But yeah, that's what it tells you.  <br>00:07:10.360 Actually that's a nugget you wanna storein your pocket for pretty much anything  <br>00:07:13.200 in it, not just uptime kuma.Remember these things. Now again,  <br>00:07:16.600 most of the time 200 to okay iswhat you want to get. But again,  <br>00:07:19.640 just to kind of touch on the power ofthis thing, if you scroll up a bit more,  <br>00:07:22.680 you can control the http options. Youcan say I want the get post put patch,  <br>00:07:26.800 delete crud, all the stuff. Youcan do that, which is just amazing.  <br>00:07:29.960 But by default this will probablydo what you needed to do.  <br>00:07:32.440 But if you're more advanced youcan go crazy. That's all we need.  <br>00:07:35.240 I'm gonna click on save. And immediatelyit starts monitoring your stuff.  <br>00:07:39.000 Right now it already said,Hey, you're up, Chuck up Chuck.  <br>00:07:42.350 I hate when people say that. Don'tcomment it below, please don't do that.  <br>00:07:45.320 Now do you see how wonderful this is?Not only is it telling us that we're up,  <br>00:07:49.110 it's giving us response times abeautiful graph of response times.  <br>00:07:53.080 How quickly is your websiteresponding? Is it healthy?  <br>00:07:55.440 There's my expirations information.Oh dude, I love this so much, dude,  <br>00:07:59.560 why is my response timeso bad for my website?  <br>00:08:01.640 So you have your first monitorset up. What do you say?  <br>00:08:03.640 We set up another one real quickcause I wanna show you something. Now,  <br>00:08:05.920 website monitoring is cool and thefact that you can do an http monitor is  <br>00:08:09.760 awesome. But did you notice we haveanother option in the monitor? Type.  <br>00:08:12.560 Check this out. We have http withkeyword. What? What does that mean?  <br>00:08:17.170 It means something. Awesome. Let's try,what do you say we monitor network.  <br>00:08:19.880 chuck.coffee. Actually let'stake a coffee break for the url.  <br>00:08:23.000 We'll put in network chuck.coffee.And here's where the keyword comes in.  <br>00:08:26.560 Let's go out there real quick.  <br>00:08:27.320 Let's find a word or a phrasethat comes up when the page loads.  <br>00:08:29.880 Like right here it says start brewing.  <br>00:08:31.280 Let's take that case sensitiveand put it right here.  <br>00:08:33.400 What it will actually do is attempt toload the webpage and it will search for  <br>00:08:38.360 that keyword to make sure you'reactually loading the actual page.  <br>00:08:41.159 And if it loads the keyword, you'reup. If it doesn't, you're down.  <br>00:08:44.350 That's powerful. So I'll change thatto 30 seconds. Click on save and cool,  <br>00:08:48.600 we're up. Now, if I were to change itto something that's not on the site,  <br>00:08:51.360 if I were to edit, if I were to changeit to Ron Swanson and click save,  <br>00:08:55.680 it's gonna say it's down. And noticeit's telling me it's all degraded.  <br>00:08:58.400 It's scary and red. IfI go to my dashboard,  <br>00:09:00.840 which is right up here at the top right,  <br>00:09:02.240 it'll show me what's up and what's down.And notice it even does tell me that,  <br>00:09:05.880 hey, it's 200. Okay, but we couldn'tfind that keyword. So that's, ugh,  <br>00:09:09.520 that's so cool. Now what do you say?We speed around a few more monitors.  <br>00:09:12.440 Things you'll definitely want for yourhome lab or your business or whatever  <br>00:09:15.280 you're doing. Let's click on addnew monitor. Choose our type.  <br>00:09:18.100 Now I want to make sure ad guardis up. So I'm gonna do dns.  <br>00:09:21.000 I'll put in the host name. I want itto resolve, just say network [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/).  <br>00:09:24.190 I'll put in my A guard server as theresolver 4 53. That's what I'm using.  <br>00:09:28.340 And just change some heartbeat intervals.And that's it. Click on save. Wait,  <br>00:09:32.280 why is this thing refused make look what happened? Um, oh,  <br>00:09:35.880 why did I go to port51? Did I change that?  <br>00:09:37.760 I guess I must have you done my scrollthing. All right. Okay, we're up.  <br>00:09:41.240 That scare me for a second.Live troubleshooting. Andlook how cool this is.  <br>00:09:44.520 If you jump into thatmonitor for agar here,  <br>00:09:46.120 it will show me the resultsit's receiving. That's supercool. Now ping monitor,  <br>00:09:49.520 it's pretty straightforward. It'sgoing to send an ICMP message. Hey,  <br>00:09:52.880 are you awake? And itresponds, yes I am. If it is,  <br>00:09:55.680 you can pretty much monitoranything with that one.  <br>00:09:57.760 But this one right here ispretty powerful. The TCP port,  <br>00:10:00.360 you can specify a specific TCPport to monitor. So for example,  <br>00:10:04.040 I've got a Plex server in mynetwork, I wanna see if it's up.  <br>00:10:06.600 That's my host name. And PL bydefault, beyond port 32,400,  <br>00:10:11.240 check the every 30 seconds saveand bam. I know if Plex is up now,  <br>00:10:15.440 if I were to go in there and just stopthe service, we'll see what happens.  <br>00:10:18.000 Stopping it now it is stoppedand boom, it's down. It tells me,  <br>00:10:22.320 and I love that. Now let's get it backup. Boom. Okay, we're back up. Whew.  <br>00:10:25.810 So I think you got the monitoringpart right? It'll monitor your stuff,  <br>00:10:28.200 it'll tell you when stuff isdown or up. It's beautiful.  <br>00:10:30.520 But is it actually telling you,  <br>00:10:31.640 cuz you're not gonna sit here andlook at your dashboard all day,  <br>00:10:33.960 although you could, it'sawesome. It's mesmerizing.  <br>00:10:36.220 But you wanted to tell you when you'reout and about a quick discord or Slack  <br>00:10:39.520 message, telegram. It'll do allthose things. What do you say?  <br>00:10:42.040 We set up Slack right [now.So](http://now.so/) up here at the top, right,  <br>00:10:44.120 we'll go to your name kind of thingup there and click on settings.  <br>00:10:48.200 Well actually while I'm here you canchange all kinds of stuff like appearance,  <br>00:10:51.230 dark mode. You always wannabe in dark mode. You just do.  <br>00:10:53.680 You can set up a reverse proxy, notgonna cover that here, but maybe later.  <br>00:10:56.880 And then a nice added feature thathe didn't have to do but he did.  <br>00:10:59.760 Under security, you can set up twofactor what? I love that. But anyways,  <br>00:11:04.080 what we care about rightnow is notifications.  <br>00:11:05.600 Click on notifications and let's setup one click on set up notification.  <br>00:11:09.100 Let me show you all the options youhave. It's stupid. Look at this. What?  <br>00:11:12.990 Pretty much everything. Now again, whatI care about right now is not email.  <br>00:11:17.040 You can do email though. That'spretty cool. Uh, slack, I'll name it.  <br>00:11:20.200 And then here we'll need a web hook url,  <br>00:11:22.240 which is the URL that Uptime Kuma willuse to send a message to saying, Hey,  <br>00:11:26.400 your pluck servers down,we'll send it to that url.  <br>00:11:28.720 Slack will take it from there. A web hookis actually pretty similar to an api.  <br>00:11:31.960 It's just sitting there open, ready togo waiting to receive a message from you.  <br>00:11:35.280 Now for Slack to do this, you'llneed to set up an application.  <br>00:11:38.000 I'm not gonna cover the details of that,but they have a linked right down here.  <br>00:11:40.960 Click on that. Set up an app realquick. I'll start from scratch.  <br>00:11:44.200 I'm gonna add an incomingweb hook, turn it on,  <br>00:11:46.820 add a new web hook to the workspace.I'll choose the general channel for now.  <br>00:11:50.360 And then right here is that web hookurl. URL generator for me. I'll make it,  <br>00:11:53.000 make it a bit bigger to seeright here. I'm gonna copy that,  <br>00:11:55.920 paste that into my web hook url. Also, Igotta make sure I install that app. Oh,  <br>00:11:59.990 I already did. Okay, we're good. I'llput a username. Just call it uptime Kuma.  <br>00:12:03.400 You can do an icon emoji. I'll dothe fire one. Everything's on fire.  <br>00:12:06.770 Is emojipedia down. Theyneed some uptime coma.  <br>00:12:09.270 I don't need channel name because theweb hook is already setting that up for  <br>00:12:12.160 me. And that's pretty much it.  <br>00:12:14.020 I'm gonna test it real quick sincesuccessfully make I Slack. Yep,  <br>00:12:17.800 slack alert testing right there.  <br>00:12:19.200 And what's cool is I can apply this toall existing monitors and make it default  <br>00:12:22.200 enabled. Click on safe, good to go. Sonow if I were to stop plex again, ah,  <br>00:12:26.320 there it goes. Plex is down and there'smy Slack message. Bam, there it is.  <br>00:12:31.200 That's cool, right? Like that's sopowerful. How easy was that to do?  <br>00:12:34.790 I can't tell you how lucky we are rightnow in this day and age to have this  <br>00:12:38.480 setting up monitoring has never beeneasier and it was so hard back in the day.  <br>00:12:41.920 Not at the risk of making thisvideo way too long. .  <br>00:12:44.280 There is one more thing I wanna showyou cuz this thing's action Pat. Dude,  <br>00:12:47.880 come on. My video editor hates, hates memaking my videos too long. Eat it Nick.  <br>00:12:51.080 I don't care. Up here we havea thing called status pages.  <br>00:12:55.050 Oh I love this app is socool. They click on that.  <br>00:12:57.600 I can create a status page that I canmake available to anybody so people can  <br>00:13:01.760 monitor and tell me if my things are up.  <br>00:13:03.280 I can set it up as a dashboardon my TV or an iPad or something.  <br>00:13:06.520 So I click on ad new status page.I can name it, give it a url,  <br>00:13:10.120 slug and it up chuck, click on next.  <br>00:13:12.580 And then you just kind of make itlook pretty. You can add monitors,  <br>00:13:16.160 I'll add my network check website andyou can add all your stuff and click on  <br>00:13:20.000 save. And there it is a reallybeautiful, I mean it's kind of beautiful.  <br>00:13:23.130 We gotta make a dark mode. Ugh, therewe go. Now it's beautiful status page.  <br>00:13:27.320 You can go up here and say, we have anincident. Yo stuff is down. We know.  <br>00:13:31.810 So people can see stuff is down and theyknow that. You know, powerful stuff.  <br>00:13:34.960 Again, a tool I cannotbelieve is free and a tool.  <br>00:13:38.400 I can't believe you're notalready using. Are you using it?  <br>00:13:40.320 Like you should have gone throughthis and set it up with me.  <br>00:13:42.000 Have you not done thatyet? Do it right now.  <br>00:13:43.400 Thank you for spending time with me toset up some uptime. Kua is your stuff up?  <br>00:13:46.400 I don't know. Coffee. Bye.

You need to deploy it.  <br>00:00:03.360 Not only is it free and open source,which I don't know how that's possible,  <br>00:00:06.570 but you're gonna learn so much abouthacking and security while also protecting  <br>00:00:10.500 your stuff. It's a no-brainer.  <br>00:00:11.760 I deployed the server in about fiveminutes and then deployed agents to all of  <br>00:00:15.066 my computers and servers,Mac, windows, Lennox.  <br>00:00:17.670 Now these agents are like the tattletalesin school. They tell me everything.  <br>00:00:21.270 Things like security configurationare all my devices misconfigured?  <br>00:00:24.240 I don't know, but I do Now it'll checkfor known vulnerabilities, malware,  <br>00:00:27.660 and then this is kind of nuts.  <br>00:00:28.950 It can track a directory and see if anychanges occurred, files added removed,  <br>00:00:33.090 documents edited, andthis is even crazier.  <br>00:00:35.100 It can track the changes to theWindows registry. Are you kidding me?  <br>00:00:38.130 It's amazing.  <br>00:00:38.820 So all these devices send all theinformation to my server and I can see  <br>00:00:42.030 everything from onelocation. I get alerts,  <br>00:00:44.430 which can come at me viaemail or Slack or whatever.  <br>00:00:46.800 I can do things in response tothose alerts. Active response.  <br>00:00:49.775 So not only can I detect a brute forceattack, I can do something about it.  <br>00:00:53.490 Block that IP, address. Thisserver or this tool is called waza.  <br>00:00:56.910 It's a type of cybersecuritytool called asim,  <br>00:00:59.190 security Information and Event Management.But I so badly wanna call it a siem.  <br>00:01:03.360 I'm gonna call it a siem. I don't care.  <br>00:01:04.800 This type of tool is what the blue teamor defensive side of cybersecurity will  <br>00:01:08.340 use to defend against the bad guys tostop the hackers. So on this video,  <br>00:01:11.910 I'm gonna show you how to deploy thiscuz you need to. It's amazing. Again,  <br>00:01:15.390 not only will you beprotecting your stuff,  <br>00:01:17.340 but you're gonna learn so much and it'salso kind of addicting. And seriously,  <br>00:01:21.210 this is something you could probably puton your resume. This is a project like,  <br>00:01:24.060 hey, I run my own seam,sim seam seam seams.  <br>00:01:28.740 Pretty cool, doesn't it? ,I That was lame. I'm sorry.  <br>00:01:31.830 So you're convinced, let's talk aboutwhat you need. Really only two things.  <br>00:01:34.740 A Linux server or computer and somethingto monitor. So other computers,  <br>00:01:39.570 most flavors of Lennox are supported.I'll be installing it on Ubuntu.  <br>00:01:42.840 And more specifically, I'll be on a cloudmachine in ano. That's what I prefer.  <br>00:01:46.860 So I can monitor everything withease and also it's ridiculously easy.  <br>00:01:50.520 I'll walk you through it here ina bit. But it can also be on-prem,  <br>00:01:53.010 on a server you already have. Orit can be on a Docker container.  <br>00:01:55.770 Lemme get some room here, alreadygot a room, scoot down. There we go.  <br>00:01:58.680 And they even have an ova foreasy deployment on virtual box.  <br>00:02:01.740 Now as far as systemrequirements for the Wza server,  <br>00:02:04.290 lemme show you what theyrecommend. At minimum,  <br>00:02:06.120 they want two gigs of RAM and two CPUcores. That'll work for most people.  <br>00:02:10.080 If you got a lot of devices, if you'regonna be collecting lots of logs,  <br>00:02:12.395 you wanna go larger. Four gigs ofRam and eight CPU cores. Now again,  <br>00:02:16.320 I'm gonna walk you through the cloudoption and then also sprinkle in a little  <br>00:02:19.110 bit of dog or two just for fun. Oh,almost forgot the most important thing.  <br>00:02:22.260 Coffee. Everything in it requirescoffee. It's just the rules.  <br>00:02:27.900 Network.  <br>00:02:28.110 Chuck.coffee first. All we'll setup. Waza or wsu, I'm not sure.  <br>00:02:31.230 I'm just gonna call it waza in the cloud.  <br>00:02:33.065 So let's head on over to [od.com/networkchuck](http://od.com/networkchuck) or check the link below.  <br>00:02:37.350 Now not only is LY nodethe sponsor of this video,  <br>00:02:39.540 but they are my favorite cloud provider.Like I'm not lying, check this up.  <br>00:02:42.450 I have way too many virtual machines inthe cloud because I just go in here and  <br>00:02:46.050 spin up something.Anytime I have a project,  <br>00:02:47.940 anytime I wanna mess withsomething, I just go to LE Node,  <br>00:02:50.460 spin up a quick virtual machine inseconds. Now if you're new to LE Node,  <br>00:02:53.760 this is gonna be free foryou. For the first 60 days,  <br>00:02:56.010 they're gonna give you $100 creditto go crazy and play around with it.  <br>00:02:59.140 So if you haven't already,  <br>00:02:59.920 go ahead and get signed up right nowand then get signed in and meet me back  <br>00:03:02.950 here.  <br>00:03:03.280 Now the other reason I love Le Node isthey make deploying virtual machines like  <br>00:03:06.130 waza. Super stinking easy. Check thisout. I'm gonna go to create Lin node.  <br>00:03:09.730 I'll click on Marketplace and thenI'll search for waza. There it is.  <br>00:03:13.390 Let's go and click on that and justhave it selected and we'll scroll down a  <br>00:03:16.215 bit.  <br>00:03:16.420 Now time for just a little bit of configFirst put an email address then for the  <br>00:03:19.810 SSL certificate. Then a limitedpseudo user account, Bernard hack.  <br>00:03:23.410 Well this can beanything. Just make it up.  <br>00:03:24.940 Put a password in and we'll scrolldown just a little bit until we see.  <br>00:03:28.600 Select an image. We'reusing Ubuntu Perfect region.  <br>00:03:31.450 Select somewhere close toyou. Leno is a cloud provider.  <br>00:03:33.430 So they have data centers everywhere.  <br>00:03:35.080 Pick somewhere close to you so it'llbe nice and fast. I'm in Dallas.  <br>00:03:37.960 And finally our LE node plan. Fromhere, let's click on share. At cpu,  <br>00:03:41.080 they're cheaper. And here we have ourplans or the size of our virtual machine.  <br>00:03:44.440 Now normally I would pick this oneright here. It's five bucks a month,  <br>00:03:47.320 super cheap. But for waza, you wantsomething a bit beefier, a bit bigger,  <br>00:03:51.010 something more like theLE node, four gigabyte.  <br>00:03:52.870 Now if you don't select the four gigabyteoption for this WASA installation,  <br>00:03:56.380 it just won't work. I tried [it.So](http://it.so/) just make sure you select this.  <br>00:03:59.530 Now if you do wanna go for a smalleroption, like the LE node, two gigabyte,  <br>00:04:02.470 I actually got that working withDocker and it worked pretty well.  <br>00:04:05.170 I'll walk you through that here in asecond. Well, let's go ahead and do this.  <br>00:04:07.390 It's really not much more. It'sso easy. So select four gigabyte.  <br>00:04:10.330 Scroll down just a bit, labelthis sucker, whatever you want.  <br>00:04:14.140 Enter a root password.  <br>00:04:15.280 And finally we'll scroll down and clickon create LE node at the bottom right.  <br>00:04:18.790 Ready, set, go. Nowit's gonna do its thing.  <br>00:04:21.250 It's gonna bake you a VM inthe cloud. Quick coffee break,  <br>00:04:26.410 it'll be a few minutes. And once yousee that your LE node is running,  <br>00:04:29.830 we can try and connect to it. Overhere we have our SSH access command.  <br>00:04:32.980 We're gonna go ahead and copy thisright here and then launch your terminal  <br>00:04:35.770 Windows, Mac and Linux. It'll allwork. And paste that in there. Enter,  <br>00:04:39.340 accept all fingerprints. Putyour password in and we're in.  <br>00:04:42.550 But it may not be quite ready. Waza isstill going through its installation.  <br>00:04:46.060 We can monitor it kind of rightnow by typing in H top H T O P.  <br>00:04:50.530 And we'll see right at the top there,the top process. D P K G or D package.  <br>00:04:55.000 That's how apps on Linux are installedand that's what's happening right now.  <br>00:04:58.240 So we can kinda sit there andwatch that until that stops.  <br>00:05:00.645 And we can try to connect herein a moment and like see here,  <br>00:05:02.470 we have some wza stuff there. TheWZA index year is being installed.  <br>00:05:05.770 There's a bunch of pieces toit. It's amazing. But again,  <br>00:05:07.780 quick coffee break andwatch the magic happen.  <br>00:05:11.020 Now at this point it's been aboutsix minutes. Let's see if it's done.  <br>00:05:13.930 And we'll start with grabbingour password. By the way,  <br>00:05:16.090 I hit control C to get out of that,  <br>00:05:17.560 if we type in LS dash aland our terminal here,  <br>00:05:20.590 we should see a dot deploymentdash secrets dot txc file.  <br>00:05:24.670 There it has our secrets or ourpasswords. Let's go ahead and cap that.  <br>00:05:27.430 Cats dot deployment secrets,blah blah. Got it. Bam.  <br>00:05:30.280 There's our passwords right there.  <br>00:05:31.360 The first one we want is theadmin password at the top.  <br>00:05:33.580 Got our admin username and our adminpassword. Cool, keep that there.  <br>00:05:36.880 Let's go back to ourLE node dashboard here.  <br>00:05:38.650 And we're gonna grab our LE node reverseDNS name or R D N S. So here Leno node.  <br>00:05:42.880 Click on the network tab.  <br>00:05:44.170 Scroll down just a little bit untilwe see the IP addresses section.  <br>00:05:47.830 And then we have the reverse DNS righthere. There it is. Just go and grab that,  <br>00:05:51.850 copy it.  <br>00:05:52.600 Open a new tab and go to https colonwhack whack paste that in .  <br>00:05:57.650 Here we go. It's there. Now let's getlogged in. Use your name admin password.  <br>00:06:01.700 Let's grab that from the terminalthere. It's copy and paste.  <br>00:06:05.870 It's gonna check and make sure thingsare good. Almost there or good. Awesome.  <br>00:06:09.560 This seems pretty cool. Last timeI'll do that joke. Probably not.  <br>00:06:13.310 Seems like a ock. Sorry .It's terrible. Now before we move on,  <br>00:06:17.180 I'm gonna show the dockerinstall. It's super easy.  <br>00:06:19.910 If you don't care about that,that's fine. Just skip ahead.  <br>00:06:22.015 I've got timestamps below. Nowhere's the docker install. Perfect.  <br>00:06:24.800 Four on-prem or a smaller machine on LEnode, which is what I'll be doing here.  <br>00:06:28.790 Leno. I'm gonna click on create le node.  <br>00:06:30.620 I'll just deploy a standardUbuntu 2204 lts machine,  <br>00:06:35.300 shared cpu. I know that the LEnode, two gigabyte plan will work.  <br>00:06:38.990 I tried it on the one gig, the containersjust wouldn't run. Don't try it.  <br>00:06:42.260 But the two gig plan, it worked [great.So](http://great.so/) click that, label it something fun,  <br>00:06:45.560 put a password in and then click oncreate le node. How fast was that?  <br>00:06:49.340 Now if you're doing this on-prem,  <br>00:06:50.450 just have a server that's running Dockerand of course if you want to run the  <br>00:06:53.600 ova, I'll put a link below and wassdocumentation. After a moment or two,  <br>00:06:57.140 you should see that your machine isrunning. Let's go and connect to it.  <br>00:07:00.110 We'll grab our SSH access command overhere. Just copy that. Launch my terminal,  <br>00:07:03.830 paste it, head enter, accept allfingerprints, password. And we're in.  <br>00:07:07.730 Couple things we'll do real quick.First we'll update our repositories.  <br>00:07:10.250 Pseudo a P t update. Now many of you'regonna go, why is he doing pseudo?  <br>00:07:13.730 You're route. I always do pseudocause I don't know what you're using.  <br>00:07:17.330 You may not be root right now. I justwanna make it simple. Anyways, I digress.  <br>00:07:21.650 Pseudo PT update to update ourrepositories. Once that finishes up,  <br>00:07:24.830 we'll do a pseudo PT andinstall [docker.io](http://docker.io/) and docker  <br>00:07:29.630 dash compose. We'll doa dash y at the end.  <br>00:07:32.420 This is going to install dockerand Docker compose. So let's go.  <br>00:07:35.420 Should be fairly quick. More of a coffeesip here. Awesome, it is finished.  <br>00:07:39.650 The next step, I've got a link below.  <br>00:07:41.120 Go ahead and pull up the Wazadocumentation for a docker deployment.  <br>00:07:44.480 Well one two punch this real quick.  <br>00:07:45.800 First we'll clone the get repositoryone command. Let's copy that.  <br>00:07:49.100 Go back to your terminal, paste thatcommand assuming you have get installed.  <br>00:07:52.130 Most oss do clone. Awesome type in Ls.  <br>00:07:54.710 We'll see a new directorycalled waza Docker.  <br>00:07:56.960 Let's go ahead and CD into that cd,waza, Docker type in LS once more.  <br>00:08:01.280 And we have one moredirectory we wanna jump into.  <br>00:08:03.650 It's the single node directory becausewe're deploying one single node or  <br>00:08:07.250 computer cd single node. Perfect.  <br>00:08:10.520 Now the next thing we'll have to do isgenerate some self sign certificates.  <br>00:08:13.880 They make that super easy for us.  <br>00:08:15.145 They even have a Docker composefile to run and do that for us.  <br>00:08:18.080 And all we have to do iscopy and paste this command.  <br>00:08:19.820 So copy this command right here,paste that in there, hit enter.  <br>00:08:23.810 It's gonna pull those images down.Run, compose. And then that was it.  <br>00:08:27.410 That's done. Now for our next step,  <br>00:08:28.880 all we have to do is do thedocker dash compose command  <br>00:08:33.740 with the up option. And then we'll do adash D to launch it in the background.  <br>00:08:37.730 This will do everything for us. Thisis our last step in deploying this.  <br>00:08:40.700 It's super easy. I love docker. Ready,set, go. This will take a moment.  <br>00:08:45.320 It's deploying a multi-tierapplication, pulling all the images,  <br>00:08:48.740 a lot of stuff going on. Little coffeebreak. We'll give it some time here.  <br>00:08:51.740 Okay, deployment is done, done, done.  <br>00:08:54.110 Let's confirm real quickby typing in docker stats.  <br>00:08:57.780 Get a realtime view of those suckersrunning. Let's go get logged in.  <br>00:09:00.930 Let's check it out. We'll getback to our Leno dashboard here.  <br>00:09:03.360 Go to the network tab. Scrolldown just a little bit,  <br>00:09:05.640 find our reverse DNS name righthere in the IP addresses section.  <br>00:09:09.690 Go ahead and copy that and we'llopen up a new tab. Type in https,  <br>00:09:13.200 colon whack whack, paste that inthere. Let's go. Fingers crossed. Okay,  <br>00:09:16.800 this is a self-signed cert. We'll getthis little error message. No big deal.  <br>00:09:19.710 Should proceed. Was that sorry. Um,this video has so many lame jokes.  <br>00:09:23.460 Let's get logged in. Default. Login willbe admin password will be according to.  <br>00:09:27.660 Was it documentation? Whatwas it? Was it ? Sorry.  <br>00:09:32.400 Sorry, not sorry. Oh, it's uh, secretpassword. Capital S. Capital P.  <br>00:09:36.360 Easy enough. Just gotta check and makesure things are good. Almost. Okay,  <br>00:09:40.200 things are good. Now thatwe have, was it installed?  <br>00:09:42.720 Let's get some agents added.Computers that we can monitor.  <br>00:09:45.150 So right here we'll click on addagent right here in the dashboard.  <br>00:09:48.330 And then right here we'll havethe option to deploy a new agent.  <br>00:09:51.330 Go ahead and click on that. Thisis super straightforward and easy.  <br>00:09:53.760 We'll start with theLinux host first. Again,  <br>00:09:55.410 I'm gonna do Ubuntu and we'll doa Windows after this. By the way,  <br>00:09:57.990 Ubuntu 15 or more architecture is X 86.  <br>00:10:01.170 But notice we have optionsfor everything. It's awesome.  <br>00:10:03.690 Then we'll put our was aserver address in here.  <br>00:10:05.520 This will simply be your LE node,  <br>00:10:06.930 reverse DNS name if you did it withme or it could be an IP address.  <br>00:10:09.480 Just something that the agent can haveaccess to. So I'll copy that server.  <br>00:10:12.660 Address the F Q D N fully qualifieddomain name just like this.  <br>00:10:16.770 I will name that agent. It's optionalbut I like to Callie underscore Linux.  <br>00:10:21.300 We'll select a group. I'llput it in the default group.  <br>00:10:23.460 And then on step six they give you onecommand to install the agent. Super cool.  <br>00:10:27.180 Super easy. Let's copy that. Copy command.  <br>00:10:29.190 And then here in Cali I'll launch myterminal. Paste that command head,  <br>00:10:32.340 enter pseudo password and it's done.Cool. One more thing we have to do,  <br>00:10:37.260 getting back to the was a dashboard.We need to enable this as a service.  <br>00:10:40.385 We'll just copy this. Commandall system, CTL commands,  <br>00:10:42.870 paste those commands in there,head enter and done. Awesome.  <br>00:10:46.410 So now getting back to the WASA dashboard.  <br>00:10:48.270 We can go to the top left here onthis drop down and click on agents.  <br>00:10:51.390 There it is right there. My first littleguy, Callie Lennox, his IP address os.  <br>00:10:56.310 And it's gonna show us so much more.Oh, I can't wait to show you this,  <br>00:10:59.135 but first, before we do that,let's add Windows real quick.  <br>00:11:01.260 But notice how fast and easy thisis and Windows. It's just as easy.  <br>00:11:04.020 Let's go ahead and douh, deploy new agent.  <br>00:11:06.000 Once more this time we'llclick on Windows. Goodness,  <br>00:11:08.790 they still have WindowsXP in here. .  <br>00:11:11.280 I guess you need a scenefor this man. But anyways,  <br>00:11:13.500 I'm on Windows seven or more orgreater. No Windows arm support, sad,  <br>00:11:16.950 fully qualified domain name would be oursame. I uh, domain name or IP address.  <br>00:11:20.700 Again, just something your agent can haveaccess to. I'll name it default group.  <br>00:11:24.330 And finally at step six, just like Linux,  <br>00:11:26.430 we're gonna have our littleone-liner command using PowerShell.  <br>00:11:29.280 Keeping in mind you will need to runthis as administrator cause you will need  <br>00:11:32.580 admin privileges. So I'lljust copy that command,  <br>00:11:34.680 jump into my Windows computer here.  <br>00:11:36.870 So here in Windows I'lllaunch my Windows terminal.  <br>00:11:38.850 Keeping in mind I'll haveto launch it as admin.  <br>00:11:40.740 So right click this and click on run asadministrator. Pace my command in there,  <br>00:11:44.430 hit enter. Gonna do its thing.And then one more command.  <br>00:11:47.010 We'll have to start theservice here on Windows.  <br>00:11:48.990 Just like Linux net start was a SVCwas a is starting and we're off to the  <br>00:11:53.410 races. Let's go check Waza, the Wazadashboard. We'll go to our agents.  <br>00:11:56.710 Oh there it is. It's still coming up.  <br>00:11:58.330 Let's click on refresh over here onthe right. Refresh, refresh, refresh.  <br>00:12:01.420 Come on. Connect. I'm impatient.And after a billion refreshes. No,  <br>00:12:04.240 I'm just kidding. It was likethree. Um, it's up. Awesome.  <br>00:12:07.120 And here's our two machines at Lennoxand Windows. And you know what,  <br>00:12:10.540 I wanna add one morejust for fun. Ready Go.  <br>00:12:14.050 It was seriously actuallyalmost that fast.  <br>00:12:16.090 So here we have our agents and now let'sclick on one of these and see what's  <br>00:12:19.150 going on. This is gonna be [fun.So](http://fun.so/) I'm gonna click on the new one.  <br>00:12:21.280 I just added the Circs network. Chuck,that's from my CIRCS search video.  <br>00:12:25.780 It's a public box and it'sgonna be kind of fun to look at.  <br>00:12:28.065 It's click on that guy. And here's ouragent dashboard for this one computer,  <br>00:12:31.360 this one server. There's a lot going on.  <br>00:12:33.100 But just keep in mindat the top here in Waza,  <br>00:12:34.720 we kind of have breadcrumbsand I love this.  <br>00:12:36.520 We've got agents and we're drilled downinto the specific agent we're looking  <br>00:12:39.645 at. And then here at thedashboard, so much going on.  <br>00:12:42.430 Now I'm not gonna show youeverything. There's way too much,  <br>00:12:44.530 way too much fun to be had.  <br>00:12:45.705 But I will point out a fewthings that are like kind of wow.  <br>00:12:48.250 First the Mitre framework.The Mitre attack framework.  <br>00:12:51.340 We won't go too deep into this,  <br>00:12:52.510 but just know it's a database of hackingtechniques that hackers will use to  <br>00:12:55.720 attack machines. This will look atthat framework and tell you, Hey,  <br>00:12:59.710 your machine might be vulnerable to this,  <br>00:13:01.840 these tactics or your machine isactively being attacked in these ways.  <br>00:13:06.190 And notice, um, some thingsare happening to mine.  <br>00:13:08.470 We'll take a look at those here ina bit. And then quick drive by here.  <br>00:13:11.350 Compliance. Many companies have to obeycertain compliance standards like pci,  <br>00:13:15.145 gdpr, nist, hipaa. This willcheck all your computers,  <br>00:13:18.580 all your servers and tell you what'sgoing on. That's kind of crazy. Now,  <br>00:13:22.270 you may not care about policies. Youshould if you wanna get into security,  <br>00:13:25.000 but it may not be important foryou right now. Scroll down a bit.  <br>00:13:27.100 What about configuration? Is your serveror your computer configured securely?  <br>00:13:30.490 Do you know that for a fact?Well this will tell you .  <br>00:13:33.070 It has a module called SCAor secure configuration.  <br>00:13:36.370 I think it's audit or assessment,secure configuration assessment.  <br>00:13:39.610 And it will pull out a C I S assessment.  <br>00:13:42.040 This is for buntu Linux andtell you how good you are. Um,  <br>00:13:44.770 39% on my score failed 715 of these.  <br>00:13:48.040 Now let me give you like kind ofa baseline for what that means.  <br>00:13:50.020 Let's jump into this report.Notice here in the breadcrumbs,  <br>00:13:52.000 I did jump into the security configurationassessment section and it'll tell me  <br>00:13:55.480 all the things I failed at. Let meactually sort by. Uh, good stuff.  <br>00:13:58.750 It's gonna be a small list. Andmost of this is like default.  <br>00:14:00.970 So like App Armor is installed cool,  <br>00:14:03.010 but it'll go deeper and tell you thingslike hey you should disable USB storage.  <br>00:14:05.860 If that drill down to SSH cuz you cansearch for specific things like that.  <br>00:14:08.740 Keyword . It'll tell me thingslike, hey don't install Telenet.  <br>00:14:11.860 U F W is not enabled.Disable ssh sh root login.  <br>00:14:14.920 So not only is it showingyou like hey you're insecure,  <br>00:14:17.080 but it's also teaching you. Causeif I click on any one of these,  <br>00:14:19.420 it'll tell me like, Heyhere's the rationale, here'swhy we're telling you this.  <br>00:14:22.360 Here's how you fix it,here's how you check it.  <br>00:14:24.520 And then it shows you all the miretechniques that can be used against having  <br>00:14:27.765 that misconfiguration. That's sofreaking powerful. Are you kidding me?  <br>00:14:31.270 It's okay, I'm getting a littleexcited coffee, you'll calm me down.  <br>00:14:35.440 That's just one module speed mode. Let'sget back to our agent dashboard here.  <br>00:14:38.890 Here on the menu we have security eventsshowing you things like authentication  <br>00:14:41.800 failures, which could be brute forceattacks. It'll show you top five alerts.  <br>00:14:45.280 It'll give you a list ofsecurity alerts. Super powerful.  <br>00:14:47.890 And then here's something you're notgonna see right away. If I click on more,  <br>00:14:50.770 we have vulnerabilities.  <br>00:14:52.580 It'll check your system forvulnerabilities but it'snot enabled by default.  <br>00:14:55.400 I'll show you how to dothis here in a moment.  <br>00:14:57.230 But I have another system I alreadyhad up and running and if I look at  <br>00:14:59.870 vulnerabilities for that one,  <br>00:15:01.490 it's gonna check all myapplications and tell me like, Hey,  <br>00:15:04.310 are there known CBEs out thereor common vulnerabilities?  <br>00:15:07.640 And I've got a bunch likea lot. But just look at this,  <br>00:15:11.300 deploy this for your house or yourservers or whatever you have and play  <br>00:15:14.390 security admin. Go in here and go,oh wow, I've got 170 critical CDEs.  <br>00:15:18.680 I should go figure out how to fixthose. The learning opportunity.  <br>00:15:21.740 Are you kidding me? And then hereon my server I already had going.  <br>00:15:24.260 I do wanna show you one thing here on oneof my Windows hosts or Windows agents.  <br>00:15:28.400 This is kind of fun. I have my daughter'scomputer here, this is amazing.  <br>00:15:31.010 Check this out. I'll click on Chloe.  <br>00:15:32.720 And the one thing you're gonna loveabout Windows Host is the integrity  <br>00:15:36.170 monitoring module. Oh my gosh,thing's amazing. Check it out.  <br>00:15:39.830 The sucker's gonna monitor all theimportant files and registry keys that are  <br>00:15:44.360 normally modified whensomething's being hacked.  <br>00:15:46.400 It's gonna look at things and tellyou when things are being adjusted.  <br>00:15:48.830 So like check this out. If I go to events,  <br>00:15:50.570 it'll tell me each time aregister key is changed.  <br>00:15:52.550 Like this one was deleted firewallpolicy. I don't know why that happened.  <br>00:15:55.640 Now some of these are automatic,like the Windows OS is doing it,  <br>00:15:58.370 but others can be bad. It's gotta crazy.  <br>00:16:01.580 And it's not just registry keys.If I go to inventory over here,  <br>00:16:03.950 I can see that it hasinventory of the files,  <br>00:16:05.390 it's monitoring and all the registry keys,  <br>00:16:07.190 it's monitoring and what they'recurrently set to. Is it not insane?  <br>00:16:09.890 And here in a moment I'llshow you how you can s uh,  <br>00:16:11.575 monitor specific keys and get alerts onthose keys and files too. It's so fun.  <br>00:16:15.950 Now at this point your seamseems to be doing great. I lied,  <br>00:16:19.220 I was gonna do it one more [time.It](http://time.it/) seems to be doing pretty good.  <br>00:16:21.260 Pretty much all youhave to do is set it up,  <br>00:16:23.060 connect an agent to it and it collectsinformation and you can go crazy and  <br>00:16:26.750 learn cybersecurity andstart to protect your stuff.  <br>00:16:29.660 But you can also tinker with this quitea bit. You can enable more modules,  <br>00:16:32.690 set up more alerts, monitor morethings. So if you're interested in that,  <br>00:16:35.815 we're gonna walk througha few more options here.  <br>00:16:37.910 Now the first thing we'll do is lookat file monitoring through Windows.  <br>00:16:41.120 It's so powerful and so cool. Soback here at the WASA incense,  <br>00:16:44.810 I deployed with youright now in this video.  <br>00:16:46.700 Couple things real quick justbefore we jump into that.  <br>00:16:48.530 If I click on the home icon,  <br>00:16:49.610 it's gonna take me to the WASA dashboardand it's gonna show me like all the  <br>00:16:52.040 modules I could jump into. So for example,if I wanna jump into security events,  <br>00:16:55.340 it's gonna show me security events.  <br>00:16:56.480 But right now it's beingfiltered to look at one agent.  <br>00:16:59.030 I can unpin that to where it's showingme everything from every agent.  <br>00:17:02.270 That's pretty cool. And you can do thatwith most modules. Let's go back home.  <br>00:17:05.060 Now let's click on Waza oncemore. Will Waza drop down here?  <br>00:17:08.030 Let's click on agents. Now again,I'm not going over everything.  <br>00:17:10.940 Every little thing you can do and youdon't have to know all these things,  <br>00:17:13.520 but you can play aroundwith it. You can go crazy.  <br>00:17:16.310 I'm just giving you enough to getstarted and have a little bit of fun and  <br>00:17:18.710 things I got really excited [about.So](http://about.so/) let's click on agents here.  <br>00:17:21.170 We'll click on my Windows machine.  <br>00:17:22.640 A couple things I'm gonnashow you real quick.  <br>00:17:23.960 If I click on Integrity Monitoring,  <br>00:17:25.339 this is the module thatwe'll use to monitor files.  <br>00:17:28.160 Notice I don't have any events right now.  <br>00:17:29.540 I've got it filtered right now by thelast 24 hours and I've just connected this  <br>00:17:32.900 thing, nothing's happened.But if I go to the inventory,  <br>00:17:35.240 I can see that it already has scannedand inventoried all the default files.  <br>00:17:39.260 It'll look for in thedirectories. And my registry keys.  <br>00:17:41.600 I believe it's set to scaneverything every 12 hours.  <br>00:17:45.020 And if it notices a change, it'll letyou know. It'll alert you. Pretty cool.  <br>00:17:47.870 But with files we can also do realtime notification and rule set.  <br>00:17:51.450 Check this out.  <br>00:17:52.290 I'm gonna jump into my Windows host andchange some configuration for the agent  <br>00:17:55.830 file. Now you can find that here.I'm gonna go to my Windows Explorer,  <br>00:17:58.530 go to my C Drive, goto program files X 86.  <br>00:18:01.440 Now if this is all like weird foryou, like oh man Windows file system,  <br>00:18:03.990 I don't know what's going on.  <br>00:18:05.190 I do detail a lot of what this meansand how it's organized in my Windows  <br>00:18:08.910 Fundamentals course on my academy.Check it out, link below. Anyways,  <br>00:18:12.120 let's continue. It's an X 86 andin a folder called OS sec Agent,  <br>00:18:16.920 jump in there. Continue.You gotta have admin access.  <br>00:18:19.680 If I scroll down just a bit,I'll see a file named os [sec.com](http://sec.com/).  <br>00:18:23.430 That's your configurationfile for your agent.  <br>00:18:25.320 Let's go to open that with notepad.Open with notepad. Oh, by the way,  <br>00:18:28.920 you can do the same thing on Linux.I'll put documentation below.  <br>00:18:31.980 It's pretty much the same process, justediting the same type of agent file.  <br>00:18:35.430 But let's walk through thisreal quick here in this file,  <br>00:18:36.930 I'm just gonna search for sis checkto get to the SIS check section.  <br>00:18:41.760 That's hard to say.. And here right uh,  <br>00:18:44.100 you can see that I have the fileintegrity monitoring section.  <br>00:18:47.040 And you can see right here all thedirectories that is by default set to  <br>00:18:50.760 monitor.  <br>00:18:51.390 So what we'll do here is we'll justchoose a place amongst all these directory  <br>00:18:54.515 options and we'll add alittle configuration here.  <br>00:18:57.570 We'll type in directories and we'lladd an option that'll give us real time  <br>00:19:00.630 alerts. It's really simple what'scalled real time, just like that.  <br>00:19:04.025 Have it equal yes in quotes.  <br>00:19:05.310 We'll add one more optionreport underscore changes.  <br>00:19:08.400 Have that equal yes in quotes andwe'll add one more check underscore  <br>00:19:13.140 all and have that equal yes as well.  <br>00:19:15.780 So just to make sure we'reall on the same page here,  <br>00:19:17.370 we're specifying a directory and we'regiving it these options real time. Yes,  <br>00:19:21.150 report changes, yes. And checkall. Yes, we'll close that out.  <br>00:19:24.510 And then add the directory. We'regonna monitor with all these options.  <br>00:19:27.330 Let's see to our desktop.  <br>00:19:28.140 So we'll do CE colon slashusers slash your username.  <br>00:19:32.520 Mine is network check slash desktop.  <br>00:19:35.220 And then we'll close that out with aleft arrow forward slash directories just  <br>00:19:39.900 like this. So now we'llsave this file, file save.  <br>00:19:42.060 And then we'll restart the service bylaunching our terminal as administrator.  <br>00:19:44.940 Right click run as administratorand we'll say restart service.  <br>00:19:49.140 Dash name waza. [Cool.So](http://cool.so/) that should be good.  <br>00:19:52.140 So I'm gonna open up myWaza dashboard real quick.  <br>00:19:53.850 Make sure I'm on the events tab.Notice and look at the last 24 hours,  <br>00:19:57.060 nothing's happened. Let'schange something on our desktop.  <br>00:19:59.460 This is so cool and powerful. I hopethis illustrates how cool this is.  <br>00:20:02.250 She's gonna go to my desktop and I'mgonna add a new file, new text document.  <br>00:20:06.210 Can you see this? Just takeabout five seconds. One, two,  <br>00:20:10.830 let's take a look. Let'srefresh this. .  <br>00:20:15.030 There it is. No, it's weird.I said added, deleted, added.  <br>00:20:17.850 Oh I think because they changedthe name in real time. But look,  <br>00:20:20.070 it monitored that I add a new, uh, anew file. Um, check this out. So that's,  <br>00:20:23.190 that's one alert. If I change anythingabout it, let's open it up. Say, Hey,  <br>00:20:27.090 I'm changing stuff. We'll save it,we'll see if the new alert comes in.  <br>00:20:30.030 I'll refresh my optionshere or refresh my page.  <br>00:20:32.520 There it is sis check eventmodified. And it's like, Hey,  <br>00:20:35.670 the check sum changed on this.  <br>00:20:37.350 It'll even tell me down herewhat I changed the text Iadded. How crazy is that?  <br>00:20:41.880 Now we can do the same kind ofthing with the Windows registry.  <br>00:20:44.070 Now it won't be real time,they don't have that option,  <br>00:20:46.590 but it will scan every 12 hours.You can change that interval.  <br>00:20:49.300 Let me share real quick. We can [specify.So](http://specify.so/) right now Pilic was an inventory,  <br>00:20:53.170 right? We can see that it does havean inventory. Look at our new file.  <br>00:20:56.710 It does have an inventory of registeredkeys that automatically monitors,  <br>00:20:59.920 but we can add specific onesthat we want to have seen.  <br>00:21:02.050 So let's add a custom one real quick.  <br>00:21:03.460 I'll open up a red edit herein Windows to edit my registry.  <br>00:21:07.090 Let's add one inside. Uh, I don't know,hq, local machine. We'll go to software,  <br>00:21:11.440 maybe classes. And let's add oneright here, right click say New key,  <br>00:21:16.420 we'll say Bernard Hack. Well bam,  <br>00:21:20.080 we'll change the value to something fun.  <br>00:21:22.780 So what I'll do here is I'll right clickthis key and say copy key name and then  <br>00:21:26.590 we'll go back to ouragent configuration file.  <br>00:21:28.960 And you'll notice just under that samekind of section where we're adding  <br>00:21:31.660 directories, we also haveregistry keys we can add.  <br>00:21:34.240 So I'll go kind oftowards the bottom here,  <br>00:21:35.860 just underneath the last registry entryand right before the entry to ignore,  <br>00:21:41.590 I'll line myself up with everythingelse, type in Windows registry,  <br>00:21:46.390 paste my key name,  <br>00:21:47.680 and then close it out with a left arrowforward slash Windows registry and a  <br>00:21:51.730 right arrow. Cool, thatshould be all we need.  <br>00:21:54.100 And it'll change thefrequency cuz like I said,  <br>00:21:55.900 it's gonna take 12 hours to findthis. We don't want it to do that.  <br>00:21:59.110 So up here we have frequency that CIScheck is executed by default every 12  <br>00:22:03.280 hours. 43, 200.  <br>00:22:05.200 Let's change that from thatto 60. So every, every minute.  <br>00:22:10.060 Actually let's do 30 seconds. Let'sbe quick. So I'll save this file.  <br>00:22:14.290 I'll restart my service. My was aservice to once some more restart.  <br>00:22:17.410 Service name was a Got it go. Cool.  <br>00:22:19.570 So getting back to our WASA dashboardhere in our integrity monitoring section  <br>00:22:22.870 for our Windows machine.  <br>00:22:24.130 I'm gonna go over here to inventory andjust see if it finds that new registry  <br>00:22:26.800 key. I'll go to registry, I'll searchfor, what do we name it Bernard?  <br>00:22:31.660 Nothing yet. Way for it to findit. There it is right there.  <br>00:22:34.510 So it found the key. It's lookingat it, it's monitoring it. Cool.  <br>00:22:37.660 Now let's go to events. Now you seethat we've got some registry changes,  <br>00:22:40.600 mainly time and we're getting thatbecause we were setting it to every 30  <br>00:22:43.420 seconds. Notice nothing about aregistry key here. Let's go change it.  <br>00:22:46.210 Let's go modify it. Hammer Bernard, hack.  <br>00:22:47.805 Well I'll change the valueto something else. Fun  <br>00:22:52.930 or you got hacked. Cool, let's changeit there. It'll take about 30 seconds.  <br>00:22:57.280 Take a little coffee break andlet's monitor our was the dashboard.  <br>00:23:00.610 I'll refresh it a few times. And ohthere it is. Register key modified.  <br>00:23:04.540 How killer is that? Now you may bewondering, okay, big deal Chuck,  <br>00:23:07.870 I'll barely even know there.But when does registry is,  <br>00:23:09.615 why do I care if it'schanged? And first of all,  <br>00:23:11.260 the registry like has these settingsfor the configuration of your operating  <br>00:23:14.620 system. So if things are changedhere, it's changing everywhere else.  <br>00:23:17.860 Some common things you might seechanged, especially with malware.  <br>00:23:20.530 Is this key here? Does it seem MicrosoftWindows? Where's it at? Where's it at?  <br>00:23:25.450 Windows Current version. There'sa lot of keys in here man.  <br>00:23:28.480 And we have run and runonce these keys are changed,  <br>00:23:31.630 when you add like a new startupapplication for your system.  <br>00:23:33.910 So what malware will do is I'll go inhere and add a new key new string value.  <br>00:23:37.810 Call this, I'll call this bad stuff andI'll just say internet explorer .  <br>00:23:42.705 Let's, let's copy that location.Okay? And looking back at Waza,  <br>00:23:46.580 it does monitor that by default. Andhere in the events, if I refresh it,  <br>00:23:50.180 there it is. Registerkey added and modified.  <br>00:23:53.090 There's the name of it right there. Badstuff. That's pretty powerful, right?  <br>00:23:56.600 The next thing I wanna show you actions.They're so powerful. Check this out.  <br>00:24:00.530 Let's go to our agents here and I'lljump into my Linux machine here.  <br>00:24:04.070 Circs Network, Chuck. Now let's go tosecurity events and I'll jump to events.  <br>00:24:07.730 Now there'll be a lot of eventshere because this machine's public.  <br>00:24:10.010 Now I'm getting things like attemptto log in using a non-existent user.  <br>00:24:13.430 Getting Bruteforce from Russia usingthe user name Pie . That's funny.  <br>00:24:18.230 Anyways, we can do something with that.And actually I wanna try it myself.  <br>00:24:21.800 I'm gonna try in brute force,  <br>00:24:23.030 I'm gonna launch my Callie Linux machinehere and I'll use hydro to brute force  <br>00:24:26.270 the login and I'll use theusername, uh, Bernard Hack.  <br>00:24:29.185 Well and we'll see ifit sees us. Ready, set,  <br>00:24:32.150 go after a pseudo password. Herewe go. Okay, it's attacking.  <br>00:24:36.530 We should see a log. Let's go look atthe logs here. Security events. Events.  <br>00:24:40.760 This happened just now. Let'ssee if it was us. Use your name.  <br>00:24:44.330 Bernard Hack Wall. So there,there we are. How cool was that?  <br>00:24:46.910 Let's stop that nonsense. Let's realquick. See if I try to log into it. Okay,  <br>00:24:51.565 so I, I'm getting a passwordprompt so I'm not being blocked.  <br>00:24:53.960 So clearly I can sit here and just tryand try and try again to my heart's  <br>00:24:57.410 content.  <br>00:24:57.950 But what if I had our seam activelyrespond to that and add it to the block  <br>00:25:02.450 list, drop it, add it to the firewall.We can do that. Check it out.  <br>00:25:05.750 It's called active response, whichcan be used for so many things.  <br>00:25:08.480 But I wanna demo this realquick. Now, to change this,  <br>00:25:10.490 we're gonna go to theconfiguration of our was a server.  <br>00:25:13.040 So we're gonna go here to the was a menu,  <br>00:25:14.480 go to management and thenclick on configuration.  <br>00:25:17.150 From here we're gonna go to the topright and click on edit configuration.  <br>00:25:20.420 And we're gonna scroll down a bit untilwe see a section called active response.  <br>00:25:24.170 Actually, you know, why am I tripping?I'm just gonna search for it.  <br>00:25:25.910 Active response. Cool, thereit is. Active response.  <br>00:25:28.670 So scroll down a bit untilI see this right here.  <br>00:25:31.520 It's kinda giving you a formatfor what it should look like.  <br>00:25:33.980 And I'm gonna copy this config fromthe documentation. Thank you Waza.  <br>00:25:37.940 Check it out here. Command is firewall,drop location, the server. It's uh,  <br>00:25:42.355 the rule is executing on and then it'sgonna look at a rule or it's looking for  <br>00:25:45.355 a rule. This rule is whattriggers this firewall drop.  <br>00:25:48.140 Now when we tried to brute force whatrule was triggered? Let's go find out.  <br>00:25:51.620 I'm gonna jump to uh, ouragents. Go back to my circ Circs,  <br>00:25:54.980 go to security Events. Events andlet's see, it was just earlier, right?  <br>00:25:58.675 Like at 33. Yeah. So here's the alert.You can see yes, it was Bernard Hack.  <br>00:26:02.780 Well and there's the alert IDright there. The rule ID 57 10.  <br>00:26:07.130 That's what we want it to alert off of.  <br>00:26:08.780 So let's go back to our configurationthing here and we'll change that rule from  <br>00:26:12.590 57 63 to 57 10 and this willtime it out or add the firewall  <br>00:26:17.360 rule. And the time outhere is 180 seconds.  <br>00:26:19.610 It'll block the attacker for 180seconds. Pretty cool. So let's save that.  <br>00:26:23.540 Click on save, restart our manager. Justgive that a little, little bit of time.  <br>00:26:27.380 Here're starting, please wait,coffee break. Okay, it's restarted.  <br>00:26:31.790 Now what we wanna do nowis go back to our agent,  <br>00:26:33.710 go back to Search network Chuck andwe'll go to security events and go to  <br>00:26:37.760 events. So last thing we saw agentstarted and stopped. Refresh that. Okay,  <br>00:26:41.570 we're here now let's go and tryto brute force it one more time.  <br>00:26:44.100 Actually real quickly, see if we canlog in. So this time I'm gonna use Root.  <br>00:26:46.980 I know a real user on that system.Let's see if it lets me. Okay, so we're,  <br>00:26:50.460 it's allowing us right now. Nowwe don't have to brute force.  <br>00:26:53.070 We can just try to login with Bernard Hack.  <br>00:26:54.630 Well what that should do is trigger.Now it's right now it's 1203.  <br>00:26:57.870 It should trigger that new activerule. Let's go see. Bam. There it is.  <br>00:27:02.190 So 1203 attempt. Attempt to log inwith non-existent user. Bernard Hack.  <br>00:27:06.120 Well immediately the firewall at dropactive response blocks me. So now,  <br>00:27:10.890 right now for 180 secondsanyway, if I even try to log in,  <br>00:27:14.105 even with a real user, Iget nothing. I'm blocked.  <br>00:27:18.570 I can't even ping it., it's kinda crazy.  <br>00:27:21.210 Let's do a continuous ping and see whenit lets me out outta jail here. Oh,  <br>00:27:25.500 we're back. We're back. Okay, so howcool is that? And just so you know,  <br>00:27:28.710 you can do those active responses basedon a variety of rules. It's so custom.  <br>00:27:33.095 That's why this is so powerful.  <br>00:27:34.350 You can even do it off of like a certaincommand was run or a certain log came  <br>00:27:38.670 about in, in the system you can run aa, an active response. It's so crazy.  <br>00:27:43.740 Now two more things I wanna show youreal quick. First is vulnerabilities. Um,  <br>00:27:47.280 right now if I go to my search network,Chuck and I go to Vulnerabilities.  <br>00:27:51.300 Nothing there. Why? Becauseit's not enabled by default.  <br>00:27:54.270 The system does not search for that. Soit's really, really easy to set this up.  <br>00:27:57.750 We'll go to waza management configuration.  <br>00:27:59.940 Just like before we'llgo to edit configuration.  <br>00:28:02.070 And here we're gonna search forvulnerability detector. Right there.  <br>00:28:06.605 It tells us enabled. No,let's change that to yes,  <br>00:28:10.680 we definitely want that. Then we clickon save and restart Manager, confirm now.  <br>00:28:15.000 So once this restarts, noticethe options it has here.  <br>00:28:17.880 It'll run a full scan every six hours.  <br>00:28:19.680 It'll also run on Start when the servicestarts up. So once this finishes,  <br>00:28:24.090 we'll restart our service and Windowsand Linux and see what happens. Okay,  <br>00:28:27.815 cool. It's done there.I'm gonna go to Windows,  <br>00:28:30.030 restart my service here andwe're restart my service here.  <br>00:28:32.550 I restarting was at Agents.Cool. So now at this point,  <br>00:28:35.880 and if we check our agents, I'lljust go to my Windows machine here,  <br>00:28:38.340 go to vulnerabilities. Cool. Soscan's complete, didn't find anything.  <br>00:28:42.210 Now the reason for that is that my Windowsmachine has like no apps installed on  <br>00:28:45.660 it,  <br>00:28:45.750 but just know to enable the vulnerabilityscanning you have to enable it on the  <br>00:28:49.470 system, on the Waza server. But theagents have that configured by default.  <br>00:28:53.250 Now if I go back to my other server thathas all kinds of fun stuff configured,  <br>00:28:57.300 I gotta get logged back in here.Chloe, she has a bad version of vlc,  <br>00:29:00.990 media player, high severity cde.Wow, look at that, dude, this is fun.  <br>00:29:05.520 Gives you all the details ofit. Oh my gosh, it's so cool.  <br>00:29:08.280 But I wouldn't have known that if Ididn't have this on her system and it just  <br>00:29:11.340 tells me automatically.  <br>00:29:12.780 Now speaking of telling you automaticallyyou'll need some sort of alert, right?  <br>00:29:16.740 Waza has that. They've gotemail alerts and Slack alerts.  <br>00:29:19.380 I'm gonna show you Slack realquick. How to set that up.  <br>00:29:21.570 The first one I'll do is open on Slackand create a new channel just for waza  <br>00:29:25.170 Waza alerts.  <br>00:29:27.870 Now I'll go out to Slackand create a new app.  <br>00:29:30.990 Now this will not be a tutorialon how Slack apps work.  <br>00:29:33.870 I'll just walk you through the basicsyou need to know about right now.  <br>00:29:35.970 And this goes without sayingyou do need a Slack account.  <br>00:29:39.270 So I'll click on create new appfrom name it was uh, alerts,  <br>00:29:44.080 select my workspace, create the app.  <br>00:29:46.210 And then all I wanna add really isan incoming webhook. Activate it.  <br>00:29:49.300 And then at the bottom I'll clickon add new webhook to workspace.  <br>00:29:52.720 I'll click on new channel WazaAlerts Allow. And that's it.  <br>00:29:56.920 And all I need from this is thiswebhook url. I'll copy that,  <br>00:30:00.250 get back to my Wza dashboard.  <br>00:30:02.440 And I'm gonna go back tothat configuration pagewhere we were at before where  <br>00:30:04.660 we spent a lot of time. Clickon Wza, go to management,  <br>00:30:07.395 and then go to configuration. Same thingas before. Click on edit configuration.  <br>00:30:10.900 And here I'm gonna search forintegrations or just integration.  <br>00:30:15.340 And it looks like I don't have asection for that. I'll just add it here.  <br>00:30:18.130 So I'll just go to the top and just underglobal and I'll paste this config from  <br>00:30:22.330 the documentation.  <br>00:30:23.440 The only thing I'll change hereis pasting my webhook right there,  <br>00:30:26.230 which I need to copyagain, paste it there.  <br>00:30:28.360 And actually there is one more thing Iwanna change just in case you don't wanna  <br>00:30:30.975 be killed with alerts because this default setting will have a bunch of  <br>00:30:35.470 alerts sent to me basedon like all the events.  <br>00:30:37.840 And of course you can change the severitylevel of events that are sent to you  <br>00:30:41.260 or even just specify a specific ruleID you're looking for. So for example,  <br>00:30:46.000 right underneath here I can addrule id. And what do you say we do?  <br>00:30:50.110 57 10. That same rule as earlier that weare doing the action roll off of. Cool.  <br>00:30:54.850 So we have our web hook in place,  <br>00:30:56.260 the url we have our rule to alert offof Save it, save and restart manager.  <br>00:31:00.610 Once that is restarted, we'll doour little test here in a moment.  <br>00:31:03.070 And real quick, look, there'snothing in the uh, waza alerts yet.  <br>00:31:06.250 It's kind of quiet here.Cool, it's restarted.  <br>00:31:08.320 Now let's try and log in withBernard Hack. Well again,  <br>00:31:13.900 that should block us. Andthen over here, BAM was alert.  <br>00:31:18.105 Actually hit my watch too. Was I alert?Look at that invalid user. Bernard Hack.  <br>00:31:22.690 Well, from this IP address, which I'mgonna have Nick or Austin block right now,  <br>00:31:27.610 that's awesome, right?

(it's safe)  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/ey4u7OUAF3c](https://www.youtube.com/watch/ey4u7OUAF3c)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.090 In this video we're going to exposeyour home network to the internet.  <br>00:00:04.440 Now don't be scary.  <br>00:00:05.280 This is completely secure and kind ofcrazy actually cuz we're not punching  <br>00:00:09.520 holes through your firewall,  <br>00:00:10.520 which is what you might do with areverse proxy like engine X or traffic  <br>00:00:13.560 forwarding and exposing ports 80and 4 43. Now we're not doing that.  <br>00:00:17.760 Instead we're creating a tunnel.  <br>00:00:19.440 And with this tunnel we cansecurely expose anythingon your home network to the  <br>00:00:24.640 internet, a website, prox,walk Porter, anything.  <br>00:00:27.800 And I'm telling you this is nuts.  <br>00:00:29.320 Everything you expose will haveits own sub-domain and SSL cert.  <br>00:00:33.560 Even if you only have a ACTTP or a self-signed cert,  <br>00:00:36.560 we're setting up CloudFlare Tunnel afree service that allows you to connect  <br>00:00:40.360 securely to your home networkresources from anywhere.  <br>00:00:43.200 And it doesn't matter whatkind of home network you have,  <br>00:00:45.320 I know some of you your is P sucks andyou got CG nat and all that doesn't  <br>00:00:49.600 matter, this will work. Settingthis up is super simple.  <br>00:00:52.280 It'll only take a few sip ofcoffee. Here's what you need.  <br>00:00:55.710 Coffee being one of those things.First you will need a domain name.  <br>00:00:58.560 I'm gonna set up one realquick with Google [Domains.It](http://domains.it/)'s about 12 bucks a year.  <br>00:01:01.800 It's just the cost ofdoing business. Second,  <br>00:01:03.640 you'll need a computer or server insideyour home network and this can be  <br>00:01:07.640 running pretty much any OS and um,I think you might have one, right?  <br>00:01:10.640 And it's on this computer or server thatwill install CloudFlare Tunnel and then  <br>00:01:14.560 it will tunnel out to CloudFlare andit's through that tunnel that we can tell  <br>00:01:17.720 CloudFlare to route pretty much anysub-domain to anything inside our home  <br>00:01:21.960 network, SSL cert and all. And yeah,that's pretty much all you need.  <br>00:01:24.920 Let's get our coffee and getstarted. But before we get started,  <br>00:01:27.560 I wanna talk about this,  <br>00:01:28.740 the computer or server that you're usingin your home network. And like I said,  <br>00:01:32.400 anything will work.  <br>00:01:33.100 But I want you to try and start usingRed Hat Enterprise Linux or Rel Rel.  <br>00:01:37.560 Rel Rel Red Hat is the sponsor of thisvideo making this video happen And I've  <br>00:01:41.760 recently started using Red Hat Enterpriselinnux and My Home Network. But why?  <br>00:01:46.220 Two reasons. Number one,  <br>00:01:47.520 red Hat Enterprise linnux is the flavorof linnux at enterprise companies use.  <br>00:01:51.520 You know the big companiesthat you may want to work for,  <br>00:01:53.960 they use the stuff and for a lot ofreasons, reliable, secure, standardized.  <br>00:01:57.840 It's the gold standard if youwant to run Lennox professionally,  <br>00:02:00.640 enterprise Lee in your network.  <br>00:02:03.220 But it's also not free usually.  <br>00:02:05.870 I've got a little surprisefor you here in a bit.  <br>00:02:07.640 Now getting back to the point 0.1 thatit's used by enterprise companies.  <br>00:02:11.000 Why do you care?  <br>00:02:11.870 Well for me the point of having a homelab doing all the stuff in my crazy  <br>00:02:15.640 office is to get hands on experiencewith enterprise IT stuff so I can learn  <br>00:02:19.640 skills that make me more valuable.  <br>00:02:20.880 So a company might hire me to dothe stuff I'm doing in my house.  <br>00:02:23.650 So it just makes sense if companiesare using Red Hat Enterprise Linux,  <br>00:02:27.120 the companies that may hire you one day,  <br>00:02:29.050 it makes sense to put thatinside your home network,  <br>00:02:31.240 inside your home laband learn how to use it.  <br>00:02:34.050 So maybe you can put on your resume,Hey I run this stuff at home now.  <br>00:02:37.560 Number two, why you might want to useit, why you should use it right now.  <br>00:02:40.040 If you're a company it's not free, butif you're you an individual, a person,  <br>00:02:45.070 make sure you check that I'm not a robotthing. Do a puzzle. Okay, you're good.  <br>00:02:48.560 You can sign up for Red Hat'sdeveloper for individual subscription,  <br>00:02:51.880 which includes a free versionof Red Hat Enterprise Lennox,  <br>00:02:55.240 and not just a free version. You canactually license up to 16 servers.  <br>00:02:58.680 And those servers can be asbeefy as you want them to be.  <br>00:03:01.240 So all you have to do right now ischeck my link in the description,  <br>00:03:03.600 get signed up and once you're loggedin you can check out your subscription.  <br>00:03:06.440 There's mine right here. I'veonly used one server so far.  <br>00:03:09.040 And to download your Red Hat EnterpriseLinux, go to downloads at the top Lyft,  <br>00:03:12.760 there it is right there.  <br>00:03:13.680 Click on the little icon here and saydownload latest and I'll grab that 9.1  <br>00:03:17.680 right now. The one thing I love about Rel,  <br>00:03:19.560 that's how the cool kits say it is theyhave a web console for your server,  <br>00:03:23.080 which is a beautiful gooey that allowsme to manage pretty much everything about  <br>00:03:26.680 my server, including containersrunning on that thing.  <br>00:03:29.810 So if you wanna run your homelab like an enterprise company,  <br>00:03:32.280 check out Red HatEnterprise Linux link below.  <br>00:03:34.720 That's what I'm gonna use rightnow to set up my CloudFlare Tunnel.  <br>00:03:37.280 I'm gonna head out to Google Domainsby Googling domains. We're here.  <br>00:03:40.600 I would like to get a new domain soI'll click on that search for man,  <br>00:03:44.360 what should it be?

Click continue.  <br>00:04:21.899 Now no matter what domainprovider you're using,  <br>00:04:23.960 you'll need to use CloudFlare asyour name servers. How do we do that?  <br>00:04:27.320 I'm gonna show you rightnow. So here on this page,  <br>00:04:29.280 I'm gonna scroll down justa bit and click continue.  <br>00:04:31.360 And right here on step four,our Cloudflare's name server,  <br>00:04:34.920 whatever you have there,you'll use both of these.  <br>00:04:36.320 So I'm gonna jump backover to Google Domains,  <br>00:04:38.120 click on DNS and using my eyeballs,  <br>00:04:40.840 I'm gonna try and find custom nameservers. There it is right there.  <br>00:04:44.070 I wanna change my nameServers to something custom.Here we go. Copy Clarissa.  <br>00:04:47.760 Clarissa explains it all.Copy Evan. Click on save.  <br>00:04:50.480 And then Google's kind of tricky.  <br>00:04:51.720 You have to click on switchto these settings at the top.  <br>00:04:53.680 Once you do that and we're done. Nowthis could take a moment. They say,  <br>00:04:56.320 oh it can take up the 24 [hours.It](http://hours.it/) rarely does. It might though,  <br>00:04:59.570 so like don't get mad at me. Mineusually takes like a few moments.  <br>00:05:03.250 So getting back to CloudFlare,  <br>00:05:04.440 I'll click on done check name serversand I'll click on finish later for this,  <br>00:05:07.480 I'll do it later and I'll click oncheck name servers once more. Come on,  <br>00:05:10.160 really check it now it should reflecthere and you'll also receive an email  <br>00:05:13.160 telling you, hey it [happened.So](http://happened.so/) we'll give that a moment.  <br>00:05:15.560 Coffee break and lookat that. Mine is done.  <br>00:05:17.720 Took a little less than five minutesso not too bad time for step three,  <br>00:05:21.160 set up our CloudFlare tunnelhere in CloudFlare land.  <br>00:05:24.240 We're gonna scroll down just a bit onthe side panel and click on zero trust  <br>00:05:27.880 because you can't trust anyone exceptfor me.

Elon Musk Comb Lap.  <br>00:05:46.910 Next again, scary pagewhere you're like, Chuck,  <br>00:05:48.880 I thought you said this was free and itis. It's just over here. Hidden kind of.  <br>00:05:51.760 I want the free plan.  <br>00:05:52.520 I'm selecting that Proceed to paymentof zero while they have to use that  <br>00:05:55.560 language. Now even though it is $0,  <br>00:05:57.840 it still doesn't want a payment on filesimilar to AWS and but it shouldn't  <br>00:06:01.880 charge you anything cuzagain, zero is zero, right?  <br>00:06:04.240 So let's click on next and then clickon purchase for our $0 purchase. Okay,  <br>00:06:08.720 we're good. Now we canactually click on tunnels.  <br>00:06:10.970 So let's get back to access and tunnelsand let's create our first tunnel.  <br>00:06:14.400 This is so crazy. Click on Create tunnel.  <br>00:06:16.480 Let's name it ElonMusk's House Save tunnel.  <br>00:06:20.180 And this is stupid easy. I told you youcould pretty much install this anywhere.  <br>00:06:23.840 They have all the flavors. Myfavorite flavor is gonna be Docker,  <br>00:06:27.120 but whatever you got,  <br>00:06:28.150 just click on these guys andI'll have the code you can run.  <br>00:06:30.680 So I'll click on Docker and I'll copythis snippet of code right here and here  <br>00:06:34.040 on my Red Hat Enterprise Linux machinewith Docker installed. Let's make sure,  <br>00:06:38.140 yes, I'm going to paste that code,  <br>00:06:40.280 although I will make one change herewhen I control A to get my cursor to the  <br>00:06:43.360 very beginning and just after a run,  <br>00:06:45.000 I'm gonna add a dash D for Damon soit runs in the background and then hit  <br>00:06:49.040 enter. Done. It's running sun. Now I getback to my cloud flare dashboard here.  <br>00:06:53.080 I'll click on next and time to routemy first service. So check this out,  <br>00:06:56.760 I'll do my proxima server first. SoI'll do prox mos, select my domain,  <br>00:07:00.280 which I already have set up Elon muskhome [lab.com](http://lab.com/). I'll select my service type,  <br>00:07:04.120 which will be HTTPS S for prox max.  <br>00:07:06.960 And then the internal privateIP address to my prox max server  <br>00:07:10.260 10 77, 73 port 8,006.  <br>00:07:14.660 Now you can see that CloudFlare Tunnelis acting kind of as a reverse proxy,  <br>00:07:18.670 except it's not exposing your homenetwork to the big bad internet.  <br>00:07:22.920 Insecurely unsecurely. It's safe.  <br>00:07:25.120 Now for services like Prox mos thathave self science certificates,  <br>00:07:28.110 I wanna click on additionalapplication settings.  <br>00:07:30.360 And under TLS I can say no TLSVerify. So it'll be okay with that.  <br>00:07:35.040 Then click on save Elon Musk'shouse tunnel and boom. So right now,  <br>00:07:39.000 a bunch of cool things happening.First, my tunnel is active.  <br>00:07:42.040 That means that whatever I did onmy Red Hat enterprise Lennox server,  <br>00:07:44.590 it's working. We're connected. I didn'thave to do anything to my firewall.  <br>00:07:47.950 I didn't have to really do much copy andpaste. You can do that. I can do that.  <br>00:07:52.200 It's awesome. Okay, anyways,so let's test it out.  <br>00:07:55.040 I'm gonna navigate out tocrocs mos dot elon musk home  <br>00:07:59.360 [lab.com](http://lab.com/) and it, it's working ,  <br>00:08:03.980 how cool is that? I'm logged in. Let'stry a connection from the outside.  <br>00:08:07.120 I'm gonna launch my chasm workspacehere, which is hosted in LE node.  <br>00:08:10.400 Open up a brave browser,  <br>00:08:11.600 which is outside my home network andI'll do the same thing I'm in and all the  <br>00:08:15.440 products mock stuff worksflawlessly. Check this out.  <br>00:08:17.800 One thing that doesn't work great withEngine X and traffic without a lot of  <br>00:08:22.680 work is the console. It works greathere. Now looking back at CloudFlare,  <br>00:08:26.400 all we need is that one tunnel foreverything. So if I click on configure,  <br>00:08:29.910 I can add more public hostnames. Let's add another one.  <br>00:08:32.720 Let's add my Sonology nass.  <br>00:08:34.159 So I'll just do NASS elonmusk home [lab.com](http://lab.com/) type HTS URL  <br>00:08:39.289 on port 5,001. I'll make surethere's no TLS Verify save host name.  <br>00:08:43.679 Let's test it out. Nas dot elon musk [homelab.com](http://homelab.com/) and look at that . How,  <br>00:08:47.760 how easy was that?  <br>00:08:48.990 I don't have to worry about let's encryptcertificates or really just anything.  <br>00:08:53.170 It just, it just works. And there's thatbeautiful SSL shirt right there, man.  <br>00:08:57.960 Now you gotta admit that's the easiestway you've seen to expose your home  <br>00:09:02.000 network's resources tothe internet. I mean,  <br>00:09:04.040 just a few clicks and you can host yourown website on a raspberry pie inside  <br>00:09:07.720 your house no matter whattype of network you have,  <br>00:09:09.660 and people can securely access it.CloudFlare is changing the game.  <br>00:09:12.900 Let me know if you, um, hacked to YouTubetoday that like boat notification,  <br>00:09:16.640 bell comment, subscribe. You gotta hackYouTube today ethically, of course.  <br>00:09:19.960 And for real, just let me know belowif you did this and how cool it is.  <br>00:09:23.680 I just wanna, I wanna geek out with you,so get some coffee and let's geek out.|### SUMMARY  <br>Me presenting a video on exposing home networks securely to the internet using CloudFlare Tunnel.  <br>  <br>### IDEAS:  <br>- Exposing your home

(Docker Containers STREAMING Kali Linux to your browser)  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/U7e-mcJdZok](https://www.youtube.com/watch/U7e-mcJdZok)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.030 What I'm about to show you is theultimate hacking workspace. No joke.  <br>00:00:03.910 This technology is nuts. Andhonestly, I use this thing every day.  <br>00:00:08.200 Change the game for me,completely like check this out.  <br>00:00:10.520 I may be researching hacking stuff, andthere's some sketchy links out there.  <br>00:00:13.080 But with one click,  <br>00:00:18.750 just like that, a new browseropen, but it's isolated, secure.  <br>00:00:22.390 Heck it's not even on my [machine.Is](http://machine.is/) it a bad link? I don't care.  <br>00:00:25.890 Not my machine or maybe I want a fresh,  <br>00:00:27.550 clean and sense of call Lennoxfor some quick hacking or testing.  <br>00:00:30.340 Boom right here in my browser seconds.And when I'm done, boom, blow it up.  <br>00:00:34.350 Like it never existed.  <br>00:00:35.330 Or maybe a spin up two and have 'em attackeach other Cali and Navy U boom too.  <br>00:00:39.210 And no, this doesn't involve some heavyvirtual machines or WSL two it's Docker  <br>00:00:43.540 containers streaming to yourbrowser. What, in the best part,  <br>00:00:47.480 I'm gonna show you how to setthis up in about five minutes.  <br>00:00:50.120 Me and Cameron are hi. That's mybrother. It could be in the cloud.  <br>00:00:52.700 It could be in your house. And myfavorite part, it's completely free.  <br>00:00:55.900 Thanks to our sponsor. Chasm [workspaces.So](http://workspaces.so/) get you coffee ready or tea.  <br>00:00:59.900 If you're a loser, shut up. Let's do this.  <br>00:01:04.110 So end up talking.  <br>00:01:05.050 Let's talk about what you needto actually get this thing going.  <br>00:01:07.110 The list is not long. That's the goodnews. Cameron tell 'em what we need. Oh,  <br>00:01:12.130 I was not ready for this. nowall you pretty much need is a server,  <br>00:01:15.650 which might sound scary, but it'sjust a small server. That's it?  <br>00:01:18.170 Cameron tell 'em what we need. Go ahead.  <br>00:01:24.560 I know you're staring at me. So hereare the minimum survey requirements.  <br>00:01:27.330 We're gonna be two VCPS, four gigsof Ram and 50 gigabytes of storage,  <br>00:01:32.700 SSD preferred. And this applies to cloudor OnPrem, which could be your house.  <br>00:01:36.540 But we're gonna show you both. Thanks,Cameron. got my chair. See how,  <br>00:01:40.640 what Cameron set. That's prettymuch it. Well, one more thing.  <br>00:01:43.330 You gotta have coffee, everything init requires coffee or tea. Shut up.  <br>00:01:46.870 Never Chuck duck coffee.Now I know you're ready.  <br>00:01:48.790 I know you're itching to get starteddoing this, but first, before we do that,  <br>00:01:51.910 I wanna talk about the magic behindhow this actually works. Now,  <br>00:01:54.710 if you don't care about that,go ahead and skip forward.  <br>00:01:56.230 I got time stamps below,but chasm is so cool. I, I,  <br>00:02:00.230 I think I just wanna tellyou about it. Actually.  <br>00:02:01.590 I don't wanna tell you about it. Cameron'sgonna tell you about how chasm works,  <br>00:02:04.800 how the magic of Docker containerstreaming to your browser  <br>00:02:09.630 works. I said works a lot.Anyways. Cameron saved me.  <br>00:02:13.380 here's how chasm works. Soyou install chasm on your server. Now,  <br>00:02:16.340 if you wanna open up a secure web browser,  <br>00:02:17.760 or even an instance of call Linux chasmwill automatically open this up in a  <br>00:02:21.260 Docker container and streamit to your browser. He works.  <br>00:02:23.700 Isn't that cool camerabe more excited anyways.  <br>00:02:27.070 And it does this using chasmsproprietary software called chasm B,  <br>00:02:30.900 which is it's it's open [source.It](http://source.it/)'s open source. There we go.  <br>00:02:36.010 oh yeah. One thing.Camera move. Gimme your pen.  <br>00:02:38.850 So these Docker containersare just regular containers.  <br>00:02:41.440 They're actually on Docker hub andyou can just pull them from there.  <br>00:02:44.920 You can go look at 'em and you can evencreate your own custom Docker images,  <br>00:02:48.560 container things.Anyways, here you go. Oh,  <br>00:02:50.880 also also think about the start camera.One way is you can put it in the cloud.  <br>00:02:53.320 We're gonna show you how to do that.This is my cloud. Shut up camera.  <br>00:02:55.900 And whenever you're surfing the internetor doing some hacking stuff in Cali,  <br>00:02:59.540 um, you're using theclouds IP address. So,  <br>00:03:02.760 whereas normally you'd be going directlyto your ISP using your home internet IP  <br>00:03:06.840 address using chasm. You'rekind of hiding yourself a bit,  <br>00:03:10.250 especially from your ISP, keepingyourself a bit anonymous and you,  <br>00:03:13.540 you could be anywhere you could be atStarbucks drinking, coffee or tea .  <br>00:03:17.820 So,  <br>00:03:18.040 because you're chasm server is installedon your business network or your home  <br>00:03:21.510 network, you have access to everythingthat is on your network. Like,  <br>00:03:24.910 think about that cameranot being excited enough.  <br>00:03:26.530 You have access to your Sonology insideyour home network or all that stuff.  <br>00:03:29.430 Like just all your stuff, your,  <br>00:03:30.790 all your other home lab stuff remotelythrough dock container streaming,  <br>00:03:34.070 just magic, magic, magic. Butthat's the basic of how chasm works.  <br>00:03:37.170 But now you wanna set it up, but I'llhave Chuck walk you through that. Yeah,  <br>00:03:41.020 yeah. Hear you tea drinking. Wooy allright. nothing wrong with tea,  <br>00:03:45.400 but you know, coffee's better. Okay.  <br>00:03:47.300 Now time to actually installchasm on our server, uh,  <br>00:03:50.260 like Cameron was talking about, he justtook freaking forever to explain it.  <br>00:03:53.120 I'm just kidding. He did a greatjob. Let us know how he did guys.  <br>00:03:55.400 If you wanna see more of Cameron, ifyou don't, we're gonna show him anyway.  <br>00:03:58.400 Now we mentioned that we can installall this pretty much anywhere,  <br>00:04:01.030 but the two I'm gonna show youis the cloud. And then, uh,  <br>00:04:03.950 OnPrim AKA your houseor your business. Now,  <br>00:04:06.490 thankfully the differencebetween the two is not a lot.  <br>00:04:08.810 It's pretty much the same, but let'sfocus on the cloud first. Now, you know,  <br>00:04:11.490 my favorite cloud provider,  <br>00:04:12.430 my favorite thing to do and use is Linodemainly because if you've never used  <br>00:04:16.610 'em before you get a hundred dollarsfree credit right now to sign up.  <br>00:04:19.510 So you much get to try this out for [free.So](http://free.so/) just shut up and do it link below.  <br>00:04:24.060 So with your Len node account setup,  <br>00:04:25.570 we'll first go to create at the topleft and, uh, well create, click on it,  <br>00:04:30.060 create a Len node from here.  <br>00:04:31.600 We're just gonna do our best to meetthe minimum requirements. First,  <br>00:04:34.060 the images we're gonna rock UbuntuUbuntu 20 0 4. Don't use 21.  <br>00:04:39.560 yeah, he's right. I tried 21did not work 20 0 4 El least. That's at,  <br>00:04:43.470 at the time of this recording,I'm losing my mind anyways,  <br>00:04:45.790 too much coffee already.  <br>00:04:46.470 How you doing T boy we'll then selectour regions somewhere close to you.  <br>00:04:49.150 And then for the plan, this is wherethe minimum requirements come in. Um,  <br>00:04:51.830 dedicated. I don't need that. Idon't have that kind of money.  <br>00:04:53.890 I'm doing shared CPU. And the minimumrequirement will be this guy right here.  <br>00:04:57.120 Leino for gigabits orbites. Sorry, not bits.  <br>00:04:59.630 Four gigs of delicious Ram over arehere. And then two virtual CPUs.  <br>00:05:03.080 And we got plenty of hard repspace. Cause the minimum is 50 gigs.  <br>00:05:05.840 So this satisfies ourminimum requirements.  <br>00:05:08.010 Then I'll label it my chasm password.  <br>00:05:12.120 And that's pretty much it I'llclick on create Lin node. No, yeah,  <br>00:05:14.940 20 bucks a month.  <br>00:05:15.760 That's not the $5 a month we'renormally doing with these projects.  <br>00:05:18.360 That's because chasm is extra cooland require some extra, extra stuff.  <br>00:05:22.470 Now also keep in mind, I'm showingyou Le node. You can do this in AWS,  <br>00:05:25.890 digital ocean,  <br>00:05:26.610 pretty much any cloud provider thatcan produce virtual machines for you,  <br>00:05:29.490 which is all of [them.It](http://them.it/)'ll work now for on-prem.  <br>00:05:32.320 This will vary based onwhat you're using for me.  <br>00:05:34.450 I got prox Mo and all I'll do is createa VM. Make sure I'm doing UBO 2 20 0 4.  <br>00:05:38.170 Make sure my hard driveis at least 50 gigs.  <br>00:05:39.690 I go and throw like maybe75 at it for no reason,  <br>00:05:42.780 two virtual CPUs and four gigsRam. Again, this may vary for you,  <br>00:05:46.700 but that's pretty much the gist. Okay.Back to the node. Once yours is running,  <br>00:05:49.830 it's done provisioning.  <br>00:05:50.770 Let's go ahead and grab thisIP address and get logged in.  <br>00:05:53.080 Or you can copy the one over here.  <br>00:05:54.230 Copy launch your favorite terminalprogram on the windows. So I've got CMD,  <br>00:05:58.210 it'll be terminal on Mac and [Lennox.It](http://lennox.it/)'ll be SSH route at your IP address,  <br>00:06:01.900 hit enter fingerprints. Yep. And thenenter your password that you set earlier.  <br>00:06:05.370 We're in now the installation of chasmis actually the easiest part of this  <br>00:06:08.320 entire tutorial. So easy that I feelcomfortable letting Cameron do it. So, uh,  <br>00:06:12.020 go ahead, cam. All right.  <br>00:06:12.840 So the first thing we're gonna do hereis actually for stability and we're going  <br>00:06:16.100 to get a swap partition.  <br>00:06:17.590 We're gonna put in this first commandto actually create the swap partition.  <br>00:06:20.960 We're gonna upgrade the permissions,actually make it into swap.  <br>00:06:24.370 And then we're gonna turnon the swap partition.  <br>00:06:26.360 These four commands are gonnabe below in the description.  <br>00:06:28.810 You could actually just copy and pastethese in and make the swap partition.  <br>00:06:31.410 And just to make sure that wemade our swap successfully,  <br>00:06:34.130 we can use the cat command to look insideof the swap file. And I can see here,  <br>00:06:38.520 we have our swap partition now to makesure that our swap will come back.  <br>00:06:42.460 Whenever there is a reboot, let'sgo ahead and just run this command.  <br>00:06:44.800 And this will add this to the Fs tab file.  <br>00:06:47.160 Now that we have theswap partition set up,  <br>00:06:49.400 we can now download the installationfile using the w get command.  <br>00:06:53.680 And you can see we're actually gettingthis from S3, go ahead and enter and,  <br>00:06:57.550 and let's get that downloaded.  <br>00:06:58.950 And now let's just run an LS realquick just to make sure that the file  <br>00:07:01.930 downloaded correctly. So thisfile is in the dot GZ format.  <br>00:07:05.590 So we will need to unzip this inorder to get the installation file.  <br>00:07:08.950 So let's paste that command in thereand that will extract it to our current  <br>00:07:12.210 directory. And we can now see thechasm release folders right there.  <br>00:07:16.480 Then we will do pseudo bash and thatwill just run this installation script.  <br>00:07:20.510 Then they'll want us to accept the enduser license agreement, just hit yes.  <br>00:07:24.140 And enter. And this installation'sgonna take a little bit,  <br>00:07:26.500 so go take a coffee break. We'llget back to it in a second, man.  <br>00:07:29.640 Those are pretty fast install.Wasn't it? Yeah, I'm kidding.  <br>00:07:32.340 Now on our screen here, uh, theygive us some credentials. Uh,  <br>00:07:35.640 the only really important ones herefor us are gonna be the admin one.  <br>00:07:38.560 Let's go ahead and grab 'em all just incase and just paste these into a note.  <br>00:07:41.770 And once you have that past it away,  <br>00:07:42.840 let's get back to Le node andlet's copy our IP address,  <br>00:07:46.220 open up a new tab and let'sdo HTT PS call slash slash and  <br>00:07:50.990 let's paste in the IP address ofour ode hit advanced and proceed.  <br>00:07:55.010 And now let's paste in this credentialsthat we saved a second ago, right?  <br>00:07:57.790 When you log in, you'll be presentedwith the chasm console. Uh,  <br>00:08:00.700 the first place they log youinto here is the admin portion.  <br>00:08:03.920 So you'll notice a lot ofsettings and stuff here.  <br>00:08:06.270 We're not gonna get to that right now.We'll go into that later in the video,  <br>00:08:08.970 what we're mainly focused on here,  <br>00:08:10.410 it's just the workspaces portion andthat's where all the fun stuff is.  <br>00:08:13.280 Now we can move over to workspaces andwe're just gonna pick Chrome for this,  <br>00:08:16.290 that launch session andboom, just like that.  <br>00:08:19.570 We have a containerized browser streamingto our computer. All right, Cameron,  <br>00:08:23.110 get on my seat. Yep. That's thebig stuff. That's the basic stuff.  <br>00:08:27.010 and at this pointyou're pretty much done.  <br>00:08:29.130 Like you've got your chasm insulationgoing. You can access your stuff.  <br>00:08:32.330 And if you go back to the actually toget back to let me show you how to do  <br>00:08:34.770 that. When you're sitting herechilling in your instance, here,  <br>00:08:37.419 there are little dots on the left. Look,those dots, you can do a few things.  <br>00:08:40.940 One of the main things we care aboutright now is getting it back to our  <br>00:08:43.000 workspace. Click those four littledots, more, a lot of dots here,  <br>00:08:46.520 and you can launch other stuff.  <br>00:08:47.580 So they've got dedicated apps that againwill just launch a Docker container.  <br>00:08:51.080 But these are apps you can launchright now from G, which is, uh,  <br>00:08:54.760 like drawing stuff like Photoshopoffice, just a terminal.  <br>00:08:57.580 If you want a terminal Ubuntuand even visual studio code,  <br>00:09:00.320 which I'll just launch that realquick is pretty cool. And bam,  <br>00:09:02.400 just like that visual studio codestreaming to me from a Docker container,  <br>00:09:05.720 which still is just, isn't that crazy.  <br>00:09:08.040 a Docker container streamingand shoot even a to browsers,  <br>00:09:11.160 browsing in a browser on a virtualmachine, in the cloud using tour.  <br>00:09:16.370 And it's inside a Docker container.  <br>00:09:17.630 There's so many things happeningwith tech-wise. It's like,  <br>00:09:20.130 it hurts your brain to thinkabout it, how you're doing this.  <br>00:09:22.520 Can't get more secure thanthis or anonymous. Now, again,  <br>00:09:25.750 you're pretty much done. Like you couldleave the video and be happy about this,  <br>00:09:28.810 but you know, we can't end there.There's some more cool things you can do.  <br>00:09:31.310 Like, I don't know if you notice, butwhen we are back in our portal here,  <br>00:09:35.020 click over back on admin dude.  <br>00:09:37.260 this is more than just like atoy we can play with. This is a full,  <br>00:09:41.030 crazy enterprise system tool, which again,  <br>00:09:44.180 it takes 10 years to tell you all thethings it can do and walk through that.  <br>00:09:47.560 But I will show you just a few things.  <br>00:09:49.140 I think you'll love and you'll wannado right now. Camera say right now,  <br>00:09:52.590 right now, now the firstthing you may want.  <br>00:09:54.460 And it's the first thing I wantwas the ability to take like,  <br>00:09:57.010 like remember the intro we had likemaybe nefarious links like this one,  <br>00:10:00.830 you may not wanna open that inyour browser, on your main desktop.  <br>00:10:03.300 There could be all kinds of crazystuff that affect your computer.  <br>00:10:06.430 So we want to be able to right,click that and say open and chasm,  <br>00:10:09.770 open a Docker container. That's safe,secure, and isolated. That won't hurt me.  <br>00:10:13.110 How do we do that? Now? Thisis simply a Chrome extension.  <br>00:10:15.650 And if you name brave or Firefox,I believe they have Firefox.  <br>00:10:18.790 I'll check on brave, but I'msure they have all of it.  <br>00:10:20.560 We're simply gonna add an extension orinstalling extension on our browser.  <br>00:10:23.540 So I'm just gonna look forChrome extension store.  <br>00:10:27.160 I think that's what it's called.Yeah. Just Google that jump in there.  <br>00:10:29.540 And we'll search for chasm at the topleft. There we go. I love the tagline.  <br>00:10:33.160 Open an isolation. In fact, Camerontold me about that. It's pretty cool.  <br>00:10:35.670 Anyways, we're gonnaclick on, add to Chrome,  <br>00:10:37.520 click on ad extension and it'sadded, but not quite done yet.  <br>00:10:41.430 We have a few more thingswe have to configure here.  <br>00:10:43.070 We're gonna go up toour puzzle piece here,  <br>00:10:44.190 which stands for extensions in Chrome.  <br>00:10:45.640 We're gonna scroll down until we seechasm, which is weirdly great out.  <br>00:10:48.550 It makes me feel weird, but it's fine.  <br>00:10:49.750 We're gonna click on the threedots and click on options.  <br>00:10:54.080 We're gonna change just really onething here. We're gonna add the URL for,  <br>00:10:57.080 for our chasm server that we just setup or the one that you just set up.  <br>00:11:00.400 So a past mine in here just likethat. And you can even choose, like,  <br>00:11:03.820 if you wanted to open a new windowor a new tab, I like new tab.  <br>00:11:06.300 It feels more like it'spart of my browser.  <br>00:11:07.530 Like I'm not doing anything outsidemy system, even though I totally am.  <br>00:11:10.260 So anyways, enough of that clickon save and that part's done.  <br>00:11:12.540 Just one more thing we have to do.  <br>00:11:13.870 We're gonna get back to our chasmworkspace here, our chasm dashboard.  <br>00:11:16.880 And from here, we're gonnago to the top, right?  <br>00:11:18.700 Click a little icon thereand then click on profile.  <br>00:11:21.070 Cuz this will be a settingthat is set per user. And yeah,  <br>00:11:23.910 you probably guess you canhave multiple users with this.  <br>00:11:26.270 You can have your friends, yourfamily, your kids use this,  <br>00:11:28.850 have different profiles. We'lltalk about that. Anyways.  <br>00:11:31.790 One thing we're gonna change right here.We have the default workspace image.  <br>00:11:34.920 This is what we'll launch. Wheneveryou do that, right. Click thing.  <br>00:11:37.290 We showed you earlier, clickon the dropdown and then choose your image.  <br>00:11:40.980 I'm gonna choose. Let's do brave. I likebrave. That's it. It's already saved.  <br>00:11:44.680 I don't have to do anythingelse. And now we can test it.  <br>00:11:46.480 It's gonna go back to that Redditpage and I'll pick a random link here.  <br>00:11:49.160 This guy right here, right click.And here we are open link and chasm.  <br>00:11:53.160 And just like that,  <br>00:11:54.080 a Docker container is being spun upbehind the scenes and it's streaming to my  <br>00:11:58.400 browser. I'm not opening this URL onmy computer. It's not tracking me.  <br>00:12:01.760 It doesn't know my IP [address.It](http://address.it/)'s not looking at my cookies,  <br>00:12:04.080 looking at my history. I'm completelyanonymous. As far as tracking me goes.  <br>00:12:08.780 And the cool thing is whatever I dohere in this browser, it doesn't matter.  <br>00:12:11.880 I can do whatever I stinking. What?Because guess what? I can just delete it.  <br>00:12:15.030 Like watch this click on theselittle dots here, delete session.  <br>00:12:18.310 I can trash the sucker, bad website,malware, whatever don't care. I'm secure.  <br>00:12:23.270 So I deleted it. It's gone. I was neverthere. I never accessed that website.  <br>00:12:26.810 No proof. And I think, youknow, think about that.  <br>00:12:28.550 That's probably the future of howwe deal with weird stuff like this,  <br>00:12:31.730 how we browse the internetright now, your computer,  <br>00:12:34.160 it designed to track a lotof what you do, cookies, um,  <br>00:12:37.450 your IP address your history. Andif your computer could track it,  <br>00:12:39.980 that means all these other websites,your accessing can track it as well.  <br>00:12:42.440 Not to mention these scare ofviruses in malware, which yeah,  <br>00:12:45.300 and we've got tools that can prevent that.  <br>00:12:46.460 We got tools that canscan what we download, uh,  <br>00:12:48.980 prevent what we access on the internet.But you know what? They're not perfect.  <br>00:12:51.960 The ideal use cases that we open upeverything in an isolated sandbox.  <br>00:12:55.350 And if we do do something bad, it doesn'tmatter. That instance, that browser,  <br>00:12:59.280 that VM is transient. Ephemeralbig words. It just disappears.  <br>00:13:03.590 Cuz it doesn't matter. Now secondtweak. I wanna show you real quick.  <br>00:13:05.850 Check this out. It's actuallykind of two tweaks in one first.  <br>00:13:08.390 If you scroll through your appshere in your, your workspaces,  <br>00:13:10.650 you'll notice that you don'tsee Cali Linux, which we,  <br>00:13:13.070 we talked about that a lot, but it'snot here. Did we lie to you? No, no.  <br>00:13:16.380 You can add more images and someare already default installed.  <br>00:13:19.340 So if I go back to admin, my adminportal over here on the left,  <br>00:13:22.520 I can click on images where I can managethe Docker images or containers that I  <br>00:13:26.600 can launch. Go and click on that.  <br>00:13:27.940 And here we already have 26 imagesready to go, but not all are enabled.  <br>00:13:31.960 So I'll start clicking onthe arrows down here. Here.  <br>00:13:33.880 We have doom for some reason.  <br>00:13:34.890 So if you wanna play doom in yourbrowser from a Docker container street,  <br>00:13:37.510 actually that sounds prettycool. Anyways, let's continue.  <br>00:13:40.270 I wanna go find call there. Itis call Lennox to enable this.  <br>00:13:43.830 I wanna click that box for the can.  <br>00:13:45.080 We're gonna click on the little dotshere on the right click on edit.  <br>00:13:48.490 And then right here towards themiddle, we have the enabled check box.  <br>00:13:51.440 Check that now while we'rehere at the same time,  <br>00:13:53.450 I'm gonna go ahead anddo the second tweak.  <br>00:13:55.560 Now when we launch Kelly Linuxwithout changing this second thing,  <br>00:13:59.290 it's gonna log us in as aregular user without root access.  <br>00:14:03.360 But of course we want root access. Wewant ultimate godlike control, right?  <br>00:14:06.440 One thing we have to changehere to make that happen.  <br>00:14:08.680 If you scroll down just a little bithere, we have the Docker run config,  <br>00:14:12.310 which by the way, you cando a ton of stuff with like,  <br>00:14:14.580 this is like a regular container.And if you know Docker containers,  <br>00:14:17.590 you can do everything here prettymuch. But one thing we care about,  <br>00:14:20.530 we're gonna do some JSON real quick.Don't worry. It's not scary. Uh,  <br>00:14:23.450 just follow along with me first. We'regonna type in user between double quotes.  <br>00:14:26.610 I'll do double quotethe user double quote,  <br>00:14:29.480 then I'll do a colon and then I'll doanother double quote and say root and then  <br>00:14:34.050 double quote. So just like this, thatis be beautiful. JSON right there.  <br>00:14:37.220 That's all we need. Just go down tothe bottom. Click on, submit done.  <br>00:14:40.940 Now it's not quite readyyet. If we go to our, uh,  <br>00:14:43.760 workspaces here at the top left,you'll see it here. Where to go.  <br>00:14:46.940 Oh right there. But it's got like alittle warning message right now. Your uh,  <br>00:14:51.210 chasm server is downloading the Dockercontainer for Cali getting all that  <br>00:14:54.680 stuff. Ready? No give, give ita minute. Just coffee break.  <br>00:14:57.820 You tip my coffee [again.So](http://again.so/) now Cali is ready.  <br>00:14:59.820 I'm gonna go and launch the sucker realquick launch, which this is so cool.  <br>00:15:03.040 Right? And now that we have root enabled,all we have to do is when it launches,  <br>00:15:06.240 when we're in our terminal, like weshould be like you are right now.  <br>00:15:08.800 We'll do SU or switch userspit to become root. Okay.  <br>00:15:12.590 Now for the third tweak and it's thelast one I'm gonna show you cuz we don't  <br>00:15:15.030 have enough time andthis one's pretty cool.  <br>00:15:16.510 It involves users and web filtering sofar we've been using the admin profile,  <br>00:15:20.510 but of course you can add other users.  <br>00:15:22.210 So what I'm gonna do is add my daughtersas users, my two oldest anyway,  <br>00:15:25.470 Chloe and Addie.  <br>00:15:26.150 And what I'll demonstrate is how I canmake sure that they're gonna be browsing  <br>00:15:28.730 safely and securely and then law.They can access with web filtering,  <br>00:15:32.990 which is just built in,  <br>00:15:34.180 I can whitelist and blacklist withwhat I want them to access. So anyways,  <br>00:15:37.220 let's check it out real quick,super easy. So just like before,  <br>00:15:39.500 I'll go to my admin portalhere and over here on the left,  <br>00:15:41.940 I'll click on users right now.I've got the default users.  <br>00:15:44.140 I'll go ahead and click on adduser to add a new one, Chloe,  <br>00:15:47.560 and then I'll set a password forher. And now just keep in mind.  <br>00:15:49.880 I'm manually setting apassword for or Chloe,  <br>00:15:51.950 but you can integrate this with an L Dand SAML or single signon situation at  <br>00:15:55.930 your business. If you have one or ifyou have a home lab with that stuff,  <br>00:15:59.070 you can do it too, cuz I totallydo. And I will end up doing that.  <br>00:16:01.510 But username and password is pretty muchall we need for now. I'll click OnIt.  <br>00:16:05.080 I'll add my second user for add submit.  <br>00:16:07.710 So now all I have to do is give themmy IP address or the URL of my chasm  <br>00:16:10.970 instance and they can get accessto this with our credentials. Now,  <br>00:16:13.440 moving beyond that, Ican assign web filtering,  <br>00:16:15.550 very simple to set this up almoststupid, easy, uh, over here on the left,  <br>00:16:19.170 we'll see an option four webfilter. Go ahead and select that.  <br>00:16:22.340 And here we got nothing.Let's create something.  <br>00:16:24.300 Go ahead and click on ad policy. Nowwe don't have a ton of options here.  <br>00:16:27.920 I name this test, but some cool things,  <br>00:16:29.560 especially for kids or peoplethat you want to restrict too.  <br>00:16:32.890 We can say deny by default. So likewhatever website it is, don't go to it.  <br>00:16:36.270 Unless I explicitly say they're allowedto go to, which is perfect for my kids.  <br>00:16:39.310 They're curious.  <br>00:16:40.090 So I can say deny by default and theonly site that can access is network  <br>00:16:43.800 [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/) also network chuck.coffee.You just put that all on the black list.  <br>00:16:48.510 Thanks Cameron. He justsays on the black list,  <br>00:16:50.200 we're gonna put that in the whitelist. and just scroll down.  <br>00:16:53.340 We got a few more options or reallyjust one more enable safe search,  <br>00:16:56.300 which is a Google option to makesure they don't search for bad stuff.  <br>00:16:59.520 And then we could enable categorization.  <br>00:17:01.200 But that is a featurethat must be licensed,  <br>00:17:03.300 which you're probably thinkingChuck, you said it was free. It is,  <br>00:17:06.319 but not everything's free.This is a community edition,  <br>00:17:08.260 which is more than enough. Likeyou're gonna have a hard time,  <br>00:17:10.859 like not finding all the features youwant. We get a snapshot, the differences.  <br>00:17:14.150 And one thing I wanna pointout, and this is just crazy.  <br>00:17:16.050 Community edition is $0 and includes allfeatures of enterprise right.  <br>00:17:20.730 Then one of the main limits is thatyou are limited to five simultaneous  <br>00:17:23.690 sessions and excludes somebranding and web categorization,  <br>00:17:26.650 which is what I just hit. Actually,  <br>00:17:28.550 we can't take advantage of some crazyURL filtering your web categorization,  <br>00:17:32.110 but we get some pretty coolstuff anyway. And of course,  <br>00:17:34.080 if you wanna goprofessional or enterprise,  <br>00:17:35.900 and if you're a businessschool or government entity,this is perfect for you.  <br>00:17:38.820 But anyways, let's continueanyways. That's all we care about.  <br>00:17:40.760 I'm gonna click on submit. Andthen one more thing we have to do.  <br>00:17:42.920 We have to apply this policyto our users to do that.  <br>00:17:45.240 We'll go over here tothe left, to our images.  <br>00:17:47.390 This will be applied per imageand I'll find, for example, brave,  <br>00:17:50.330 let's go and click on brave clickon the icons here, click on edit.  <br>00:17:53.340 And if I scroll down justa bit and when I say a bit,  <br>00:17:55.560 I mean a lot wehave the web filter policy.  <br>00:17:57.830 I'll change this from inheritto my, there it is right there.  <br>00:18:00.800 My test one and click on [submit.So](http://submit.so/) now let's give it a test.  <br>00:18:03.920 I wanna go ahead and launch brave.  <br>00:18:05.020 It should apply to me as well andright off the bat access tonight.  <br>00:18:08.570 So I try to go to Googleor Facebook, nothing,  <br>00:18:12.010 but I try to go to network chuck.com.What if I try to go to network [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/).  <br>00:18:15.930 Hey, real quick, Cameronand Chuck from the future,  <br>00:18:18.170 we figured out that it doesn'twant the HTTPS in there at all.  <br>00:18:20.850 So go ahead and take that out and justhave the domain name in there soon.  <br>00:18:24.270 Now let's go back to our workspaces.Find our brave web browser,  <br>00:18:27.450 go and launch the sucker. It shouldwork for me. You should block me.  <br>00:18:30.140 I am all users and by default it shouldblock the first website it comes with.  <br>00:18:33.260 Yeah, access denied. But now if we goto network, chuck.coffee, for example,  <br>00:18:38.980 naked by coffee. No [problem.My](http://problem.my/) daughters can too. Now it was cool.  <br>00:18:42.540 And check this out. If I go back to mydashboard and I go to my admin portal,  <br>00:18:45.320 if I scroll it like notice real quick,  <br>00:18:47.240 we have insight into everything goingon with thought our chasm instance here,  <br>00:18:51.010 or our chasm server, all theimage usage, all the errors.  <br>00:18:53.990 And then down here atthe bottom domain usage,  <br>00:18:56.190 we can track what our people are going to.  <br>00:18:58.510 So think about thatfrom a user perspective,  <br>00:18:59.830 as you're trying to protect your company'susers, uh, or your kids or whatever,  <br>00:19:04.030 you get a crazy amount of insight andcontrol. Okay, I gotta stop there.  <br>00:19:08.050 there are a ton more featuresI could talk of about like casting,  <br>00:19:11.240 which you can share your session withother people and they can watch you do  <br>00:19:13.640 stuff, uh, staging, which is crazy. Makesthings go faster, just so much more.  <br>00:19:17.800 I can't go into it. And by the way,if you do want to go into that,  <br>00:19:20.400 if you wanna learn how to do this,we'll have a little minicourse below.  <br>00:19:23.200 Check it out.  <br>00:19:23.860 But now I wanna change gears for asecond because I've shown you some cool  <br>00:19:26.400 stuff.  <br>00:19:26.640 I've shown you two use cases like securebrowsing and having a really awesome  <br>00:19:30.200 line X distro, just bamexploded onto your browser.  <br>00:19:33.770 But how do companies use this? Howcould you use it as a, a daily grind?  <br>00:19:37.610 How can you apply it to what you do now?  <br>00:19:39.840 There are some pretty cool use casesabove and beyond what we've already showed  <br>00:19:43.590 you. So now I'm gonna kickit off to Cameron. Cameron,  <br>00:19:45.580 show the people some cool stuff I'mgonna see Beardie right.  <br>00:19:48.990 So now that we're done going over justpersonal use case for like browser  <br>00:19:51.970 isolation, or maybe standing upyour own call Linux or Rubi desktop,  <br>00:19:55.270 there are some more use cases forthis that are a little less personal,  <br>00:19:58.170 more like business or enterprise suchas replacing your VDI solution. Uh,  <br>00:20:03.060 maybe your company right now usesCitrix. Citrix can be really cumbersome,  <br>00:20:06.730 hard to set up licensing. It'shard. What's great about it.  <br>00:20:09.980 That it's web native.  <br>00:20:10.500 You don't have to have anything asstalled on your endpoints in order to use  <br>00:20:12.940 chasm, you can have it justrun through any web browser,  <br>00:20:15.480 because if you ever use Citrixor any of the other stuff,  <br>00:20:17.530 you have to install crapon people's computers.  <br>00:20:19.130 It sucks and worry aboutversioning on the desktops, blah,  <br>00:20:23.530 none of that and chasms images areall secure outta the box because they  <br>00:20:27.530 constantly update theirrolling images every night,  <br>00:20:29.530 because the old way to do stuff is stupid.  <br>00:20:32.700 You would have a golden image thatadmins would like go into log into and  <br>00:20:36.240 update, like apply updatesand apply the patches of crap.  <br>00:20:39.230 This is like it's auto magic, automagic, and last but not least,  <br>00:20:43.760 it could be used for DevOps pipelines.  <br>00:20:45.440 So whether you want to testyour own custom doc Docker, ah,  <br>00:20:48.270 docking Docker containers or your code,  <br>00:20:51.020 you can use their secure APIs that areprovided with chasm to test that. Thanks,  <br>00:20:54.560 Cameron. All right. So chasm seriously.  <br>00:20:57.420 I'm gonna probably usethis every single day.  <br>00:20:59.700 I'm legit gonna have mykids use it. Cameron,  <br>00:21:01.200 you're gonna use this thing always,always forever. And I I'm being serious.  <br>00:21:04.520 I do just constantly spinup news stuff, new VMs.  <br>00:21:07.930 And this is a way easier way to do this.  <br>00:21:09.670 If I just wanna test something realquick or if I wanna browse to kind of a  <br>00:21:12.990 weird URL and not worryabout getting hacked,  <br>00:21:15.850 not to mention all the crazy usecases that Cameron mentioned,  <br>00:21:18.900 it's a pretty cool thing.  <br>00:21:19.710 So thanks again to chasm workspaces forsponsoring this video and making such a  <br>00:21:23.390 freaking cool product and like, yeah,I know they did sponsor this video,  <br>00:21:26.650 but I only say yes to things I reallylike and enjoy and will actually use  <br>00:21:30.820 myself, especially when it's free andaccessible to pretty much everybody.  <br>00:21:34.160 So I dunno what you're waiting for.If you haven't already tried it,  <br>00:21:36.060 if you didn't followalong this video, do it.  <br>00:21:38.800 And it's right now right now is whenyou gotta do it. And if you did it,  <br>00:21:42.460 let me know what you thoughtcomment below and uh, by the way,  <br>00:21:45.770 have you hacked YouTube algorithmstoday? Let's make sure you do that.  <br>00:21:49.250 Like button notification, bellsubscribe, and already said comment.  <br>00:21:52.270 So just do that. You gotta hack YouTubetoday. Ethically of course. And yeah,  <br>00:21:56.650 that's all I got. Thanks again to mybrother, Cameron, for helping out today.  <br>00:22:00.470 Let me know again, if you wanna seemore of him, if you don't, I don't care,  <br>00:22:03.130 I'll still include him. Oh. Andalmost forgot by the way. Um,  <br>00:22:06.210 we are gonna include more tutorials,more of a deep dive on chasm,  <br>00:22:09.680 how to do all the kind of crazy cool stuffthat we didn't include in this video.  <br>00:22:13.250 Check it out.

There's a lot of people I see asleep on this They're They're asleep on this Chuck They're not paying attention Do you think the roles we have now with like IT engineers network engineers will exist in 5 years um I have a question that's kind of been keeping me up at night Is there a future for network engineers in the age of AI like in 5 years are we going to exist that's why I'm here at Cisco Live the largest networking conference in the entire world And I'm asking this question I need the answer I'm asking Cisco people I'm asking network engineers who come here 22,000 of them hey what do you think about AI are you worried do you currently use AI is this a thing for you and let me tell you this year feels different for network engineers Everywhere you step everywhere you look AI AI AI The opening keynote Chuck Robbins AI G2 Patel AI Everything is AI So here we go Let's dive in Okay First walking up to Cisco Live the conference center AI everywhere Every sign every advertisement it's the AI era We're powering AI Every booth in the world of solutions had something to say about AI We kind of have a reason to be a little bit worried about AI In fact I just saw a Reddit post today where someone who had just gone to Cisco Live they're like "Huh are we going to be okay?" It's a very question I'm trying to answer dayto-day And by the way this video is sponsored by Cisco They brought me out to Cisco Live and they gave me the freedom to make whatever I wanted Thank you Cisco team You are amazing Now my first mission was to figure out how people feel about AI Are they optimistic are they scared um I can tell you that I touch AI almost daily for almost everything I do for work So AI how do you feel about it are you optimistic are you excited are you all in you get all in or you get all out How do you feel about AI oh I love AI I use it almost every day So really okay So you're optimistic about it oh yeah I think it's the future I mean everything's going to have AI in it going forward And if you don't learn it now you're going to get left behind So I'm optimistic Great I know AI has been around but in a different form than what we're used to right now right so AI now I think it'll actually enhance all of our experiences Right I'm optimistic about it I've used it for both college and personal like creating experience So you use AI now yep Um I know my colleague here is not so keen on it really I'm indifferent I mean I think it's neat for security and like medical stuff but right all the GPT and all that stuff It's neat but I don't care Now overall people seem to be pretty excited about AI They're optimistic They think that AI is going to make their lives better because it already has And I know for me it has in some ways and the more models that come out and the the better I understand how to use it it does actually help me with some things but not everything We'll get to that later Then I wanted to see okay network engineers IT people how are they actually using AI are they using it with their jobs and not just with their everyday life stuff with AI are you using it right now in your job i am How are you using it mostly for uh code ciloting and stuff that I don't want to do We actually just started about a year ago and we're actually going heavy into AI We're a utility company right so we're finding ways whereby AI could help us automate a lot of stuff that's you know done manually right now So I mean we talk we talk about about this all the time Um AI is an assistant to what you do And so you are the gatekeeper of what you allow AI to do or not do to your infrastructure Um we I think it's encouraged today to leverage that assistant next to you I know you and I when we talked first talked about automation back what five six years ago uh we were starting the whole DevNet thing and we talked about okay so is automation going to change the way I manage my network and is it going to take my job and and and and here we are we're just talking about automation as a skill as something that you should adopt as part of your tool set when you're working with your network AI is the same um my company we're we're trying to use AI where we can um I You don't want to rely completely on AI but it's a great starting point I mean I'll give you for instance I had to write a document uh really an ITIL document on that So okay I go to co-pilot C-pilot write me a document based based on ITIL you know give me a policy document So it gives me a policy document Okay make these changes making these changes gets me like 60% of the way there in minutes At that point now I can take it and do my own thing I wouldn't take that document and put it forward and said "Here's my document." Right Right Don't do that but it's 60s something percent of the way there and now it's a really easy way to say okay where do I go from there rather than sitting at a blank page and going what do I AI is just another tool um and I've been talking this week a lot about ways that network engineers can use AI today to make themselves better engineers so an example I I I will sometimes go into is you're you know you've got some piece of knowledge buried deep in the back of your head but it's buried under dust and cobwebs and too many late nights with pizza um you could go try to dive through it or go into it But I like asking AI cuz I know if I see the right answer I was like "Yeah that's the right answer I can dive in." So verification of information great use case for it Now speaking of using AI one of my first interviews I actually had was sitting down with John Capo Biano This guy is a ball of energy I love him Thank you for sitting down with me John He's a former Cisco employee but now he has left and he's working for an AI company called Selector AI I wanted to sit down with John because he's kind of at the forefront of networking with AI on Twitter He's the first guy I see messing with MCP agent to agent agent ops all those buzzwords And I asked him the same question Are you optimistic about AI why do you think it was that you were more excited versus like we're doomed well I see it as um like the computer is for human convenience Now I'm old I'm very old My first computer didn't come with a mouse Oh The mouse was a peripheral that was screwed into the back on a serial port And now I could move the mouse around Okay I know it sounds hilariously trivial and I'm really old but it's about convenience is it not mhm So now instead of menus and gooies and clicking and memorizing commands and I can use my own natural intuition and just sus out questions in a conversational way Now should we be frightened uh I think we should be a little frightened right there's with the great power comes the great responsibility but it's an opportunity Chuck I see this like like the protocols we just talked about MCP and ADA Why they've got me so excited is because they're protocols like HTTP or SMTP or spanning tree protocols Your code can work with my code because we're developing them with standards It's not the wild west anymore Right And it's very much like the late 90s mid 90s where protocols suddenly changed the world Right Right Think about HTTP hypertext transfer protocol and HTML What did that do for the world right it brought us online Yeah it did Yeah So now these new MCP tools are going to bring us even further with artificial intelligence So you're overall optimistic i'm optimistic I'm optimistic So of course obviously John works for an AI company He's pretty optimistic But I loved one of the last conversations I had with Hank Preston Now hint Preston if you don't know who he is he when I first met him he was the Python network automation guy back in 2018209 a big shift in networking was happening we as network engineers and admins were being told that we have to become developers in fact Susie we got to the stage and said hey you guys are developers now and that kind of scared a lot of network engineers including myself like are we going away is our job going away guess what it But Hank was at the forefront of that He had an amazing session that everyone flocked to He was like the guy those years and he was showing us how to start using network automation and Python with network automation This is a key thing I want you to remember We're going to touch on that later But one of the last things that Hank said to me and Jeremy as we were talking to him was that he said "You have to be optimistic about AI What else are you going to do?" And that's I kind of feel like where everyone is We're choosing to be optimistic you have to to wake up in the morning and continue on with this network engineering journey Now do we have a reason to be optimistic that's still what I'm trying to figure out The next thing I wanted to know is are these people worried so they may be optimistic about AI but are they worried about network engineering are they worried about their own jobs no I think the role is changing Back then networks were not what they I mean licensing what isn't what it is today So so you look at how networks has progressed since then It's the same thing I I think a network engineer that's saying like well I just you know I I build switches I plug that's not an engineer it's a jockey um that whole that whole job has changed over the years Yeah So now you think about like you know you look at catalyst center you can deploy switches very quickly So using uh using the tools in catalyst center to deploy how many switches right away Yeah that's true So so the job itself has changed and I think everyone understands that and they need to you know learn the new stuff and and move forward with that So one thing about AI is yes there might be job loss but also creates opportunity for you to learn new stuff and you know remain relevant So I'm not worried about that at all I actually embrace it I think it's going to be overall net good for everybody Yeah you know do you what's your take on AI as far as the job market goes do you think it's kind of scary like we're going to start losing jobs or what do you think i would say like 25% jobs of the current form will go away New jobs have come but it will not like gap all the beaches bridges but it will come different things So like as a current technology like here the tech expert I would say like people try to get familiar with it like the way we get oursel familiar with apps smartphones we should get familiar with it and get on top of it and take it like another cuisine right you are just trying out another cuisine just don't be afraid of it right so I don't think that networking as a career is going to diminish I think it's going to become more and more specialized more and more specialized to support you know high performance computing or GPUs or large language models in the data center Um I think we still have 3 to 5 years of a safety net I don't think that it's going to be that revolutionary and that fast Beyond 3 to 5 years it's really hard to project or predict I think the time for skepticism is behind us I think that everyone who is using AI has an advantage over people who are not using AI Okay Right And as we have this conversation if you're not using AI there are people are there are other people using it right and there's going to be a parody gap here And that is what I'm worried about are the people here that aren't using it that aren't paying attention that are going to wake up one day to a whole new reality that they're not prepared for Um at least today and and it some of this certainly will change as AI models get better Um but right now AI is not truly creative AI are mathematical models that are building on patterns and finding patterns that are there and giving you good information and it's fantastic at that And so one of the things that I think true humans are still necessary is for innovative ideas Um I'm also I try to be optimistic right the world is not for machines The world is for people and I think that we will recognize that there is still value in having people involved in the work not just the machines that are there Again optimism They think network engineering is going to be okay Many saying that network engineering will become even more critical as AI becomes more prevalent More data centers means more network engineers making those data centers work I like that viewpoint So I don't know about you but at this point I'm feeling pretty good I've talked to people at Cisco I've talked to engineers I've talked to engineers who love using AI and they're all feeling pretty good about it for now And that was my next question because right now AI is moving at a pace I can't keep up with Can you keep up with it it seems like every single week in fact just this week and I haven't looked at it yet or even played with it we had a new model 03 Pro come out So my question was in 5 years is the job of network engineer going to exist or system engineer IT engineer because in 5 years a lot can change I think they're going to change They've been changing Uh I think you're still going to have network engineers uh obviously still have managers like myself but uh you know the roles are going to be there but they're going to change because we have to change with the times you know uh you look at uh you look at cyber security you look at uh all the problems that are out there the bad guys are also using AI so they're getting quicker so we have to worry about that as well it it it's going to be different for sure yeah what's like uniquely human that you can do just that kind of thinking what's uniquely engineer right so you know you can't build a network unless you actually understand how networks network right right I mean we all know we've all seen networks where you're looking at that and like you're like who built that do do you understand it was AI AI built it Yeah You know so you know there will always be the need to be able to have a deeper understanding of how the network works Do you think the role of network engineer as we know it right now will that exist in 5 years it will We should be running the bots Oh definitely especially network engineers you know AI runs on the network so you're going to have to have the network there So I just see it making us uh more efficient you know if anything we're but we're never going to go away We're here to stay It's more of AI actually assisting actually seeing more visibility of the network and what's going on and give us more instead of working you know 12 16 18 hour days it actually allow us to work eight hour days Do you guys think that there will be a future for networking do you think the AI will take over networking uh I don't think so As it like I said as it currently stands now Definitely not In the future it's possible I think it's it's somewhere in the middle I think the the mundane tasks that we uh do daytoday are going to go away which means I don't need to SSH into a box I don't need to look at what's going on with my network that way I'm going to probably have an agent that do that for me But we talked about this like automation whether before AI you were supposed to do that anyway right with automation um do I think it's going to we're still going to touch the CLI I think at some level we will um it's going to probably be augmented with AI built into the terminal which I think it's out there today where you have your CLI you have an agent on your terminal that's helping you with commands I don't I don't know most of the iOS XC commands and I can't tell you how many times I go out to Cisco Docs or I go out to Google to search for it Now it's there So it's going to speed up It's going to it's going to make make me have superpowers um as a network engineer but I don't think it's going to make me obsolete I think that network engineer looks similar to the one that is today but they've in uh incorporated uh more security skills because again there's not a company I know of that wants an insecure network And and I I would also say someone that understands it not just from a network security standpoint but a cyber security standpoint understands red teaming understands pen testing understands blue teaming skills like incident response and threat hunting I also think that that's someone that natively understands automation I I I think that you know everybody thinks about AI almost like it's an easy button It's not If you really want to get the benefits of AI if you really want to feel them in your network you have to you have to automate more of your network uh operations and activities and that's going to be a big part of I think any uh CCNA CCNP CCIE engineer and what they're doing They're going to be thinking about how they can really drive that automation to get the benefits of AI Otherwise when I hear of people talk about oh it's all hype It's all hype until you really automate that network activity and I think that that's going to be a big part of the future work that our engineers are going to be doing Now this question I feel like had the most fun answers It became more practical for me For example Clark he said "We'll have 8 hour days instead of these 16-hour days that network engineers are normally faced with Waking up and and getting those calls Maybe AI removes being on call Wouldn't that be amazing?" Karine said that AI is going to give us superpowers It will augment us and make us better It'll do the things that we don't want to do And Josh reiterated that AI runs on the network The network powers it The more AI there is the more AI needs us Now my take on that I think it's optimistic and we have to be optimistic It's really hard to say what's going to happen in 5 years If we're honest with ourselves we will all say that we were all surprised where AI is at this present moment No one saw this coming I feel like we're going to be saying something very similar in five years And then I asked one more fun question It was a meme I saw on X or Twitter I don't know what to call it What do you call it still which side of the bus are you on and this assumes the premise that AI will eventually take half of all jobs Will you be on the left side where you're saddened by the idea of AI taking jobs you don't want it to happen You think people should be the ones working Or are you on the right side of the bus will you be overjoyed by the idea that AI takes jobs maybe we enter a postj job world Sure there's problems to solve Oh a lot more problems to solve with that scenario Where do you sit uh I'm the girl standing in the middle going it could do that and it could do that My jury's still out if you'll pardon the pun I'm somewhere in the middle Somewhere in the middle Okay Lots of jobs be happy to hand off to AI I'm on the AI's going to take all our jobs right okay And I'm and I am an outlier right like I I have my own unique uh take on this but it is it to me it being AI and large language models and natural language and chatting with the computer It it is like the promise of the last 30 40 years I feel like we've been on this trajectory and we're sort of reaching the operand of Mo's law and some of these right we're really starting to maximize our compute power and I I again I believe in a utopian outcome now whether or not we it's going to cost a lot of jobs I think that as yes some jobs will be displaced but you know two years ago there wasn't such a thing as a machine learning engineer right so new emerging categories of jobs will will come out Uh I would say for me somewhere in the middle um maybe towards the the left a little bit where is it is AI going to destroy half of all the jobs i don't think so And I I I want to say this and this is something that we we we overlook often which is humans engineers um network engineers have this thing that AI doesn't have which is critical thinking and so you built your critical thinking uh skills from learning from uh troubleshooting networks from experience right that AI does does not have the capability to do that critical thinking skills Now I think I'm somewhere in the middle as well There are jobs in history that don't exist anymore and should not exist Like lamplighters That was a popular example that the CEO of Anthropic used when he was talking about "Hey wake up Jobs might be taken In 2 to 3 years we might see 50% of jobs gone." But also I think that we need to work People need to work People need purpose We should never remove people from these jobs AI should always be there to help us but never replace us And that's a common theme I heard many many times throughout talking with everyone in all these interviews is that AI isn't going to replace you but someone using AI will But then John Capo Biano and he comes in with the craziest notion and many people do hold this view He was fully on the right side of the bus And then the keynote happened The opening keynote at Cisco Live is where they announced all the crazy stuff they're doing And shocker they talked about AI a lot Chuck Robbins opened with saying that the AI race is on We have to move forward We have to be quick because everyone is trying to have the best AI We have to make it secure We have to make it the best We all know that every company every organization every government around the world There's also a defensive mechanism There's a FOMO element about what are you doing in AI and I agree There's no stopping it The only thing we can do now is sprint forward as fast as we can I get that And then G2 Patel took the stage One thing he said stood out to me With the help of agents or AI we can take the 8 billion people in the world and augment them in a way to where we have a throughput a workforce throughput of 80 billion people So 8 billion humans will feel like we have the throughput capacity of 80 billion humans He then went on to say that we're going to have a different looking workforce We'll have humans of course maybe but we'll also have AI agents AI apps robotics and humanoids That's terrifying but it's going to happen And then they announced something pretty cool and also pretty terrifying They announced their own purpose-built AI model for networking It's called the deep network model It's been trained on a ton of networking related data and tasks And similar to how they benchmark other AI LLMs on coding task this one they gave it a CCIE test labs and exam and it performed 20% better than the other leading LLM models They actually announced something similar at RSA conference but it was security focused I think it was called the security foundation model I did try it out It was okay But then Cisco showed us something pretty crazy They're putting AI in the data center and they're doing it with a thing called AI canvas It's a new control panel that's all about AI it's AI first and they gave a demo in which this guy was troubleshooting a connectivity error and this demo was live real time and he simply just chatted with this interface which I believe was the deep network model and it started doing things that man humans just can't do It's multimodal so it was generating graphs and charts about the network in real time Graphs and charts that we could drag on over to the main canvas real time dashboard creation which honestly is amazing But then they showed one more terrifying thing They had the model figure out a configuration like produce a QoS policy or a cost policy for me quality of service and then he asked it to apply this policy So at this point this is something a network engineer would have done We would have gotten into the routers the switches wherever this QoS policy would need to be applied We would have troubleshooted it figured out the configuration and applied it The AI did this for the guy operating this I forgot his name And all he had to do was just tell it his intent What do you wanted to happen in regular human language not CLI speak like we spend so long learning when we're studying for the CCNA and CCMP which brought me to a conversation I had with Kareem Escander and Joe Clark Kareem is part of the team that actually brought me out to Cisco Thank you Kareem How do you teach them to use AI and then make sure they're using it right how do you have a CCNA exam that's measuring if they're using AI effectively along with troubleshooting a network one of the ways we we think we can do this well first of all we might have to reconsider how we evaluate exams So in the real world you would have Google you would have chat GPT Instead of doing a lot of multiple choice memorization like you just said imagine if your exam allows you access to an LLM allows you access to a search and instead of multiple choice you're dropped onto a web portal for Moroi or you're dropped into a CLI and you actually when it says configure when it says implement you have to configure you have to implement The second part of your question is towards how do you get them to think critically about what AI is coming back with We think there's an opportunity to present them with um artifacts like this is the topology diagram of the network These are the configurations of the network This is the prompt and this is what the LLM said What do you think is the right answer what do you think is the most accurate response the AI has given you and if they've studied if they've prepared if they've played with some of that LLM with something like Cisco modeling labs in a simulated environment they should be able to answer that They should be able to say "Ah you can't do that interface there." Or it says "We're not allowed to run this protocol in our network so I can't trust that answer It has to be this answer." So what we're seeing right now is people say "You need to learn AI You still need to learn the CCNA but you need to learn all the new tools." A big focus that Joe mentioned was learning how to interpret the results of an AI So when you're talking with an LLM and being able to see if it's giving you bad data or it's hallucinating Okay so let's close this up I came to Cisco Live to figure out is there a future for network engineers this year We had an attendance of 22,000 people 22,000 people that care about networking that were there to learn about networking to kind of get a forecast for the future What are we supposed to be learning the overall take of many people I talked with was they're optimistic They're using AI every day in their job and they're actually excited about how it's going to make their lives easier their jobs easier Some are honest and saying "Yeah it might take away some jobs but it won't take away the jobs of people who adapt who learn and use AI in their current roles." Now I know in many roles I've had we've been understaffed We needed more people but we couldn't find them So I totally understand the appeal of having an AI buddy to augment your staff I just hope it doesn't go too far to where they realize suddenly they don't need me either But I will say this I was so encouraged being at this conference because what I saw was still a strong desire to learn networking People are still tons of people are still going for their CCNA their CCMP Everyone's excited about learning that next new thing and they're also excited about learning the basics IP addressing subnetting OPF EIGRP For the time being no matter how good AI gets we need people who know those protocols so we can tell AI when it's being dumb But reality check real change is coming and we need to be ready to adapt You need to adapt now If you haven't already started playing with AI you need to become very familiar with it I think the best thing you can do for yourself right now is just ask yourself how can AI help me do my current job better also get in community Talk with your fellow engineers and see what they're doing But also take comfort in this This is no different than anything we've ever encountered in it We've always had to learn and adapt to the new technologies that come up The people who don't adapt they do get left behind We had traditional telefan migrate to voiceover IP We saw the big change with network automation going from manually configuring a switch a switch a switch with CLI to configuring thousands all at once with automation One might say that AI is simply another iteration the next generation of automation And as far as what network engineers will be doing in the future I think that's probably it It will not be getting in the weeds as much as we are right now dealing with outages and and looking through logs It'll be how can I make the network better how can I automate more of the stuff we already have and in 5 years who knows you can't know Be optimistic Keep studying And from what we can see the world needs network engineers And we have a shortage and more AI is being built and we got to help power it Now I want to know what you think The questions I asked I would love to have those put in the comments below That's all I got I'll catch you guys next|### SUMMARY  <br>Presenter discusses the future of network engineering amidst

Like seriously,  <br>00:00:05.460 while my team and I were gone for threeweeks working on a top secret project  <br>00:00:08.670 for a pretty big YouTuber .  <br>00:00:10.710 I was just telling everyone how Nick waslazy and didn't finish his edit before  <br>00:00:14.460 the trip. Oh yeah, I only stayed up.  <br>00:00:17.010 Till one. I can't tell you about it.Don't even ask me. I'll tell you later.  <br>00:00:19.590 We needed a secure wicked fasts wayto access all of our stuff back home.  <br>00:00:23.550 Things like my big fat NASS remote desktopinto our editing machines and even my  <br>00:00:27.450 home lab to watch some flex. That'skind of what VPN is for, right? I mean,  <br>00:00:30.900 sure I could have set it up,but I didn't have the time.  <br>00:00:32.910 And the solution I found took about fiveminutes. And this one might shock you.  <br>00:00:36.270 VPN is not secure enough.  <br>00:00:37.600 Like when I give my twoknucklehead editors VP in access,  <br>00:00:40.800 they get access to everything serversthey shouldn't touch and they have a nasty  <br>00:00:44.160 habit of downloading free ramp.  <br>00:00:45.600 And if they already have malware and theycan blast it out to my entire network,  <br>00:00:49.050 what I need is a solution that givesthem access to only stuff they need.  <br>00:00:52.530 Nothing else.  <br>00:00:53.400 This is a little technique calledzero trust because I zero trust them.  <br>00:00:57.300 And listen, it's not just security aftersome research, VPN is kind of the uh,  <br>00:01:02.730 kind of the old way of doingthings and old as lane. I mean,  <br>00:01:07.565 have you seen the new stuff? It's [crazy.So](http://crazy.so/) what I found, it's kind of amazing.  <br>00:01:12.180 It's called Twin Gate. It's a zerotrust, remote access solution, buzzwords,  <br>00:01:15.630 blah blah blah. It basically means magicand it checks all my boxes. Watch this.  <br>00:01:20.010 In about five minutes,I deploy the Twin Gate,  <br>00:01:22.050 Docker container to my studionetwork, my home lab network,  <br>00:01:25.230 and even some private networksin the cloud. And just like that,  <br>00:01:28.200 I can connect from anywhere no matterwhere I go, no firewall config,  <br>00:01:31.950 no port forwarding and just works.  <br>00:01:33.660 And I don't care if you have CGNat or some weird I S P issues.  <br>00:01:37.830 It just does its thing kindof scary, easy actually.  <br>00:01:40.650 I have granular control on whateach person on my team can access.  <br>00:01:44.370 I can even say, you could only accessthis machine on this port and that's it.  <br>00:01:48.060 I can even control what they'reallowed to access stuff with.  <br>00:01:50.646 Like I could say they can use iPhonesbut no Android and that just makes sense.  <br>00:01:54.570 And if they're using Windows, I canrequire antivirus firewall settings.  <br>00:01:58.230 And if they don't have 'em, theycan't connect. And the crazy part,  <br>00:02:01.110 this is free, free for up to fiveusers and that covers my business.  <br>00:02:05.010 So let's get this set upin your network right now.  <br>00:02:07.560 I'll walk you throughevery step. It'll be quick,  <br>00:02:09.580 no longer than it taste tobrew a cup of coffee, trust me.  <br>00:02:12.150 And speaking of coffee,go ahead and do that.  <br>00:02:13.800 Grab you some because everythingin it requires coffee.  <br>00:02:19.440 Also,  <br>00:02:19.860 shout out to Twin Gate for helping mesolve my remote access problems and for  <br>00:02:23.100 sponsoring this video.  <br>00:02:24.210 Now I'm pretty picky about sponsorsand Twin Gate makes the cut. I love it.  <br>00:02:27.660 It's something I actuallyuse for everything and Iknow this will provide a ton  <br>00:02:31.290 of value to you. So let's get intoit. Actually, you know, real quick,  <br>00:02:34.350 have you hacked theYouTube algorithm today?  <br>00:02:36.390 Let's make sure you do hit thatlike button notification bell.  <br>00:02:38.220 Come and subscribe to everything. Yes,you gotta hack YouTube today ethically,  <br>00:02:43.260 of course. Now here's the setup.We have our network for me,  <br>00:02:45.990 it's my studio for you, it mightbe your home lab or your business.  <br>00:02:48.720 The goal here is to get my knuckleheadeditors access to what they need inside  <br>00:02:53.040 my network. So Income's TwinGate. Twin Gate has four parts.  <br>00:02:56.640 And don't let that scare you. You'llhave to worry about two of 'em.  <br>00:02:58.800 I'm telling you, this is not complex, atleast the setup. We've got our client,  <br>00:03:02.200 our connector, ourcontroller, and our relay.  <br>00:03:05.350 Right now we're gonna focus onthe connector and the controller.  <br>00:03:08.020 The controller is managed byTwin Gate. It's in their cloud,  <br>00:03:10.630 and it's what we'll use to sign up fora free account and configure all our  <br>00:03:13.395 stuff and who has accessto what the connector is,  <br>00:03:15.820 the docker container you'regonna put inside of your network,  <br>00:03:18.700 behind your firewall.  <br>00:03:19.810 And all you have to know about theconnector is that it connects stuff.  <br>00:03:22.750 That's all you have to know.  <br>00:03:23.560 I think that's the only twosteps we have to worry about.  <br>00:03:25.660 Set up an account on TwinGate, which is the controller,  <br>00:03:28.270 and then deploy the connectorinside our network. Done.  <br>00:03:32.140 Now that does beg the question, whatdo we need for this? Only two things.  <br>00:03:35.800 First, you'll need something to put thatDocker container on some type of Lennox  <br>00:03:40.510 server. This could be your nas, anold laptop, even a raspberry pie,  <br>00:03:44.110 which is what I'm goingto demo on right now.  <br>00:03:46.000 And the second thing you shouldalready have in your hand right now,  <br>00:03:48.430 a cup of coffee. Like I said, everythingin it requires coffee. Say it with me,  <br>00:03:52.240 I'm not gonna do it again, butseriously, get some coffee.  <br>00:03:54.430 First step is the controller. So headout to twin [gates.com](http://gates.com/). That's simple.  <br>00:03:58.330 That's it. It's time toditch your vpn. Dang right.  <br>00:04:00.550 And right here in the middle, we'regonna click on try Twin Gate for free.  <br>00:04:03.520 Try twin gate, try twin gates. Say that10 times fast. That's ridiculously hard.  <br>00:04:07.000 Click it here. Pick your poison.What do you wanna log in with?  <br>00:04:09.940 I'm gonna log in with GitHub,click on that authorize twin gate.  <br>00:04:13.060 And here we have some details.Now if you're like, okay,  <br>00:04:15.760 I'm setting this up for my home lab, Idon't have a company name, don't worry,  <br>00:04:18.910 they're gonna give you a business trialfor 14 days, no credit card, whatever.  <br>00:04:22.000 You're gonna have that starter plan forfree forever. So make up a company name.  <br>00:04:25.600 I'm gonna name my own hack, well technumber of employees under a hundred.  <br>00:04:29.350 Let's finish it up. Skip allthis, blah, blah, blah. No,  <br>00:04:32.050 I don't need technical support. I'm good.I can run C commands, I promise I can.  <br>00:04:35.260 And then choose your url. I'llleave it at Hack Wall Tech.  <br>00:04:37.750 Good to go create that network. So atthis point you have a twin Gate account,  <br>00:04:41.380 you have a controller. Now all wehave to do is configure a few things.  <br>00:04:44.590 There are two thingswe're gonna start with,  <br>00:04:46.000 and it's actually tellingyou right here at step one,  <br>00:04:48.070 the first thing we'll setup is your remote network,  <br>00:04:49.490 which will be your home lab,studio, business, whatever.  <br>00:04:52.810 And once we defined it here,  <br>00:04:53.980 we can actually deploy ourconnector to connect everything up.  <br>00:04:57.790 The second thing will configureresources. By default,  <br>00:05:00.370 you can't access anything.  <br>00:05:01.480 So you have to specifically explicitlydefine what you are allowed to access in  <br>00:05:06.370 your network. I love that. Zerotrust. All right, let's go.  <br>00:05:09.340 Let's knock out the network first.  <br>00:05:10.990 You'll notice right down here we have adda remote network. Let's click on that.  <br>00:05:15.100 Choose your location. Noticeyou have some options.  <br>00:05:17.560 What I care about right now ison-premise, and I'll name it Hack well  <br>00:05:23.980 hq, add Remote Network. Man, that wasso hard, right? , that was easy.  <br>00:05:27.240 And we're almost done actually. Now todeploy our connector inside the network.  <br>00:05:31.240 Notice they have two connectorsover here, but they're not deployed.  <br>00:05:34.810 And notice they do want you to deploytwo, you can deploy one, that's fine.  <br>00:05:38.230 But if you want redundancy and highavailability, you can deploy two.  <br>00:05:41.290 But we'll start with one, butwhich one to pick? Impetuous,  <br>00:05:44.290 jagar or Optimal Vulture. Ican pronounce this better.  <br>00:05:48.130 I'm gonna go with that one.  <br>00:05:48.910 So we'll click on deploy connector andwe'll choose how we're going to deploy  <br>00:05:51.910 this. Now, I talked about this Docker,  <br>00:05:54.070 docker's so easy we're gonna go withthat, but you do have options. Step,  <br>00:05:57.350 we're gonna generate ourtokens. What are those?  <br>00:05:59.930 We'll cover more about thathere in a bit. In fact,  <br>00:06:01.880 I'm gonna go kind of nerdy on you andexplain the magic of how this works.  <br>00:06:05.540 But let's set this up. First. We'llgo ahead and generate our tokens.  <br>00:06:08.120 Click on generate tokens, and it willask you to authenticate yourself again,  <br>00:06:11.480 which is great security.  <br>00:06:13.040 And you'll notice you do have youraccess and refresh tokens generated.  <br>00:06:16.280 And then we'll scrollon down to step four.  <br>00:06:18.710 And all we have to do here is copy andpaste this Docker run command and we're  <br>00:06:22.585 good to go. So I'll pause here for asecond. Let's get logged into the device.  <br>00:06:25.610 We're going to install our twin gateconnector on. For me it's a raspberry pie.  <br>00:06:29.810 So here in Windows I'm gonna launch myterminal and I'll ssh into my raspberry  <br>00:06:33.320 pie. And before we copyand paste our command,  <br>00:06:35.660 let's just make sure we have Dockerinstalled, and that's super easy. First,  <br>00:06:38.630 we'll update our repositories,pseudo p t update,  <br>00:06:41.870 and then we'll install Dockerpseudo apt install [docker.io](http://docker.io/)  <br>00:06:46.760 dash y. Mine is already installed,but it should go pretty quick for you.  <br>00:06:49.910 And now literally all wehave to do is copy and paste.  <br>00:06:53.330 So we'll get back to our browserhere, click the copy command,  <br>00:06:56.000 go back to our terminal and paste. Andyou may have to run this as pseudo.  <br>00:06:59.840 I wanna do a control A,  <br>00:07:01.250 run it as pseudo at the beginning andthen hit enter and let the party start.  <br>00:07:05.600 Who, ah, I love seeing this quickcoffee break while the show's happening.  <br>00:07:08.870 Just enjoy the show.  <br>00:07:12.770 And that was it. So real quickwhile we're here on the terminal,  <br>00:07:16.220 before we leave, let's type inpseudo docker PS to make sure it's,  <br>00:07:20.780 it's in there running. Andthere it is, it's running.  <br>00:07:22.670 And now if we get back to ourtwinge controller, aka [twinge.com](http://twinge.com/),  <br>00:07:27.290 there it is. Our connection status,the optimal vulture is connected.  <br>00:07:31.400 Now let's add some resources. Let'sget back to our network up here.  <br>00:07:34.790 Click on that. And we don'treally need this right now.  <br>00:07:36.710 So let's just click on dismiss.  <br>00:07:38.030 And right here you'll seean add resource button.  <br>00:07:40.250 Let's click on that Add resource.  <br>00:07:41.840 The first thing we'll dois choose a remote network.  <br>00:07:43.760 I'm gonna pick Hack well hq. And yes,  <br>00:07:45.830 that does mean you can havemore than one remote network.  <br>00:07:47.740 So add your parents' house at grandma'shouse, your friend's house, whatever.  <br>00:07:51.080 You can do that. Then we'll specify ourhost. Now we can use DNS or IP address.  <br>00:07:55.160 And this DNS thing, by the way, is crazy.  <br>00:07:57.740 We'll cover that here in a bit for now.  <br>00:07:59.270 We'll focus on IP addressto keep things simple.  <br>00:08:01.190 So choose cider label what you'resetting up. I'm gonna access my nas.  <br>00:08:04.220 First big fat nas. Then the IP address.  <br>00:08:08.780 Keep in mind, this will beyour private IP address aside,  <br>00:08:11.300 your home network or yourbusiness network, whatever it is.  <br>00:08:14.120 Then also notice we have an alias option.  <br>00:08:16.430 We'll cover that when we talk about dns.But again, this whole thing is insane.  <br>00:08:20.120 It's magic. I can't wait to tellyou that though. But let, let's,  <br>00:08:22.310 let's keep moving forward. Nextwe have protocol restrictions.  <br>00:08:24.740 And what I wanna do is have myeditors only access my NASS on Port  <br>00:08:29.240 5,000, which is the gooey. So Iclick on protocol restrictions.  <br>00:08:33.169 Right now everything'sallowed, may not want that.  <br>00:08:35.539 So we'll say TCP restrict and we'llspecify the ports. I'll say 5,000.  <br>00:08:40.220 And then I'll block UDP andblock I C M P. So at this point,  <br>00:08:44.930 only port 5,000 TCP is allowed.That's all we care about right now.  <br>00:08:49.100 I'm gonna click on ad resource.And then as soon as you do that,  <br>00:08:51.475 you can choose who has access to thisresource for now we have one group.  <br>00:08:55.050 That's everyone. I'll go ahead and addthat. We can change that at any time.  <br>00:08:58.950 And I'll click on add one [group.So](http://group.so/) right now we have a resource.  <br>00:09:01.800 If I hover over this guy right here,  <br>00:09:03.540 it'll tell me exactly what'sallowed TCP 5,000. That's it.  <br>00:09:06.660 So what do you say we tested out? Whichby the way, you just set up Twin Gate,  <br>00:09:09.990 like that was it. That's all it took.Now we have to worry about is the client.  <br>00:09:13.290 The third piece,  <br>00:09:14.670 which is just installing an appand logging in super hard .  <br>00:09:18.480 Let's try that right now. Allright, I got my laptop here.  <br>00:09:20.670 I wanna download the Twin Gate clientby heading out to twin [gate.com/download](http://gate.com/download)  <br>00:09:25.050 cuz I'm using Windows. I'llclick on download for Windows.  <br>00:09:27.450 They have an app for everything. Mac, goWest, iPhone, Android, whatever. It's,  <br>00:09:30.630 I'll open the file and install thesucker and click on finish. Ugh.  <br>00:09:34.440 And a restart. I hate restartingthis stuff. One moment. Now,  <br>00:09:37.020 before I configure TwinGate, like any good magician,  <br>00:09:39.480 let me show you that I can'taccess my stuff. First.  <br>00:09:42.150 I want to make sure I'm connectedto my 5G connection on my phone.  <br>00:09:45.395 Now let's try and access my NASSfour, 5,000. It's not looking good.  <br>00:09:49.080 Can't reach the page. Nowlet's sign into twinge.  <br>00:09:51.270 I'll connect to Hack Well Tech, that'swhen I named it, right? Yeah, I think so.  <br>00:09:55.140 I'll join that network, sign in withmy GitHub and we should be good to go.  <br>00:09:59.580 I'm gonna close my browser windowreal quick. It already happened.  <br>00:10:02.610 Look at that 5,000. I'm going over it,man. Look at my tray right now. Yes,  <br>00:10:07.350 I can see I'm connected.Oh, that's so stinking cool.  <br>00:10:09.990 I love this but I shouldn't be ableto ping anything. Let's see. Yeah,  <br>00:10:13.800 nothing campaign it. We disabledIC m p, let's try S ssh. Nothing.  <br>00:10:17.880 Let me nail it real quick.Actually, I wanna test this.  <br>00:10:19.890 Now we're rolling then I'm gonnajust edit it real quick and add  <br>00:10:24.690 port 22. Let's see what happens.Confirm changes. Let's try it now. Oh,  <br>00:10:29.280 took a minute, but I'm in justlike that. How cool is that?  <br>00:10:32.490 Now at this point you've configuredTwin Gate, like it works, it's amazing.  <br>00:10:35.670 But there's more we can do. There'sDNS based routing, device security,  <br>00:10:39.270 and we're gonna walk through all thathere in a moment. But if you're like me,  <br>00:10:42.090 kind of a nerd, you can't just walkaway from this video thinking, okay,  <br>00:10:45.060 I've got the fastest, most secureway to connect to my stuff.  <br>00:10:47.670 But you have to know how it works,right? Like how is this thing working?  <br>00:10:50.760 Let's talk about that Nowlet's get a bit nerdy.  <br>00:10:52.980 Let's pop the hood on thisthing and see what's going on.  <br>00:10:54.960 What's the magic that's makingall this tick? And it's,  <br>00:10:57.120 it's actually really cool. Ican't wait to show you now.  <br>00:10:58.980 I'll start with this Twin gate. It's,it's not a p n, it's not .  <br>00:11:02.460 Let me explain Now, the goal forTwin Gate is this right here,  <br>00:11:05.160 a secure end-to-end TLS tunnel. It'speer-to-peer between the client,  <br>00:11:09.330 which is you or your family oryour employees, friends, whatever,  <br>00:11:12.390 and the connector inside yournetwork. But how does this happen?  <br>00:11:15.450 Especially with networksthat don't play nice.  <br>00:11:17.250 They have like CG Nat Dynamic IP addressesand all the craziness our ISPs put us  <br>00:11:21.425 through. Because trust me, if youhave those networks, this thing just,  <br>00:11:24.120 it just works. But how,  <br>00:11:25.950 let's start with the connectorcuz he does most of the work.  <br>00:11:28.110 The connector is this guy.  <br>00:11:29.040 Let's talk about how theconnector was born real quick.  <br>00:11:30.870 So you may recall in our controller here,  <br>00:11:32.700 we deploy the connector inside thecontroller, the optimal vulture.  <br>00:11:35.790 When we did that, we had to generatea couple of tokens like, like this.  <br>00:11:39.030 If I try to deploy anotherconnector, I'll say generate tokens,  <br>00:11:41.640 have to authenticateagain. And there they are.  <br>00:11:43.470 I point this out because this isa key part of Twin Gate security.  <br>00:11:47.010 They use more tokens than Chuck E Cheeseand that's how they authenticate with  <br>00:11:49.950 each other.  <br>00:11:50.400 So when we deploy this docker runcommand baked in with these Chucky cheese  <br>00:11:54.460 tokens and when the twin Gateconnector came up in our network,  <br>00:11:57.280 he talked to the controller and said,Hey, here I am. Here's my tokens.  <br>00:12:00.460 And they, they were friendsnow cuz he knew who he was.  <br>00:12:02.890 So he gives him thetokens and then exchange.  <br>00:12:04.660 The controller tells a connectoreverything he needs to know.  <br>00:12:07.420 Two really important thingswe're gonna focus on right now.  <br>00:12:09.570 First is an ACL and access control list.  <br>00:12:12.460 This tells the connector who'sallowed to come into the network.  <br>00:12:14.830 It's a list of allowed devices andwhat they're allowed to access.  <br>00:12:17.320 We define that. Remember wedid that inside the controller.  <br>00:12:19.660 So the controller's givingthe connector that list,  <br>00:12:21.940 he's also telling him about Mr. Relay.  <br>00:12:24.370 Remember Twin Gate has four componentsand this is the fourth one we have not  <br>00:12:27.490 talked about yet. So thecontroller says, Hey,  <br>00:12:28.936 here's a few relays that youcan connect to. Now the relays,  <br>00:12:32.170 I'll tell you more about whatthose are here in a moment.  <br>00:12:33.790 Much like the controller,  <br>00:12:34.630 they're hosted inside Twin Gates networkso you don't have to worry about it.  <br>00:12:37.870 I'll put the relaysright here in my beard.  <br>00:12:40.150 Now the relay's job is simple butsuper important. He's the matchmaker.  <br>00:12:43.960 He helps the client,  <br>00:12:45.010 my knucklehead video editors andthe connector discovery each other,  <br>00:12:48.340 find out how to meet. He'sthe guy that does that.  <br>00:12:50.710 The kind of play in love is blind rightnow they're talking behind a wall.  <br>00:12:53.530 Let's take down that wall.  <br>00:12:57.040 Just a hug.  <br>00:12:58.140 Now here's how the clientand the connector connect.  <br>00:13:00.670 The first thing that'll happenis the connector will connect.  <br>00:13:03.430 He's such a connector.  <br>00:13:04.720 He'll connect with a relay and he guesseswhat he uses to authenticate a  <br>00:13:08.620 token. It's actually a token from thecontroller to say, Hey, I know this guy,  <br>00:13:13.360 we both know him. We're friends, we'regood. Not on the flip side, the client,  <br>00:13:17.290 it's doing the same thing.  <br>00:13:18.460 It did the whole token thing of thecontroller when it authenticated and it  <br>00:13:21.940 connects to a relay.  <br>00:13:23.200 So now that the client and theconnector are talking to the relay,  <br>00:13:25.810 the relay can now introducethem. He's the matchmaker,  <br>00:13:28.330 but he's doing more than you might thinkcuz there's a pretty big problem he's  <br>00:13:31.065 solving right now. And thisis why we even need a relay.  <br>00:13:33.550 The problem is that the devices in yournetwork are nestled safely behind a  <br>00:13:36.940 firewall or a router and they're somewhatkind of sheltered from the internet.  <br>00:13:40.540 The internet can't touch them. Andthat's by design. That's a good thing.  <br>00:13:42.796 Your devices don't evenhave a public IP address,  <br>00:13:45.160 which is what they need to talkto everyone on the internet.  <br>00:13:47.710 Usually your router is the one that hasthe public IP address and he allows the  <br>00:13:51.645 devices on your network. So thinkyou're nas, your twin gate connector,  <br>00:13:56.050 your editing PCs.  <br>00:13:57.190 He allows those devices to use thepublic IP whenever they want to talk to  <br>00:14:01.090 people. This is a magical technologycalled nat or network address translation.  <br>00:14:05.290 So what this means is thatyour computer, for example,  <br>00:14:07.240 has no problem talking to the internetwhen it tries to go out and talk to a  <br>00:14:10.780 website. The router will letit use its public IP address.  <br>00:14:14.320 It'll actually give it alittle identifier, a port,  <br>00:14:16.870 let's say 5 1 7 90 with that identifierthat port your computer can talk to  <br>00:14:21.880 any website it wants. It works great.  <br>00:14:23.530 And when the website wants to send aphoto back or a meme or whatever you're  <br>00:14:26.530 doing, it knows that this camefrom 1 5, 9, 7 4, 1, 2, 2, 1 1 3,  <br>00:14:31.540 port 51, 7, 9, 0.  <br>00:14:33.880 So when it talks back to yourcomputer and it gets to your router,  <br>00:14:37.570 your router goes, oh, this is 4507 90. When they get that right to 'em.  <br>00:14:41.740 Now Nat and these randomly assigned portsare great for your computer to connect  <br>00:14:45.370 to stuff on the internet,but not great at all.  <br>00:14:47.710 for things to connect back to it.  <br>00:14:49.810 So the Twin Gate client can'tstart talking to your computer.  <br>00:14:52.790 There's no door open there. Andthat's where the relays come in.  <br>00:14:55.430 The relay does something really cleverand it's so cool when you really think  <br>00:14:58.460 about it.  <br>00:14:58.760 So you know the example I gave you ofyour computer connecting to a website and  <br>00:15:02.300 using a randomly assigned port using that.  <br>00:15:04.400 It uses that to build thatpeer-to-peer connection. So watch this,  <br>00:15:07.646 your connector inside your network,it's connected to the relay, right?  <br>00:15:11.300 We've got a connection,  <br>00:15:12.230 which means he's gonna have a public IPand a randomly assigned port from Nat  <br>00:15:16.765 from your router.  <br>00:15:17.570 So IP and port and the relay knowsthat because he has that connection.  <br>00:15:21.230 On the other side of things,you using the Twin Gate client,  <br>00:15:24.410 you're probably using Nat toowifi at Starbucks airport,  <br>00:15:27.350 some secret YouTuberstudio, whatever it is.  <br>00:15:29.750 So you get your public IP and theyrandomly assign port and the client has a  <br>00:15:33.500 connection with the relay. Soright at this moment, look at this,  <br>00:15:36.530 the relay has a connection withthe connector and the client,  <br>00:15:39.710 he knows their public IP addresses andhe knows the port that Nats using to  <br>00:15:43.490 reach back to them. So the relay goes,lemme just tell them where they are.  <br>00:15:48.110 Let me,  <br>00:15:48.290 let me tell both these guys where theyare so they can talk to each other.  <br>00:15:51.080 And that's exactly what happens.The relay tells the client, Hey,  <br>00:15:54.230 if you want to talk to the connector,here's his IP address in port.  <br>00:15:57.140 And he tells the connector, Hey,if you wanna talk to the client,  <br>00:15:59.330 here's his IP address in port. Andwith that magic information supplied,  <br>00:16:03.830 bam, we get a connection.  <br>00:16:05.570 They know how to find each other ina secure end-to-end TLS tunnel is  <br>00:16:10.010 established. Now thismagic does have a name,  <br>00:16:12.440 it's called Nat Traversal because we'retraversing all these NAT servers to make  <br>00:16:17.305 a direct connection,  <br>00:16:18.140 which is pretty hard to do when thingsare kind of hidden behind random ports.  <br>00:16:21.640 That's why we need a server like a relay.  <br>00:16:24.740 This is actually operatingas a stun server.  <br>00:16:26.870 Stun does this kind of stuff and itfacilitates those connections. Whoa,  <br>00:16:30.710 why is there a virus onthis pc? Let me remove that,  <br>00:16:33.680 how embarrassing I left that there.  <br>00:16:35.990 Now a couple of things about howthis connection business works.  <br>00:16:39.320 A couple of highlights. Thisthing is secure. Like I said,  <br>00:16:42.320 twin Gate is using moretokens than Chuck E. Cheese.  <br>00:16:44.510 Every single interaction wasauthenticated with a token.  <br>00:16:47.900 This TLS tunnel is usingpenned certificates,  <br>00:16:50.630 which makes it darn near impossibleto do a man in the middle attack.  <br>00:16:53.540 And honestly, I'm not doing it justice.  <br>00:16:55.070 If you wanna dive deeper into how likeall the authentication and tokenizing  <br>00:16:58.640 stuff is working, I've gottadocument below, check it out.  <br>00:17:01.640 The second thing is that this isnot a VPN n I mentioned it before.  <br>00:17:05.240 So you're probably like, wellChuck, if it's not vpn, what is it?  <br>00:17:07.460 It's a proxy actually.  <br>00:17:08.630 It's a super secure private proxy andspecifically the connector inside your  <br>00:17:12.770 network is operating it as a proxy.  <br>00:17:15.230 They work by terminatingnetwork connections andthey'll do some fancy stuff for  <br>00:17:18.530 that traffic. They'llmanipulate it, validate it,  <br>00:17:20.599 and forward the traffic on to itscorrect destination. It's very,  <br>00:17:23.720 very programmable and and custom. Thethird thing I want you to know is, uh,  <br>00:17:27.380 this sucker's quick and no,  <br>00:17:29.120 I didn't forget how to spell Quick is a new protocol.  <br>00:17:32.060 If you haven't heard of this.  <br>00:17:32.950 It's a transport layer protocol forall your network uh, nerds out there.  <br>00:17:36.230 It's built on top of U udp and it'sdesigned to be faster and more efficient  <br>00:17:40.760 than tcp, which is likewait, you're building on topof UDP to beat TCP ?  <br>00:17:45.500 Sure, but that's what it does. Now,quick is taking the internet by storm.  <br>00:17:49.200 You're probably already using it rightnow if you did a wire shark capture.  <br>00:17:51.540 But here's some of the maindifferences that makes it amazing.  <br>00:17:54.390 One of them is multiplexing.Multiplexing is a big one.  <br>00:17:57.390 You can send multiple streams of dataover one connection versus this rush hour  <br>00:18:01.380 freeway up here that's tcp.  <br>00:18:03.360 And what this means for Twin Gate andwhy it's so quick to make connections is  <br>00:18:06.990 that it can make a connection offand everything in one round trip.  <br>00:18:11.100 Whereas with TCP it might be a bunchof back and forth negotiations and  <br>00:18:15.870 time and remitted packetsand all kinds of stuff.  <br>00:18:18.240 And one really cool thing that quickdoes, and this is kind of mind blowing,  <br>00:18:22.080 but it does client sideroaming or it facilitates that.  <br>00:18:24.690 So let's say you as a client are tryingto remain connected to a remote desktop  <br>00:18:28.080 session or you're watching a movie onPlex and you go from wifi in your house to  <br>00:18:31.560 maybe you're in the car on 5g.  <br>00:18:33.660 Normally that switch and connectionrequires a disconnect and reconnect quick  <br>00:18:37.775 just keeps connection up. Theconnection survives. It's kind of crazy.  <br>00:18:41.280 And then one more thing to note backhaul with traditional V P N when you  <br>00:18:44.700 connect,  <br>00:18:45.300 it normally means every bit of trafficyou're generating whatever website you go  <br>00:18:48.990 to, whether it's on your privatenetwork or on the internet,  <br>00:18:52.230 it's gonna go through that VPN N device.  <br>00:18:55.200 Literally everything you're doingis going through the VPN N device.  <br>00:18:57.810 That's bad for a varietyof reasons. First of all,  <br>00:18:59.375 you may not want to have everythingyou're doing be seen by that VPN N device.  <br>00:19:02.220 All you wanted was accessto some resources. Second,  <br>00:19:04.950 as an IT person is a person tryingto administer a VPN gateway, dude,  <br>00:19:08.310 that's a lot of extra traffic thatyou're having to grow your firewall for.  <br>00:19:12.030 It's really inefficient.  <br>00:19:13.020 But with Twin Gate it does a thingcalled Split tunnel by default,  <br>00:19:16.020 which means that only traffic destinedfor the resources you want access,  <br>00:19:20.430 go through a twin gate, everythingelse, Facebook, YouTube, it goes out.  <br>00:19:23.825 Your standard internet gatewaydoesn't touch twin gay.  <br>00:19:26.310 So only the traffic that needs to goacross those security t l s tunnels,  <br>00:19:30.870 those end-to-end tunnels,  <br>00:19:32.490 the only traffic that goes across thoseis traffic that's supposed to for those  <br>00:19:35.430 resources. Now, yes, you can configureSplit Tunnel with a lot of V P N.  <br>00:19:39.270 I've done it. It's not easy. Twin Gate is built in by default.  <br>00:19:43.590 You don't have to even think aboutit. It just works like that. Okay,  <br>00:19:45.750 we popped the hood, wesaw some nerdy stuff.  <br>00:19:47.760 Now time to configure some nerdy thingsstarting with something really cool.  <br>00:19:51.540 Device security. Now back here in ourtwin gate controller, aka twin [gate.com](http://gate.com/),  <br>00:19:55.830 let's do a few things real quick. First,  <br>00:19:57.570 we're actually gonna add to ourteam by clicking on team up here,  <br>00:20:00.330 adding to your team is real easy. Ifyou wanna add family, friends, whatever,  <br>00:20:03.420 I'll click on add user, I'll addmyself to this team, send invite email.  <br>00:20:07.710 And what I'll also do is configurea group. So I'll click on groups,  <br>00:20:10.440 add a group and say Beards,that's it. Add group.  <br>00:20:13.590 And then I'll jump into that group, clickon users and add myself to that group.  <br>00:20:16.620 Now here I'm connecting on myphone and you can see I'm on 5g.  <br>00:20:19.980 Now I'm connecting through justfine, everything's loading.  <br>00:20:21.930 But now let's play with device security.  <br>00:20:23.520 So at the top I'll click ondevices and first of all,  <br>00:20:25.590 it's pretty cool that you cansee every device connected,  <br>00:20:27.870 but what we care about is securityright here. Let's click on that here.  <br>00:20:30.930 We can configure security based onminimum OS requirements. So for example,  <br>00:20:35.220 I may not want iOS allowed at all.  <br>00:20:38.370 So I can go in here and say Block [iOS.So](http://ios.so/) now when I try to log into Twin Gate,  <br>00:20:43.350 I've got iOS blocked, I can'teven authenticate, I can't get in.  <br>00:20:46.740 So you block an entire OS or just enforcegood policies like hey, screen lock,  <br>00:20:51.340 let's make sure we have screen lockand maybe like biometric configuration.  <br>00:20:54.520 So touch ID if you still have that faceid, things like that. Heck yeah, Linux,  <br>00:20:58.720 HD encryption, firewall, windows,goodness gracious, enable the whole thing.  <br>00:21:02.920 So that's already super powerful. Also,  <br>00:21:04.630 you'll see we have the optionto create a trusted profile.  <br>00:21:07.060 Let me show you what thatis. The click on create.  <br>00:21:09.010 Let's say we'll do one for Windows.  <br>00:21:10.360 Notice here we have theoption to integrate with thirdparty endpoint protection  <br>00:21:14.320 stuff, CrowdStrike, Intune, Sentinel One.  <br>00:21:16.540 And you can rely on those super advancedprograms to tell you if those devices  <br>00:21:19.930 are safe to connect. And ifthey're not trusted by those,  <br>00:21:22.190 then they're not trusted byTwin Gates. That's pretty cool.  <br>00:21:26.020 Now we also have policieswhere you can define policies.  <br>00:21:28.960 The main thing I want you to see inpolicies is the MFA not required.  <br>00:21:31.935 Over here you can just straight offthe bat make sure that MFA multifactor  <br>00:21:35.740 authentication is required.  <br>00:21:37.450 And then going into policies youcan set further requirements.  <br>00:21:40.300 Like if you set the defaultpolicy for device security,  <br>00:21:43.030 you can manage that to say,Hey, only trusted devices,  <br>00:21:45.555 meaning they have to be trustedby CrowdStrike in TuneIn all one.  <br>00:21:49.870 Or you can leave it at any deviceas long as they meet device security  <br>00:21:52.330 requirements, the minimumOS requirements you've set.  <br>00:21:54.580 Now I wanna move on to something prettyfun and it's how Twin Gate handles and  <br>00:21:58.270 treats dns. It's kind of crazy.  <br>00:22:00.380 So let's get back up tothe network tab over here.  <br>00:22:02.830 I don't need to switch to my pen.Ah, there we go. We'll go to network.  <br>00:22:05.860 And so far we've added a resourceby specifying the IP address.  <br>00:22:09.160 Like here's the IP Twin Gatewill take care of the rest.  <br>00:22:12.010 But we also saw how we could use DNS adomain name. Let's try it out real quick.  <br>00:22:15.940 So here in my network I'vegot a Prox Box server.  <br>00:22:19.330 It's great for hosting virtual machines.  <br>00:22:21.010 You can find it via DNS atprox dot hogwarts dot local.  <br>00:22:25.810 Now keeping in mind, thisis via my local DNS server.  <br>00:22:28.840 So here in my studio and maybe inyour network or your business network,  <br>00:22:32.290 you have a DNS [server.So](http://server.so/) when I ping prox max,  <br>00:22:36.010 it replies to the IP address becausemy private DNS server response,  <br>00:22:39.610 this is not accessibleon the big wild internet.  <br>00:22:42.280 Now how Twin Gate will useyour DNS servers crazy.  <br>00:22:44.950 But let's go ahead and add it real quick.  <br>00:22:46.120 So I'm gonna have my newemployee I created, which was me.  <br>00:22:48.940 I think I'm gonna have me access Proxbox. So we'll click on ad resource,  <br>00:22:53.980 we'll choose a remote network. We'llonly have one right now. We'll do dns,  <br>00:22:56.500 we'll label it. And thenI'll put in the DNS address,  <br>00:22:58.630 which is proxima dot hogwarts dot local.  <br>00:23:01.930 Notice I'm not telling it what IPaddress that it is or anything like that.  <br>00:23:06.040 I'm just saying the DNS address,the domain name for protocol.  <br>00:23:08.830 I'll allow everything just fortesting. And then I'll say only beards.  <br>00:23:12.670 Only beards can use this. So I haveone group, which is just gonna be me.  <br>00:23:16.180 Now first let's see if it worksbecause I don't wanna lie to you.  <br>00:23:18.700 I wanna get logged back in. I got loggedout. Oh I forgot I enforced mfa. Ugh,  <br>00:23:23.950 I'm gonna turn it off real quick. ,I don't feel like doing it right now.  <br>00:23:27.220 That's just bad security. Okay, cool.  <br>00:23:28.960 So I see Product Moss hereand currently I'm on 5g,  <br>00:23:31.300 so I'm not on my home network.  <br>00:23:32.860 I'm gonna authenticate and then copythe address and try to go to it.  <br>00:23:36.070 I'll do https, colon wwa,  <br>00:23:38.560 paste it in there and go to pour 8,006for Prox Max proceed. And there we go.  <br>00:23:43.510 Just like that. Lemme show youhow that, here's my network,  <br>00:23:46.250 here's my Prox MO server andhere's my uh, DNS server,  <br>00:23:50.090 which is actually running on a raspberrypie. It's agar. I highly recommend it.  <br>00:23:53.690 What's crazy is that the TwinGate connector, he does a lot,  <br>00:23:57.080 but what he also doesbeyond everything else,  <br>00:23:59.450 well not beyond just also isthat he proxies DNS request.  <br>00:24:04.160 He's a DNS proxy. Andhere's what that means.  <br>00:24:06.290 So me over here on my Twin Gateclient, I got Twin Gate on my phone.  <br>00:24:09.710 There's something kind of weird going onwith your Twin Gate client and by weird  <br>00:24:12.685 I mean awesome. This is the only timeI'll mention it using VPN by the way,  <br>00:24:16.730 it actually uses a VPN connection onyour phone and whatever device you're  <br>00:24:20.810 using, it's a VPNconnection to local host.  <br>00:24:24.500 So 1 2 7 0 0 1,  <br>00:24:28.250 which we all know that local host onetwo seven zero zero one is itself.  <br>00:24:31.940 It's the phone itself.  <br>00:24:32.990 It's making a VPN connection back toitself that has one purpose of Twin Gate.  <br>00:24:37.040 It's listening and waiting for attemptsto connect to resources and it's a acl.  <br>00:24:41.300 So it has a list of things that itknows I'm allowed to connect to,  <br>00:24:44.240 blah blah blah blah blah. One ofthose things being proxim max,  <br>00:24:46.970 it waits and listens and it goes,oh, oh, that's for me Proxim Max.  <br>00:24:50.210 It watches everything. And when it seesit's something meant for Twin Gate,  <br>00:24:53.900 it'll take it and send it to the TwinGate connector over its secure TLS Tunnel.  <br>00:24:57.470 Now in the case of dns, what it'll do is,  <br>00:24:59.330 you know we configured a resourcethat's prox box dot hogwarts dot  <br>00:25:03.920 local. When it sees proxbox dot hogwarts dot local,  <br>00:25:06.800 it's like okay that's in my list.  <br>00:25:08.600 It will then send this over our secureTLS connection TLS Tunnel to the Twin  <br>00:25:12.920 Gate connector and the connector willresolve that DNS request with its own  <br>00:25:16.880 configured DNS [server.So](http://server.so/) think about that.  <br>00:25:18.830 My twin gate connector that'ssitting inside my network,  <br>00:25:21.110 I gave it it's DNS server, whichis my private DNS server here.  <br>00:25:24.050 That's what it's using to resolve anyof those domain names I configure inside  <br>00:25:28.310 Twin Gate. That's pretty cool.  <br>00:25:29.390 And what that empowers me to do is DNSbase routing to different networks,  <br>00:25:33.950 which I don't think any othersolution does. It's kind of crazy.  <br>00:25:37.730 Now that's cool, but what if you don'thave a DNS server in your house? Well,  <br>00:25:40.820 twin Gate has a new feature calledAlias sis. Let's try it out real quick.  <br>00:25:44.300 Let's add another resource. Iwanna connect to my Plex server.  <br>00:25:46.490 So remote network hack WorldTech,I'll do a an IP address, the alias,  <br>00:25:49.670 I can make it whatever I want itto be. Plex dot beards dot awesome.  <br>00:25:53.720 I don't know that's what it's gonna be.  <br>00:25:54.950 I will only allow port 32,400 for Plex and that's it.  <br>00:25:59.330 I'll give me access Beards ofcourse. And that's the Plex server.  <br>00:26:03.170 Let's see if that alias works.If this works be kind of crazy,  <br>00:26:06.530 let's go to plex dot, beards dot awesome.  <br>00:26:10.460 Port 3 2 400. Is it working?Seems to be working.  <br>00:26:15.890 It worked. How cool is that?  <br>00:26:17.960 Now a couple of things incase you didn't notice this,  <br>00:26:20.330 you don't have to addjust individual resources.  <br>00:26:22.640 If you wanted to add a oneresource and make that a wild card,  <br>00:26:25.850 so either an IP address, saylike my network, do a slash 24,  <br>00:26:30.630 make that one resource and youget access to your entire network.  <br>00:26:33.560 Same goes for dns, which is prettystinking cool. Just do a wild card.  <br>00:26:36.890 I use this heavily by the way. And it'sso stinking cool. Makes things easy.  <br>00:26:40.070 At least for me.  <br>00:26:40.790 Like I only give myself access tothis and restrict everyone else.  <br>00:26:44.400 It just makes sense. Nowbecause this video is so long,  <br>00:26:46.740 I'm not gonna demo these last few things,  <br>00:26:48.210 but I just wanna touch on them real quickbecause they're so powerful and I do  <br>00:26:50.970 use them. If I go overto my team, we the top,  <br>00:26:54.600 I've got users groups and then there'sone thing I haven't talked about.  <br>00:26:57.270 And that's services. What is that?Click on that. Nothing there.  <br>00:27:01.350 What this is though, it's so cool.  <br>00:27:03.750 You've seen how we can install a TwinGate cloud on your phone, laptop,  <br>00:27:07.080 whatever. But they also haveheadless clients. They got no heads,  <br>00:27:11.550 which means you can install them on aLinux server with one command and they  <br>00:27:15.845 just work and it's so cool. SoI did this with um, uptime Kuma.  <br>00:27:21.030 So I had a LE server in the cloud.  <br>00:27:23.190 I installed Uptime Kuma on that and Iinstalled the Twin Gate headless client on  <br>00:27:26.760 there. And with that it was able tomonitor everything in my private network.  <br>00:27:31.830 And actually I lied. It wasn't myprivate network that was monitoring,  <br>00:27:34.530 I was actually doing the top secretYouTube thing I talked to you about.  <br>00:27:37.560 I was using this exact setupto monitor a couple hun. Uh,  <br>00:27:41.760 I can't tell you it was a lot of devices,but it did it like Twin Gate handle,  <br>00:27:45.150 all that. It was a wild car DNS [setup.It](http://setup.it/) was crazy. But services are cool.  <br>00:27:49.980 They're not the hardestsetup. It's a one-liner.  <br>00:27:51.630 Now what this also opensup is C I C D automation.  <br>00:27:55.350 And you can use things like Terraform where you can like just deploy  <br>00:27:59.015 infrastructure and with the infrastructurebuilt in the Terraform template,  <br>00:28:03.510 is that what they call it?I think it's a template,  <br>00:28:04.740 is deploying twin gate connectorsand headless clients and it just,  <br>00:28:09.450 you spin up things [automatically.It](http://automatically.it/)'s kind of crazy.  <br>00:28:12.510 So you can automate your access, automateyour zero trust. Two more things.  <br>00:28:16.200 If I go over to settings I,twin Gate's, a big thing, man.  <br>00:28:18.720 Two things you can look atright now. Identity provider,  <br>00:28:21.030 you can sync up GoogleWorkspace, Okta Azure ad.  <br>00:28:23.940 I personally use Google Workspace.Pretty cool. I sync up my employees.  <br>00:28:27.810 You can also do Secure dns.  <br>00:28:29.490 So you can actually have your clientsuse a secure DNS provider using D O H and  <br>00:28:33.450 you can specify that here. Sothat's Twin Gate. What do you think?  <br>00:28:36.240 Are you gonna throw away your VPN or areyou using something else that you think  <br>00:28:39.185 is better fighting? No, I'mjust kidding. But seriously,  <br>00:28:41.190 let me know below in the comments.I wanna know what you think.  <br>00:28:43.590 Grandma, go subscribe to Network.

(free)  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/DbF96IHOZig](https://www.youtube.com/watch/DbF96IHOZig)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.000 You've gotta see this tool. It's nuts.I can finally monitor all my stuff,  <br>00:00:04.540 all of it websites, DNS servers likeAgar game servers, raspberry pies.  <br>00:00:08.960 My kids don't make controllers.Everything in my home lab,  <br>00:00:11.600 everything in my cloud, I can see ifit's up and running or if it goes down,  <br>00:00:15.630 I finally feel like I know what's goingon and I don't even have to look at it.  <br>00:00:19.400 It'll just tell me Slack, discord,whatever this is uptime kua.  <br>00:00:23.920 A monitoring tool you cannotbelieve is free. And honestly,  <br>00:00:26.800 I would've killed four back in the day.Two reasons. You're going to love this.  <br>00:00:30.140 One, it's free. Two, it's beautiful.Come on, look at all this. And I lied.  <br>00:00:35.040 Three reasons. Three, it'sreally easy to set up.  <br>00:00:37.640 You're gonna host it yourself and by thetime you're done, you'll be like, wait,  <br>00:00:40.400 that was it. Not kidding. Five minutes.Get your stinking coffee ready.  <br>00:00:43.800 Let's do this. Now first you gottadecide where are you going to put uptime?  <br>00:00:47.640 Kuma, you got two choices. One the cloud.And number two, inside your home lab.  <br>00:00:51.800 Your home network.  <br>00:00:52.440 Now inside is cool because you caneasily monitor all your home lab stuff  <br>00:00:55.560 without even thinking about it. You don'thave to poke holes in that firewall.  <br>00:00:57.980 And you'll need somewhere to host Uptime,Kua, some kind of Linux based server,  <br>00:01:01.320 like a Raspberry Pie, a spare laptopor an enterprise grade server.  <br>00:01:04.239 But once you got a place to put it,  <br>00:01:05.560 installing is stupid easy cuz we'regonna use Docker. And Docker is amazing.  <br>00:01:08.880 It would be like that coffee breakthat's, that's how long it'll take Arrow,  <br>00:01:12.760 Chuck. Now the cloud is cooltoo. You put it up there,  <br>00:01:15.620 you don't really need anything.  <br>00:01:16.920 You can set it up right now as you'rewatching this video and just kind of play  <br>00:01:19.520 with it, just like see if it's cool.  <br>00:01:21.040 And if you use one of my favorite cloudproviders and the sponsor of this video  <br>00:01:24.130 LE Node, it'll cost you almostnothing like 0.08 cents an hour.  <br>00:01:28.170 Or if you're new to Le Node,  <br>00:01:29.240 it'll be free because they giveyou $100 credit for 60 days. I,  <br>00:01:33.360 that's just do it.  <br>00:01:35.450 So put it in the cloud and you canmonitor everything on the interwebs.  <br>00:01:38.520 You just might have a bit of a problemmonitoring your home lab stuff. Now me,  <br>00:01:41.790 I do both. I've got uptime,  <br>00:01:43.280 coma sitting right next to me in myhome lab monitoring all the things.  <br>00:01:46.080 But I also have one in thecloud redundancy also, I,  <br>00:01:48.560 I monitor my home network to see ifit stays up. Whatever you choose,  <br>00:01:51.160 it doesn't matter. I'm gonna show youboth and it's, it's pretty stink and easy.  <br>00:01:54.000 I'll start with the cloud because ittakes like three seconds and you can't go  <br>00:01:56.640 wrong with LE node. I got a link below.Head over to le [node.com/network](http://node.com/network). Chuck,  <br>00:02:00.440 again, if you're new, you'llget a $100 credit for 60 days.  <br>00:02:03.680 And once you're signed in,click on create the node.  <br>00:02:06.820 Now why this will be so fast isbecause they have a marketplace.  <br>00:02:09.520 Go and click on that and it's gonnabe like, where is it? abcV, oh,  <br>00:02:13.800 uptime Kuma right there. Just selectit, scroll down a bit, put in some info.  <br>00:02:17.520 Email address, limitedpseudo user info, password.  <br>00:02:20.740 You can skip over the DNS stuffif you don't want to use it,  <br>00:02:23.280 I'm not gonna use it rightnow. Select your region,  <br>00:02:25.190 I'll be in Dallas close to me. Andthen pick the size of your LE node,  <br>00:02:28.720 your server. I'm gonna doshared CPU nano one gigabyte,  <br>00:02:31.360 which is five bucks a month or0.01 cents an hour. So seriously,  <br>00:02:35.040 if you wanna try this out, justspin this up, play it for an hour,  <br>00:02:37.800 then delete it and you're charged thatmuch like that's it. Then label it.  <br>00:02:42.200 And dude, that's it.  <br>00:02:43.240 Click on create and take a little coffeebreak cuz you just set up a monitoring  <br>00:02:47.040 service that's gonna take a fewminutes to get baked and ready.  <br>00:02:49.480 So while it's baking,  <br>00:02:50.200 let me show you how to do the on-premsetup in the home lab. So for on-prem,  <br>00:02:54.320 I'm gonna get connectedto my on-prem server.  <br>00:02:56.480 We're gonna launch CMDon Windows Terminal.  <br>00:02:58.800 On Mac and Linux, SSH andSumi server. And I'm in.  <br>00:03:02.160 Now this install will depend on twothings, Docker and Docker compose.  <br>00:03:05.640 Let's make sure we havethose installed right now.  <br>00:03:07.440 Pseudo apt install docker.iodash y. I'm already good.  <br>00:03:11.880 Yours might take a minute. Justtake a little coffee break. Next.  <br>00:03:14.000 Docker compose. Pseudo a PT.Install Docker dash compos dash y.  <br>00:03:18.720 Now that was the hard part. Now watchDucker compose. Just do its thing.  <br>00:03:22.000 You ready? The first thing we'lldo is make a new directory, MK dir.  <br>00:03:25.230 I'll call it Makua. And thenwe'll CD into that CD Makua.  <br>00:03:29.460 And then we'll create one file.  <br>00:03:30.800 I'm gonna use Nano cause Nano is thebest fight me. Come on. Just kidding.  <br>00:03:35.220 But really I lost mytrade of thought. Nano.  <br>00:03:37.400 We'll call this dockerdash compose dot y ml.  <br>00:03:41.060 And here we're just gonna copyand paste. I got some code below.  <br>00:03:43.960 I'm gonna grab mine. I believe thisis the official stuff from Lewis Lamb,  <br>00:03:47.320 the creator of Uptime Kuma. Thatdude's amazing. Thank you Lewis.  <br>00:03:51.830 I love your tool. Now real quick,  <br>00:03:53.360 here's all we're doing withthe Docker composed file.  <br>00:03:55.200 First we're pulling the officialcontainer image from Lewis Lamb for uptime  <br>00:03:58.400 Kuma. Then we're naming itUptime Kuma. And then right here,  <br>00:04:00.960 this is very important.  <br>00:04:01.840 We're mapping a volume to make sure thatour uptime coma data is persistent even  <br>00:04:06.400 if we tear down that containerand build it back up.  <br>00:04:08.280 And then finally we expose some ports.  <br>00:04:10.330 So now that we know what we're doing andwe have a little sip of coffee, right,  <br>00:04:13.400 let's go ahead and hit control X,Y enter to save and check the out.  <br>00:04:18.200 This is all we have to do. Type in docker,  <br>00:04:20.769 compose up dash D. That'sit. You ready? .  <br>00:04:25.820 Now that was faster for me cuz Ialready had the image downloaded.  <br>00:04:28.560 It'll probably download the image for you.  <br>00:04:30.120 It'll be fairly quick And it'srunning If we do a little docker Ps,  <br>00:04:34.640 there he is, he's right there.  <br>00:04:36.090 So now all we have to do is navigate tothe IP address of our container on Port  <br>00:04:40.680 3001. Let's try it out. And here we areready to get set up. Now on LE node,  <br>00:04:45.230 it's even easier if youlook back at your LE node,  <br>00:04:47.920 all you need to do is go to the networksettings under your lin node settings  <br>00:04:52.200 stuff and scroll down just a bit untilyou see the reverse DNS information right  <br>00:04:56.880 here. That's basically a free DNSname you get if you copy that bad boy  <br>00:05:02.020 and paste that into a new tab.Uptime kua, you're ready to go.  <br>00:05:05.800 Now for the remainder of this lab, Iwill continue on my home lab setup.  <br>00:05:08.880 However, it'll be the exact sameas the cloud. So just follow along,  <br>00:05:12.560 get your username and stuff setup. You know how to do this stuff.  <br>00:05:15.400 Password in and click on create mypasswords don't match. Okay, there we go.  <br>00:05:19.980 Now here it is Uptime kua.  <br>00:05:21.720 And what you're gonna love about this ishow simple it is. Like what do you say,  <br>00:05:24.480 we monitor something right now. Let'sdo it right now we have nothing.  <br>00:05:26.720 So we'll click on add a new monitor. Andif you're new to enterprise monitoring,  <br>00:05:30.080 which is just crazy to say that we haveenterprise monitoring and our home lab.  <br>00:05:33.000 Come on guys, if you're new to it, wehave different types. If we look at 'em,  <br>00:05:36.360 there's a lot. And what you'll usedepends on what you need it for right now.  <br>00:05:39.200 What do you say? We monitor [networkchuck.com](http://networkchuck.com/). So we'll choose http,  <br>00:05:42.550 dual friendly name, put in the url.  <br>00:05:44.690 We can change how often we wantto check sixty's too long for me.  <br>00:05:47.800 Let's do like 30 or something better.  <br>00:05:50.080 You can tell it to retry a few moretimes before it considers it down.  <br>00:05:53.000 Zero's fine for me. I want it to be upall the time. Tell me when it's not up.  <br>00:05:56.120 And you got a few more values. Values.Let's jump on down to advanced.  <br>00:05:58.560 And this is pretty cool. Ifyou're monitoring your website,  <br>00:06:00.680 it's good to know if your certificate'sgoing to expire. This will tell you.  <br>00:06:04.240 Click that sucker. Also,  <br>00:06:05.360 if you're monitoring a website insideyour home lab that has a self-signed cert,  <br>00:06:08.640 you can tell it to ignore SSLcertificates, but I don't need that.  <br>00:06:11.840 And then no matter whatmonitor you choose,  <br>00:06:13.240 you'll always have the upside downloadas an option. Which essentially means,  <br>00:06:16.440 hey, is your service down? Then it'sup. Often you probably won't need it,  <br>00:06:19.880 but there are use cases. Now everythingelse you really don't need to change.  <br>00:06:22.800 But I do wanna point outhow powerful this tool is.  <br>00:06:25.260 You can tell it what statuscodes it'll accept as up.  <br>00:06:28.840 Now these are all HTTP status codesand by default it's gonna say, Hey,  <br>00:06:32.080 if we get anything in the 200 range,  <br>00:06:33.520 we're okay because 200 okay isthe best message in the world.  <br>00:06:37.000 That's what happens when you go toa website and it's up and running,  <br>00:06:39.360 you try to pull up a homepagelike network [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/).  <br>00:06:41.560 And if network [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/) is thereand alive and active and working,  <br>00:06:45.080 it'll send back all your good stuff.The homepage along with the 200.  <br>00:06:49.440 Okay message. Anything elsethat we might have a problem.  <br>00:06:51.480 And in case you're curious,  <br>00:06:53.160 anything in the 400 rangeas far as response codes goindicates there's an issue  <br>00:06:57.320 with the client, which is you,the problem's, you, your computer,  <br>00:07:00.400 the way it's trying to receiveinformation. Anything in the 500 range,  <br>00:07:03.880 it's a problem with thesite, it's a server issue,  <br>00:07:05.800 which if you're hosting your ownwebsite, the problem's still you .  <br>00:07:08.520 But yeah, that's what it tells you.  <br>00:07:10.360 Actually that's a nugget you wanna storein your pocket for pretty much anything  <br>00:07:13.200 in it, not just uptime kuma.Remember these things. Now again,  <br>00:07:16.600 most of the time 200 to okay iswhat you want to get. But again,  <br>00:07:19.640 just to kind of touch on the power ofthis thing, if you scroll up a bit more,  <br>00:07:22.680 you can control the http options. Youcan say I want the get post put patch,  <br>00:07:26.800 delete crud, all the stuff. Youcan do that, which is just amazing.  <br>00:07:29.960 But by default this will probablydo what you needed to do.  <br>00:07:32.440 But if you're more advanced youcan go crazy. That's all we need.  <br>00:07:35.240 I'm gonna click on save. And immediatelyit starts monitoring your stuff.  <br>00:07:39.000 Right now it already said,Hey, you're up, Chuck up Chuck.  <br>00:07:42.350 I hate when people say that. Don'tcomment it below, please don't do that.  <br>00:07:45.320 Now do you see how wonderful this is?Not only is it telling us that we're up,  <br>00:07:49.110 it's giving us response times abeautiful graph of response times.  <br>00:07:53.080 How quickly is your websiteresponding? Is it healthy?  <br>00:07:55.440 There's my expirations information.Oh dude, I love this so much, dude,  <br>00:07:59.560 why is my response timeso bad for my website?  <br>00:08:01.640 So you have your first monitorset up. What do you say?  <br>00:08:03.640 We set up another one real quickcause I wanna show you something. Now,  <br>00:08:05.920 website monitoring is cool and thefact that you can do an http monitor is  <br>00:08:09.760 awesome. But did you notice we haveanother option in the monitor? Type.  <br>00:08:12.560 Check this out. We have http withkeyword. What? What does that mean?  <br>00:08:17.170 It means something. Awesome. Let's try,what do you say we monitor network.  <br>00:08:19.880 chuck.coffee. Actually let'stake a coffee break for the url.  <br>00:08:23.000 We'll put in network chuck.coffee.And here's where the keyword comes in.  <br>00:08:26.560 Let's go out there real quick.  <br>00:08:27.320 Let's find a word or a phrasethat comes up when the page loads.  <br>00:08:29.880 Like right here it says start brewing.  <br>00:08:31.280 Let's take that case sensitiveand put it right here.  <br>00:08:33.400 What it will actually do is attempt toload the webpage and it will search for  <br>00:08:38.360 that keyword to make sure you'reactually loading the actual page.  <br>00:08:41.159 And if it loads the keyword, you'reup. If it doesn't, you're down.  <br>00:08:44.350 That's powerful. So I'll change thatto 30 seconds. Click on save and cool,  <br>00:08:48.600 we're up. Now, if I were to change itto something that's not on the site,  <br>00:08:51.360 if I were to edit, if I were to changeit to Ron Swanson and click save,  <br>00:08:55.680 it's gonna say it's down. And noticeit's telling me it's all degraded.  <br>00:08:58.400 It's scary and red. IfI go to my dashboard,  <br>00:09:00.840 which is right up here at the top right,  <br>00:09:02.240 it'll show me what's up and what's down.And notice it even does tell me that,  <br>00:09:05.880 hey, it's 200. Okay, but we couldn'tfind that keyword. So that's, ugh,  <br>00:09:09.520 that's so cool. Now what do you say?We speed around a few more monitors.  <br>00:09:12.440 Things you'll definitely want for yourhome lab or your business or whatever  <br>00:09:15.280 you're doing. Let's click on addnew monitor. Choose our type.  <br>00:09:18.100 Now I want to make sure ad guardis up. So I'm gonna do dns.  <br>00:09:21.000 I'll put in the host name. I want itto resolve, just say network [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/).  <br>00:09:24.190 I'll put in my A guard server as theresolver 4 53. That's what I'm using.  <br>00:09:28.340 And just change some heartbeat intervals.And that's it. Click on save. Wait,  <br>00:09:32.280 why is this thing refused make look what happened? Um, oh,  <br>00:09:35.880 why did I go to port51? Did I change that?  <br>00:09:37.760 I guess I must have you done my scrollthing. All right. Okay, we're up.  <br>00:09:41.240 That scare me for a second.Live troubleshooting. Andlook how cool this is.  <br>00:09:44.520 If you jump into thatmonitor for agar here,  <br>00:09:46.120 it will show me the resultsit's receiving. That's supercool. Now ping monitor,  <br>00:09:49.520 it's pretty straightforward. It'sgoing to send an ICMP message. Hey,  <br>00:09:52.880 are you awake? And itresponds, yes I am. If it is,  <br>00:09:55.680 you can pretty much monitoranything with that one.  <br>00:09:57.760 But this one right here ispretty powerful. The TCP port,  <br>00:10:00.360 you can specify a specific TCPport to monitor. So for example,  <br>00:10:04.040 I've got a Plex server in mynetwork, I wanna see if it's up.  <br>00:10:06.600 That's my host name. And PL bydefault, beyond port 32,400,  <br>00:10:11.240 check the every 30 seconds saveand bam. I know if Plex is up now,  <br>00:10:15.440 if I were to go in there and just stopthe service, we'll see what happens.  <br>00:10:18.000 Stopping it now it is stoppedand boom, it's down. It tells me,  <br>00:10:22.320 and I love that. Now let's get it backup. Boom. Okay, we're back up. Whew.  <br>00:10:25.810 So I think you got the monitoringpart right? It'll monitor your stuff,  <br>00:10:28.200 it'll tell you when stuff isdown or up. It's beautiful.  <br>00:10:30.520 But is it actually telling you,  <br>00:10:31.640 cuz you're not gonna sit here andlook at your dashboard all day,  <br>00:10:33.960 although you could, it'sawesome. It's mesmerizing.  <br>00:10:36.220 But you wanted to tell you when you'reout and about a quick discord or Slack  <br>00:10:39.520 message, telegram. It'll do allthose things. What do you say?  <br>00:10:42.040 We set up Slack right [now.So](http://now.so/) up here at the top, right,  <br>00:10:44.120 we'll go to your name kind of thingup there and click on settings.  <br>00:10:48.200 Well actually while I'm here you canchange all kinds of stuff like appearance,  <br>00:10:51.230 dark mode. You always wannabe in dark mode. You just do.  <br>00:10:53.680 You can set up a reverse proxy, notgonna cover that here, but maybe later.  <br>00:10:56.880 And then a nice added feature thathe didn't have to do but he did.  <br>00:10:59.760 Under security, you can set up twofactor what? I love that. But anyways,  <br>00:11:04.080 what we care about rightnow is notifications.  <br>00:11:05.600 Click on notifications and let's setup one click on set up notification.  <br>00:11:09.100 Let me show you all the options youhave. It's stupid. Look at this. What?  <br>00:11:12.990 Pretty much everything. Now again, whatI care about right now is not email.  <br>00:11:17.040 You can do email though. That'spretty cool. Uh, slack, I'll name it.  <br>00:11:20.200 And then here we'll need a web hook url,  <br>00:11:22.240 which is the URL that Uptime Kuma willuse to send a message to saying, Hey,  <br>00:11:26.400 your pluck servers down,we'll send it to that url.  <br>00:11:28.720 Slack will take it from there. A web hookis actually pretty similar to an api.  <br>00:11:31.960 It's just sitting there open, ready togo waiting to receive a message from you.  <br>00:11:35.280 Now for Slack to do this, you'llneed to set up an application.  <br>00:11:38.000 I'm not gonna cover the details of that,but they have a linked right down here.  <br>00:11:40.960 Click on that. Set up an app realquick. I'll start from scratch.  <br>00:11:44.200 I'm gonna add an incomingweb hook, turn it on,  <br>00:11:46.820 add a new web hook to the workspace.I'll choose the general channel for now.  <br>00:11:50.360 And then right here is that web hookurl. URL generator for me. I'll make it,  <br>00:11:53.000 make it a bit bigger to seeright here. I'm gonna copy that,  <br>00:11:55.920 paste that into my web hook url. Also, Igotta make sure I install that app. Oh,  <br>00:11:59.990 I already did. Okay, we're good. I'llput a username. Just call it uptime Kuma.  <br>00:12:03.400 You can do an icon emoji. I'll dothe fire one. Everything's on fire.  <br>00:12:06.770 Is emojipedia down. Theyneed some uptime coma.  <br>00:12:09.270 I don't need channel name because theweb hook is already setting that up for  <br>00:12:12.160 me. And that's pretty much it.  <br>00:12:14.020 I'm gonna test it real quick sincesuccessfully make I Slack. Yep,  <br>00:12:17.800 slack alert testing right there.  <br>00:12:19.200 And what's cool is I can apply this toall existing monitors and make it default  <br>00:12:22.200 enabled. Click on safe, good to go. Sonow if I were to stop plex again, ah,  <br>00:12:26.320 there it goes. Plex is down and there'smy Slack message. Bam, there it is.  <br>00:12:31.200 That's cool, right? Like that's sopowerful. How easy was that to do?  <br>00:12:34.790 I can't tell you how lucky we are rightnow in this day and age to have this  <br>00:12:38.480 setting up monitoring has never beeneasier and it was so hard back in the day.  <br>00:12:41.920 Not at the risk of making thisvideo way too long. .  <br>00:12:44.280 There is one more thing I wanna showyou cuz this thing's action Pat. Dude,  <br>00:12:47.880 come on. My video editor hates, hates memaking my videos too long. Eat it Nick.  <br>00:12:51.080 I don't care. Up here we havea thing called status pages.  <br>00:12:55.050 Oh I love this app is socool. They click on that.  <br>00:12:57.600 I can create a status page that I canmake available to anybody so people can  <br>00:13:01.760 monitor and tell me if my things are up.  <br>00:13:03.280 I can set it up as a dashboardon my TV or an iPad or something.  <br>00:13:06.520 So I click on ad new status page.I can name it, give it a url,  <br>00:13:10.120 slug and it up chuck, click on next.  <br>00:13:12.580 And then you just kind of make itlook pretty. You can add monitors,  <br>00:13:16.160 I'll add my network check website andyou can add all your stuff and click on  <br>00:13:20.000 save. And there it is a reallybeautiful, I mean it's kind of beautiful.  <br>00:13:23.130 We gotta make a dark mode. Ugh, therewe go. Now it's beautiful status page.  <br>00:13:27.320 You can go up here and say, we have anincident. Yo stuff is down. We know.  <br>00:13:31.810 So people can see stuff is down and theyknow that. You know, powerful stuff.  <br>00:13:34.960 Again, a tool I cannotbelieve is free and a tool.  <br>00:13:38.400 I can't believe you're notalready using. Are you using it?  <br>00:13:40.320 Like you should have gone throughthis and set it up with me.  <br>00:13:42.000 Have you not done thatyet? Do it right now.  <br>00:13:43.400 Thank you for spending time with me toset up some uptime. Kua is your stuff up?  <br>00:13:46.400 I don't know. Coffee. Bye.

You need to deploy it.  <br>00:00:03.360 Not only is it free and open source,which I don't know how that's possible,  <br>00:00:06.570 but you're gonna learn so much abouthacking and security while also protecting  <br>00:00:10.500 your stuff. It's a no-brainer.  <br>00:00:11.760 I deployed the server in about fiveminutes and then deployed agents to all of  <br>00:00:15.066 my computers and servers,Mac, windows, Lennox.  <br>00:00:17.670 Now these agents are like the tattletalesin school. They tell me everything.  <br>00:00:21.270 Things like security configurationare all my devices misconfigured?  <br>00:00:24.240 I don't know, but I do Now it'll checkfor known vulnerabilities, malware,  <br>00:00:27.660 and then this is kind of nuts.  <br>00:00:28.950 It can track a directory and see if anychanges occurred, files added removed,  <br>00:00:33.090 documents edited, andthis is even crazier.  <br>00:00:35.100 It can track the changes to theWindows registry. Are you kidding me?  <br>00:00:38.130 It's amazing.  <br>00:00:38.820 So all these devices send all theinformation to my server and I can see  <br>00:00:42.030 everything from onelocation. I get alerts,  <br>00:00:44.430 which can come at me viaemail or Slack or whatever.  <br>00:00:46.800 I can do things in response tothose alerts. Active response.  <br>00:00:49.775 So not only can I detect a brute forceattack, I can do something about it.  <br>00:00:53.490 Block that IP, address. Thisserver or this tool is called waza.  <br>00:00:56.910 It's a type of cybersecuritytool called asim,  <br>00:00:59.190 security Information and Event Management.But I so badly wanna call it a siem.  <br>00:01:03.360 I'm gonna call it a siem. I don't care.  <br>00:01:04.800 This type of tool is what the blue teamor defensive side of cybersecurity will  <br>00:01:08.340 use to defend against the bad guys tostop the hackers. So on this video,  <br>00:01:11.910 I'm gonna show you how to deploy thiscuz you need to. It's amazing. Again,  <br>00:01:15.390 not only will you beprotecting your stuff,  <br>00:01:17.340 but you're gonna learn so much and it'salso kind of addicting. And seriously,  <br>00:01:21.210 this is something you could probably puton your resume. This is a project like,  <br>00:01:24.060 hey, I run my own seam,sim seam seam seams.  <br>00:01:28.740 Pretty cool, doesn't it? ,I That was lame. I'm sorry.  <br>00:01:31.830 So you're convinced, let's talk aboutwhat you need. Really only two things.  <br>00:01:34.740 A Linux server or computer and somethingto monitor. So other computers,  <br>00:01:39.570 most flavors of Lennox are supported.I'll be installing it on Ubuntu.  <br>00:01:42.840 And more specifically, I'll be on a cloudmachine in ano. That's what I prefer.  <br>00:01:46.860 So I can monitor everything withease and also it's ridiculously easy.  <br>00:01:50.520 I'll walk you through it here ina bit. But it can also be on-prem,  <br>00:01:53.010 on a server you already have. Orit can be on a Docker container.  <br>00:01:55.770 Lemme get some room here, alreadygot a room, scoot down. There we go.  <br>00:01:58.680 And they even have an ova foreasy deployment on virtual box.  <br>00:02:01.740 Now as far as systemrequirements for the Wza server,  <br>00:02:04.290 lemme show you what theyrecommend. At minimum,  <br>00:02:06.120 they want two gigs of RAM and two CPUcores. That'll work for most people.  <br>00:02:10.080 If you got a lot of devices, if you'regonna be collecting lots of logs,  <br>00:02:12.395 you wanna go larger. Four gigs ofRam and eight CPU cores. Now again,  <br>00:02:16.320 I'm gonna walk you through the cloudoption and then also sprinkle in a little  <br>00:02:19.110 bit of dog or two just for fun. Oh,almost forgot the most important thing.  <br>00:02:22.260 Coffee. Everything in it requirescoffee. It's just the rules.  <br>00:02:27.900 Network.  <br>00:02:28.110 Chuck.coffee first. All we'll setup. Waza or wsu, I'm not sure.  <br>00:02:31.230 I'm just gonna call it waza in the cloud.  <br>00:02:33.065 So let's head on over to [od.com/networkchuck](http://od.com/networkchuck) or check the link below.  <br>00:02:37.350 Now not only is LY nodethe sponsor of this video,  <br>00:02:39.540 but they are my favorite cloud provider.Like I'm not lying, check this up.  <br>00:02:42.450 I have way too many virtual machines inthe cloud because I just go in here and  <br>00:02:46.050 spin up something.Anytime I have a project,  <br>00:02:47.940 anytime I wanna mess withsomething, I just go to LE Node,  <br>00:02:50.460 spin up a quick virtual machine inseconds. Now if you're new to LE Node,  <br>00:02:53.760 this is gonna be free foryou. For the first 60 days,  <br>00:02:56.010 they're gonna give you $100 creditto go crazy and play around with it.  <br>00:02:59.140 So if you haven't already,  <br>00:02:59.920 go ahead and get signed up right nowand then get signed in and meet me back  <br>00:03:02.950 here.  <br>00:03:03.280 Now the other reason I love Le Node isthey make deploying virtual machines like  <br>00:03:06.130 waza. Super stinking easy. Check thisout. I'm gonna go to create Lin node.  <br>00:03:09.730 I'll click on Marketplace and thenI'll search for waza. There it is.  <br>00:03:13.390 Let's go and click on that and justhave it selected and we'll scroll down a  <br>00:03:16.215 bit.  <br>00:03:16.420 Now time for just a little bit of configFirst put an email address then for the  <br>00:03:19.810 SSL certificate. Then a limitedpseudo user account, Bernard hack.  <br>00:03:23.410 Well this can beanything. Just make it up.  <br>00:03:24.940 Put a password in and we'll scrolldown just a little bit until we see.  <br>00:03:28.600 Select an image. We'reusing Ubuntu Perfect region.  <br>00:03:31.450 Select somewhere close toyou. Leno is a cloud provider.  <br>00:03:33.430 So they have data centers everywhere.  <br>00:03:35.080 Pick somewhere close to you so it'llbe nice and fast. I'm in Dallas.  <br>00:03:37.960 And finally our LE node plan. Fromhere, let's click on share. At cpu,  <br>00:03:41.080 they're cheaper. And here we have ourplans or the size of our virtual machine.  <br>00:03:44.440 Now normally I would pick this oneright here. It's five bucks a month,  <br>00:03:47.320 super cheap. But for waza, you wantsomething a bit beefier, a bit bigger,  <br>00:03:51.010 something more like theLE node, four gigabyte.  <br>00:03:52.870 Now if you don't select the four gigabyteoption for this WASA installation,  <br>00:03:56.380 it just won't work. I tried [it.So](http://it.so/) just make sure you select this.  <br>00:03:59.530 Now if you do wanna go for a smalleroption, like the LE node, two gigabyte,  <br>00:04:02.470 I actually got that working withDocker and it worked pretty well.  <br>00:04:05.170 I'll walk you through that here in asecond. Well, let's go ahead and do this.  <br>00:04:07.390 It's really not much more. It'sso easy. So select four gigabyte.  <br>00:04:10.330 Scroll down just a bit, labelthis sucker, whatever you want.  <br>00:04:14.140 Enter a root password.  <br>00:04:15.280 And finally we'll scroll down and clickon create LE node at the bottom right.  <br>00:04:18.790 Ready, set, go. Nowit's gonna do its thing.  <br>00:04:21.250 It's gonna bake you a VM inthe cloud. Quick coffee break,  <br>00:04:26.410 it'll be a few minutes. And once yousee that your LE node is running,  <br>00:04:29.830 we can try and connect to it. Overhere we have our SSH access command.  <br>00:04:32.980 We're gonna go ahead and copy thisright here and then launch your terminal  <br>00:04:35.770 Windows, Mac and Linux. It'll allwork. And paste that in there. Enter,  <br>00:04:39.340 accept all fingerprints. Putyour password in and we're in.  <br>00:04:42.550 But it may not be quite ready. Waza isstill going through its installation.  <br>00:04:46.060 We can monitor it kind of rightnow by typing in H top H T O P.  <br>00:04:50.530 And we'll see right at the top there,the top process. D P K G or D package.  <br>00:04:55.000 That's how apps on Linux are installedand that's what's happening right now.  <br>00:04:58.240 So we can kinda sit there andwatch that until that stops.  <br>00:05:00.645 And we can try to connect herein a moment and like see here,  <br>00:05:02.470 we have some wza stuff there. TheWZA index year is being installed.  <br>00:05:05.770 There's a bunch of pieces toit. It's amazing. But again,  <br>00:05:07.780 quick coffee break andwatch the magic happen.  <br>00:05:11.020 Now at this point it's been aboutsix minutes. Let's see if it's done.  <br>00:05:13.930 And we'll start with grabbingour password. By the way,  <br>00:05:16.090 I hit control C to get out of that,  <br>00:05:17.560 if we type in LS dash aland our terminal here,  <br>00:05:20.590 we should see a dot deploymentdash secrets dot txc file.  <br>00:05:24.670 There it has our secrets or ourpasswords. Let's go ahead and cap that.  <br>00:05:27.430 Cats dot deployment secrets,blah blah. Got it. Bam.  <br>00:05:30.280 There's our passwords right there.  <br>00:05:31.360 The first one we want is theadmin password at the top.  <br>00:05:33.580 Got our admin username and our adminpassword. Cool, keep that there.  <br>00:05:36.880 Let's go back to ourLE node dashboard here.  <br>00:05:38.650 And we're gonna grab our LE node reverseDNS name or R D N S. So here Leno node.  <br>00:05:42.880 Click on the network tab.  <br>00:05:44.170 Scroll down just a little bit untilwe see the IP addresses section.  <br>00:05:47.830 And then we have the reverse DNS righthere. There it is. Just go and grab that,  <br>00:05:51.850 copy it.  <br>00:05:52.600 Open a new tab and go to https colonwhack whack paste that in .  <br>00:05:57.650 Here we go. It's there. Now let's getlogged in. Use your name admin password.  <br>00:06:01.700 Let's grab that from the terminalthere. It's copy and paste.  <br>00:06:05.870 It's gonna check and make sure thingsare good. Almost there or good. Awesome.  <br>00:06:09.560 This seems pretty cool. Last timeI'll do that joke. Probably not.  <br>00:06:13.310 Seems like a ock. Sorry .It's terrible. Now before we move on,  <br>00:06:17.180 I'm gonna show the dockerinstall. It's super easy.  <br>00:06:19.910 If you don't care about that,that's fine. Just skip ahead.  <br>00:06:22.015 I've got timestamps below. Nowhere's the docker install. Perfect.  <br>00:06:24.800 Four on-prem or a smaller machine on LEnode, which is what I'll be doing here.  <br>00:06:28.790 Leno. I'm gonna click on create le node.  <br>00:06:30.620 I'll just deploy a standardUbuntu 2204 lts machine,  <br>00:06:35.300 shared cpu. I know that the LEnode, two gigabyte plan will work.  <br>00:06:38.990 I tried it on the one gig, the containersjust wouldn't run. Don't try it.  <br>00:06:42.260 But the two gig plan, it worked [great.So](http://great.so/) click that, label it something fun,  <br>00:06:45.560 put a password in and then click oncreate le node. How fast was that?  <br>00:06:49.340 Now if you're doing this on-prem,  <br>00:06:50.450 just have a server that's running Dockerand of course if you want to run the  <br>00:06:53.600 ova, I'll put a link below and wassdocumentation. After a moment or two,  <br>00:06:57.140 you should see that your machine isrunning. Let's go and connect to it.  <br>00:07:00.110 We'll grab our SSH access command overhere. Just copy that. Launch my terminal,  <br>00:07:03.830 paste it, head enter, accept allfingerprints, password. And we're in.  <br>00:07:07.730 Couple things we'll do real quick.First we'll update our repositories.  <br>00:07:10.250 Pseudo a P t update. Now many of you'regonna go, why is he doing pseudo?  <br>00:07:13.730 You're route. I always do pseudocause I don't know what you're using.  <br>00:07:17.330 You may not be root right now. I justwanna make it simple. Anyways, I digress.  <br>00:07:21.650 Pseudo PT update to update ourrepositories. Once that finishes up,  <br>00:07:24.830 we'll do a pseudo PT andinstall [docker.io](http://docker.io/) and docker  <br>00:07:29.630 dash compose. We'll doa dash y at the end.  <br>00:07:32.420 This is going to install dockerand Docker compose. So let's go.  <br>00:07:35.420 Should be fairly quick. More of a coffeesip here. Awesome, it is finished.  <br>00:07:39.650 The next step, I've got a link below.  <br>00:07:41.120 Go ahead and pull up the Wazadocumentation for a docker deployment.  <br>00:07:44.480 Well one two punch this real quick.  <br>00:07:45.800 First we'll clone the get repositoryone command. Let's copy that.  <br>00:07:49.100 Go back to your terminal, paste thatcommand assuming you have get installed.  <br>00:07:52.130 Most oss do clone. Awesome type in Ls.  <br>00:07:54.710 We'll see a new directorycalled waza Docker.  <br>00:07:56.960 Let's go ahead and CD into that cd,waza, Docker type in LS once more.  <br>00:08:01.280 And we have one moredirectory we wanna jump into.  <br>00:08:03.650 It's the single node directory becausewe're deploying one single node or  <br>00:08:07.250 computer cd single node. Perfect.  <br>00:08:10.520 Now the next thing we'll have to do isgenerate some self sign certificates.  <br>00:08:13.880 They make that super easy for us.  <br>00:08:15.145 They even have a Docker composefile to run and do that for us.  <br>00:08:18.080 And all we have to do iscopy and paste this command.  <br>00:08:19.820 So copy this command right here,paste that in there, hit enter.  <br>00:08:23.810 It's gonna pull those images down.Run, compose. And then that was it.  <br>00:08:27.410 That's done. Now for our next step,  <br>00:08:28.880 all we have to do is do thedocker dash compose command  <br>00:08:33.740 with the up option. And then we'll do adash D to launch it in the background.  <br>00:08:37.730 This will do everything for us. Thisis our last step in deploying this.  <br>00:08:40.700 It's super easy. I love docker. Ready,set, go. This will take a moment.  <br>00:08:45.320 It's deploying a multi-tierapplication, pulling all the images,  <br>00:08:48.740 a lot of stuff going on. Little coffeebreak. We'll give it some time here.  <br>00:08:51.740 Okay, deployment is done, done, done.  <br>00:08:54.110 Let's confirm real quickby typing in docker stats.  <br>00:08:57.780 Get a realtime view of those suckersrunning. Let's go get logged in.  <br>00:09:00.930 Let's check it out. We'll getback to our Leno dashboard here.  <br>00:09:03.360 Go to the network tab. Scrolldown just a little bit,  <br>00:09:05.640 find our reverse DNS name righthere in the IP addresses section.  <br>00:09:09.690 Go ahead and copy that and we'llopen up a new tab. Type in https,  <br>00:09:13.200 colon whack whack, paste that inthere. Let's go. Fingers crossed. Okay,  <br>00:09:16.800 this is a self-signed cert. We'll getthis little error message. No big deal.  <br>00:09:19.710 Should proceed. Was that sorry. Um,this video has so many lame jokes.  <br>00:09:23.460 Let's get logged in. Default. Login willbe admin password will be according to.  <br>00:09:27.660 Was it documentation? Whatwas it? Was it ? Sorry.  <br>00:09:32.400 Sorry, not sorry. Oh, it's uh, secretpassword. Capital S. Capital P.  <br>00:09:36.360 Easy enough. Just gotta check and makesure things are good. Almost. Okay,  <br>00:09:40.200 things are good. Now thatwe have, was it installed?  <br>00:09:42.720 Let's get some agents added.Computers that we can monitor.  <br>00:09:45.150 So right here we'll click on addagent right here in the dashboard.  <br>00:09:48.330 And then right here we'll havethe option to deploy a new agent.  <br>00:09:51.330 Go ahead and click on that. Thisis super straightforward and easy.  <br>00:09:53.760 We'll start with theLinux host first. Again,  <br>00:09:55.410 I'm gonna do Ubuntu and we'll doa Windows after this. By the way,  <br>00:09:57.990 Ubuntu 15 or more architecture is X 86.  <br>00:10:01.170 But notice we have optionsfor everything. It's awesome.  <br>00:10:03.690 Then we'll put our was aserver address in here.  <br>00:10:05.520 This will simply be your LE node,  <br>00:10:06.930 reverse DNS name if you did it withme or it could be an IP address.  <br>00:10:09.480 Just something that the agent can haveaccess to. So I'll copy that server.  <br>00:10:12.660 Address the F Q D N fully qualifieddomain name just like this.  <br>00:10:16.770 I will name that agent. It's optionalbut I like to Callie underscore Linux.  <br>00:10:21.300 We'll select a group. I'llput it in the default group.  <br>00:10:23.460 And then on step six they give you onecommand to install the agent. Super cool.  <br>00:10:27.180 Super easy. Let's copy that. Copy command.  <br>00:10:29.190 And then here in Cali I'll launch myterminal. Paste that command head,  <br>00:10:32.340 enter pseudo password and it's done.Cool. One more thing we have to do,  <br>00:10:37.260 getting back to the was a dashboard.We need to enable this as a service.  <br>00:10:40.385 We'll just copy this. Commandall system, CTL commands,  <br>00:10:42.870 paste those commands in there,head enter and done. Awesome.  <br>00:10:46.410 So now getting back to the WASA dashboard.  <br>00:10:48.270 We can go to the top left here onthis drop down and click on agents.  <br>00:10:51.390 There it is right there. My first littleguy, Callie Lennox, his IP address os.  <br>00:10:56.310 And it's gonna show us so much more.Oh, I can't wait to show you this,  <br>00:10:59.135 but first, before we do that,let's add Windows real quick.  <br>00:11:01.260 But notice how fast and easy thisis and Windows. It's just as easy.  <br>00:11:04.020 Let's go ahead and douh, deploy new agent.  <br>00:11:06.000 Once more this time we'llclick on Windows. Goodness,  <br>00:11:08.790 they still have WindowsXP in here. .  <br>00:11:11.280 I guess you need a scenefor this man. But anyways,  <br>00:11:13.500 I'm on Windows seven or more orgreater. No Windows arm support, sad,  <br>00:11:16.950 fully qualified domain name would be oursame. I uh, domain name or IP address.  <br>00:11:20.700 Again, just something your agent can haveaccess to. I'll name it default group.  <br>00:11:24.330 And finally at step six, just like Linux,  <br>00:11:26.430 we're gonna have our littleone-liner command using PowerShell.  <br>00:11:29.280 Keeping in mind you will need to runthis as administrator cause you will need  <br>00:11:32.580 admin privileges. So I'lljust copy that command,  <br>00:11:34.680 jump into my Windows computer here.  <br>00:11:36.870 So here in Windows I'lllaunch my Windows terminal.  <br>00:11:38.850 Keeping in mind I'll haveto launch it as admin.  <br>00:11:40.740 So right click this and click on run asadministrator. Pace my command in there,  <br>00:11:44.430 hit enter. Gonna do its thing.And then one more command.  <br>00:11:47.010 We'll have to start theservice here on Windows.  <br>00:11:48.990 Just like Linux net start was a SVCwas a is starting and we're off to the  <br>00:11:53.410 races. Let's go check Waza, the Wazadashboard. We'll go to our agents.  <br>00:11:56.710 Oh there it is. It's still coming up.  <br>00:11:58.330 Let's click on refresh over here onthe right. Refresh, refresh, refresh.  <br>00:12:01.420 Come on. Connect. I'm impatient.And after a billion refreshes. No,  <br>00:12:04.240 I'm just kidding. It was likethree. Um, it's up. Awesome.  <br>00:12:07.120 And here's our two machines at Lennoxand Windows. And you know what,  <br>00:12:10.540 I wanna add one morejust for fun. Ready Go.  <br>00:12:14.050 It was seriously actuallyalmost that fast.  <br>00:12:16.090 So here we have our agents and now let'sclick on one of these and see what's  <br>00:12:19.150 going on. This is gonna be [fun.So](http://fun.so/) I'm gonna click on the new one.  <br>00:12:21.280 I just added the Circs network. Chuck,that's from my CIRCS search video.  <br>00:12:25.780 It's a public box and it'sgonna be kind of fun to look at.  <br>00:12:28.065 It's click on that guy. And here's ouragent dashboard for this one computer,  <br>00:12:31.360 this one server. There's a lot going on.  <br>00:12:33.100 But just keep in mindat the top here in Waza,  <br>00:12:34.720 we kind of have breadcrumbsand I love this.  <br>00:12:36.520 We've got agents and we're drilled downinto the specific agent we're looking  <br>00:12:39.645 at. And then here at thedashboard, so much going on.  <br>00:12:42.430 Now I'm not gonna show youeverything. There's way too much,  <br>00:12:44.530 way too much fun to be had.  <br>00:12:45.705 But I will point out a fewthings that are like kind of wow.  <br>00:12:48.250 First the Mitre framework.The Mitre attack framework.  <br>00:12:51.340 We won't go too deep into this,  <br>00:12:52.510 but just know it's a database of hackingtechniques that hackers will use to  <br>00:12:55.720 attack machines. This will look atthat framework and tell you, Hey,  <br>00:12:59.710 your machine might be vulnerable to this,  <br>00:13:01.840 these tactics or your machine isactively being attacked in these ways.  <br>00:13:06.190 And notice, um, some thingsare happening to mine.  <br>00:13:08.470 We'll take a look at those here ina bit. And then quick drive by here.  <br>00:13:11.350 Compliance. Many companies have to obeycertain compliance standards like pci,  <br>00:13:15.145 gdpr, nist, hipaa. This willcheck all your computers,  <br>00:13:18.580 all your servers and tell you what'sgoing on. That's kind of crazy. Now,  <br>00:13:22.270 you may not care about policies. Youshould if you wanna get into security,  <br>00:13:25.000 but it may not be important foryou right now. Scroll down a bit.  <br>00:13:27.100 What about configuration? Is your serveror your computer configured securely?  <br>00:13:30.490 Do you know that for a fact?Well this will tell you .  <br>00:13:33.070 It has a module called SCAor secure configuration.  <br>00:13:36.370 I think it's audit or assessment,secure configuration assessment.  <br>00:13:39.610 And it will pull out a C I S assessment.  <br>00:13:42.040 This is for buntu Linux andtell you how good you are. Um,  <br>00:13:44.770 39% on my score failed 715 of these.  <br>00:13:48.040 Now let me give you like kind ofa baseline for what that means.  <br>00:13:50.020 Let's jump into this report.Notice here in the breadcrumbs,  <br>00:13:52.000 I did jump into the security configurationassessment section and it'll tell me  <br>00:13:55.480 all the things I failed at. Let meactually sort by. Uh, good stuff.  <br>00:13:58.750 It's gonna be a small list. Andmost of this is like default.  <br>00:14:00.970 So like App Armor is installed cool,  <br>00:14:03.010 but it'll go deeper and tell you thingslike hey you should disable USB storage.  <br>00:14:05.860 If that drill down to SSH cuz you cansearch for specific things like that.  <br>00:14:08.740 Keyword . It'll tell me thingslike, hey don't install Telenet.  <br>00:14:11.860 U F W is not enabled.Disable ssh sh root login.  <br>00:14:14.920 So not only is it showingyou like hey you're insecure,  <br>00:14:17.080 but it's also teaching you. Causeif I click on any one of these,  <br>00:14:19.420 it'll tell me like, Heyhere's the rationale, here'swhy we're telling you this.  <br>00:14:22.360 Here's how you fix it,here's how you check it.  <br>00:14:24.520 And then it shows you all the miretechniques that can be used against having  <br>00:14:27.765 that misconfiguration. That's sofreaking powerful. Are you kidding me?  <br>00:14:31.270 It's okay, I'm getting a littleexcited coffee, you'll calm me down.  <br>00:14:35.440 That's just one module speed mode. Let'sget back to our agent dashboard here.  <br>00:14:38.890 Here on the menu we have security eventsshowing you things like authentication  <br>00:14:41.800 failures, which could be brute forceattacks. It'll show you top five alerts.  <br>00:14:45.280 It'll give you a list ofsecurity alerts. Super powerful.  <br>00:14:47.890 And then here's something you're notgonna see right away. If I click on more,  <br>00:14:50.770 we have vulnerabilities.  <br>00:14:52.580 It'll check your system forvulnerabilities but it'snot enabled by default.  <br>00:14:55.400 I'll show you how to dothis here in a moment.  <br>00:14:57.230 But I have another system I alreadyhad up and running and if I look at  <br>00:14:59.870 vulnerabilities for that one,  <br>00:15:01.490 it's gonna check all myapplications and tell me like, Hey,  <br>00:15:04.310 are there known CBEs out thereor common vulnerabilities?  <br>00:15:07.640 And I've got a bunch likea lot. But just look at this,  <br>00:15:11.300 deploy this for your house or yourservers or whatever you have and play  <br>00:15:14.390 security admin. Go in here and go,oh wow, I've got 170 critical CDEs.  <br>00:15:18.680 I should go figure out how to fixthose. The learning opportunity.  <br>00:15:21.740 Are you kidding me? And then hereon my server I already had going.  <br>00:15:24.260 I do wanna show you one thing here on oneof my Windows hosts or Windows agents.  <br>00:15:28.400 This is kind of fun. I have my daughter'scomputer here, this is amazing.  <br>00:15:31.010 Check this out. I'll click on Chloe.  <br>00:15:32.720 And the one thing you're gonna loveabout Windows Host is the integrity  <br>00:15:36.170 monitoring module. Oh my gosh,thing's amazing. Check it out.  <br>00:15:39.830 The sucker's gonna monitor all theimportant files and registry keys that are  <br>00:15:44.360 normally modified whensomething's being hacked.  <br>00:15:46.400 It's gonna look at things and tellyou when things are being adjusted.  <br>00:15:48.830 So like check this out. If I go to events,  <br>00:15:50.570 it'll tell me each time aregister key is changed.  <br>00:15:52.550 Like this one was deleted firewallpolicy. I don't know why that happened.  <br>00:15:55.640 Now some of these are automatic,like the Windows OS is doing it,  <br>00:15:58.370 but others can be bad. It's gotta crazy.  <br>00:16:01.580 And it's not just registry keys.If I go to inventory over here,  <br>00:16:03.950 I can see that it hasinventory of the files,  <br>00:16:05.390 it's monitoring and all the registry keys,  <br>00:16:07.190 it's monitoring and what they'recurrently set to. Is it not insane?  <br>00:16:09.890 And here in a moment I'llshow you how you can s uh,  <br>00:16:11.575 monitor specific keys and get alerts onthose keys and files too. It's so fun.  <br>00:16:15.950 Now at this point your seamseems to be doing great. I lied,  <br>00:16:19.220 I was gonna do it one more [time.It](http://time.it/) seems to be doing pretty good.  <br>00:16:21.260 Pretty much all youhave to do is set it up,  <br>00:16:23.060 connect an agent to it and it collectsinformation and you can go crazy and  <br>00:16:26.750 learn cybersecurity andstart to protect your stuff.  <br>00:16:29.660 But you can also tinker with this quitea bit. You can enable more modules,  <br>00:16:32.690 set up more alerts, monitor morethings. So if you're interested in that,  <br>00:16:35.815 we're gonna walk througha few more options here.  <br>00:16:37.910 Now the first thing we'll do is lookat file monitoring through Windows.  <br>00:16:41.120 It's so powerful and so cool. Soback here at the WASA incense,  <br>00:16:44.810 I deployed with youright now in this video.  <br>00:16:46.700 Couple things real quick justbefore we jump into that.  <br>00:16:48.530 If I click on the home icon,  <br>00:16:49.610 it's gonna take me to the WASA dashboardand it's gonna show me like all the  <br>00:16:52.040 modules I could jump into. So for example,if I wanna jump into security events,  <br>00:16:55.340 it's gonna show me security events.  <br>00:16:56.480 But right now it's beingfiltered to look at one agent.  <br>00:16:59.030 I can unpin that to where it's showingme everything from every agent.  <br>00:17:02.270 That's pretty cool. And you can do thatwith most modules. Let's go back home.  <br>00:17:05.060 Now let's click on Waza oncemore. Will Waza drop down here?  <br>00:17:08.030 Let's click on agents. Now again,I'm not going over everything.  <br>00:17:10.940 Every little thing you can do and youdon't have to know all these things,  <br>00:17:13.520 but you can play aroundwith it. You can go crazy.  <br>00:17:16.310 I'm just giving you enough to getstarted and have a little bit of fun and  <br>00:17:18.710 things I got really excited [about.So](http://about.so/) let's click on agents here.  <br>00:17:21.170 We'll click on my Windows machine.  <br>00:17:22.640 A couple things I'm gonnashow you real quick.  <br>00:17:23.960 If I click on Integrity Monitoring,  <br>00:17:25.339 this is the module thatwe'll use to monitor files.  <br>00:17:28.160 Notice I don't have any events right now.  <br>00:17:29.540 I've got it filtered right now by thelast 24 hours and I've just connected this  <br>00:17:32.900 thing, nothing's happened.But if I go to the inventory,  <br>00:17:35.240 I can see that it already has scannedand inventoried all the default files.  <br>00:17:39.260 It'll look for in thedirectories. And my registry keys.  <br>00:17:41.600 I believe it's set to scaneverything every 12 hours.  <br>00:17:45.020 And if it notices a change, it'll letyou know. It'll alert you. Pretty cool.  <br>00:17:47.870 But with files we can also do realtime notification and rule set.  <br>00:17:51.450 Check this out.  <br>00:17:52.290 I'm gonna jump into my Windows host andchange some configuration for the agent  <br>00:17:55.830 file. Now you can find that here.I'm gonna go to my Windows Explorer,  <br>00:17:58.530 go to my C Drive, goto program files X 86.  <br>00:18:01.440 Now if this is all like weird foryou, like oh man Windows file system,  <br>00:18:03.990 I don't know what's going on.  <br>00:18:05.190 I do detail a lot of what this meansand how it's organized in my Windows  <br>00:18:08.910 Fundamentals course on my academy.Check it out, link below. Anyways,  <br>00:18:12.120 let's continue. It's an X 86 andin a folder called OS sec Agent,  <br>00:18:16.920 jump in there. Continue.You gotta have admin access.  <br>00:18:19.680 If I scroll down just a bit,I'll see a file named os [sec.com](http://sec.com/).  <br>00:18:23.430 That's your configurationfile for your agent.  <br>00:18:25.320 Let's go to open that with notepad.Open with notepad. Oh, by the way,  <br>00:18:28.920 you can do the same thing on Linux.I'll put documentation below.  <br>00:18:31.980 It's pretty much the same process, justediting the same type of agent file.  <br>00:18:35.430 But let's walk through thisreal quick here in this file,  <br>00:18:36.930 I'm just gonna search for sis checkto get to the SIS check section.  <br>00:18:41.760 That's hard to say.. And here right uh,  <br>00:18:44.100 you can see that I have the fileintegrity monitoring section.  <br>00:18:47.040 And you can see right here all thedirectories that is by default set to  <br>00:18:50.760 monitor.  <br>00:18:51.390 So what we'll do here is we'll justchoose a place amongst all these directory  <br>00:18:54.515 options and we'll add alittle configuration here.  <br>00:18:57.570 We'll type in directories and we'lladd an option that'll give us real time  <br>00:19:00.630 alerts. It's really simple what'scalled real time, just like that.  <br>00:19:04.025 Have it equal yes in quotes.  <br>00:19:05.310 We'll add one more optionreport underscore changes.  <br>00:19:08.400 Have that equal yes in quotes andwe'll add one more check underscore  <br>00:19:13.140 all and have that equal yes as well.  <br>00:19:15.780 So just to make sure we'reall on the same page here,  <br>00:19:17.370 we're specifying a directory and we'regiving it these options real time. Yes,  <br>00:19:21.150 report changes, yes. And checkall. Yes, we'll close that out.  <br>00:19:24.510 And then add the directory. We'regonna monitor with all these options.  <br>00:19:27.330 Let's see to our desktop.  <br>00:19:28.140 So we'll do CE colon slashusers slash your username.  <br>00:19:32.520 Mine is network check slash desktop.  <br>00:19:35.220 And then we'll close that out with aleft arrow forward slash directories just  <br>00:19:39.900 like this. So now we'llsave this file, file save.  <br>00:19:42.060 And then we'll restart the service bylaunching our terminal as administrator.  <br>00:19:44.940 Right click run as administratorand we'll say restart service.  <br>00:19:49.140 Dash name waza. [Cool.So](http://cool.so/) that should be good.  <br>00:19:52.140 So I'm gonna open up myWaza dashboard real quick.  <br>00:19:53.850 Make sure I'm on the events tab.Notice and look at the last 24 hours,  <br>00:19:57.060 nothing's happened. Let'schange something on our desktop.  <br>00:19:59.460 This is so cool and powerful. I hopethis illustrates how cool this is.  <br>00:20:02.250 She's gonna go to my desktop and I'mgonna add a new file, new text document.  <br>00:20:06.210 Can you see this? Just takeabout five seconds. One, two,  <br>00:20:10.830 let's take a look. Let'srefresh this. .  <br>00:20:15.030 There it is. No, it's weird.I said added, deleted, added.  <br>00:20:17.850 Oh I think because they changedthe name in real time. But look,  <br>00:20:20.070 it monitored that I add a new, uh, anew file. Um, check this out. So that's,  <br>00:20:23.190 that's one alert. If I change anythingabout it, let's open it up. Say, Hey,  <br>00:20:27.090 I'm changing stuff. We'll save it,we'll see if the new alert comes in.  <br>00:20:30.030 I'll refresh my optionshere or refresh my page.  <br>00:20:32.520 There it is sis check eventmodified. And it's like, Hey,  <br>00:20:35.670 the check sum changed on this.  <br>00:20:37.350 It'll even tell me down herewhat I changed the text Iadded. How crazy is that?  <br>00:20:41.880 Now we can do the same kind ofthing with the Windows registry.  <br>00:20:44.070 Now it won't be real time,they don't have that option,  <br>00:20:46.590 but it will scan every 12 hours.You can change that interval.  <br>00:20:49.300 Let me share real quick. We can [specify.So](http://specify.so/) right now Pilic was an inventory,  <br>00:20:53.170 right? We can see that it does havean inventory. Look at our new file.  <br>00:20:56.710 It does have an inventory of registeredkeys that automatically monitors,  <br>00:20:59.920 but we can add specific onesthat we want to have seen.  <br>00:21:02.050 So let's add a custom one real quick.  <br>00:21:03.460 I'll open up a red edit herein Windows to edit my registry.  <br>00:21:07.090 Let's add one inside. Uh, I don't know,hq, local machine. We'll go to software,  <br>00:21:11.440 maybe classes. And let's add oneright here, right click say New key,  <br>00:21:16.420 we'll say Bernard Hack. Well bam,  <br>00:21:20.080 we'll change the value to something fun.  <br>00:21:22.780 So what I'll do here is I'll right clickthis key and say copy key name and then  <br>00:21:26.590 we'll go back to ouragent configuration file.  <br>00:21:28.960 And you'll notice just under that samekind of section where we're adding  <br>00:21:31.660 directories, we also haveregistry keys we can add.  <br>00:21:34.240 So I'll go kind oftowards the bottom here,  <br>00:21:35.860 just underneath the last registry entryand right before the entry to ignore,  <br>00:21:41.590 I'll line myself up with everythingelse, type in Windows registry,  <br>00:21:46.390 paste my key name,  <br>00:21:47.680 and then close it out with a left arrowforward slash Windows registry and a  <br>00:21:51.730 right arrow. Cool, thatshould be all we need.  <br>00:21:54.100 And it'll change thefrequency cuz like I said,  <br>00:21:55.900 it's gonna take 12 hours to findthis. We don't want it to do that.  <br>00:21:59.110 So up here we have frequency that CIScheck is executed by default every 12  <br>00:22:03.280 hours. 43, 200.  <br>00:22:05.200 Let's change that from thatto 60. So every, every minute.  <br>00:22:10.060 Actually let's do 30 seconds. Let'sbe quick. So I'll save this file.  <br>00:22:14.290 I'll restart my service. My was aservice to once some more restart.  <br>00:22:17.410 Service name was a Got it go. Cool.  <br>00:22:19.570 So getting back to our WASA dashboardhere in our integrity monitoring section  <br>00:22:22.870 for our Windows machine.  <br>00:22:24.130 I'm gonna go over here to inventory andjust see if it finds that new registry  <br>00:22:26.800 key. I'll go to registry, I'll searchfor, what do we name it Bernard?  <br>00:22:31.660 Nothing yet. Way for it to findit. There it is right there.  <br>00:22:34.510 So it found the key. It's lookingat it, it's monitoring it. Cool.  <br>00:22:37.660 Now let's go to events. Now you seethat we've got some registry changes,  <br>00:22:40.600 mainly time and we're getting thatbecause we were setting it to every 30  <br>00:22:43.420 seconds. Notice nothing about aregistry key here. Let's go change it.  <br>00:22:46.210 Let's go modify it. Hammer Bernard, hack.  <br>00:22:47.805 Well I'll change the valueto something else. Fun  <br>00:22:52.930 or you got hacked. Cool, let's changeit there. It'll take about 30 seconds.  <br>00:22:57.280 Take a little coffee break andlet's monitor our was the dashboard.  <br>00:23:00.610 I'll refresh it a few times. And ohthere it is. Register key modified.  <br>00:23:04.540 How killer is that? Now you may bewondering, okay, big deal Chuck,  <br>00:23:07.870 I'll barely even know there.But when does registry is,  <br>00:23:09.615 why do I care if it'schanged? And first of all,  <br>00:23:11.260 the registry like has these settingsfor the configuration of your operating  <br>00:23:14.620 system. So if things are changedhere, it's changing everywhere else.  <br>00:23:17.860 Some common things you might seechanged, especially with malware.  <br>00:23:20.530 Is this key here? Does it seem MicrosoftWindows? Where's it at? Where's it at?  <br>00:23:25.450 Windows Current version. There'sa lot of keys in here man.  <br>00:23:28.480 And we have run and runonce these keys are changed,  <br>00:23:31.630 when you add like a new startupapplication for your system.  <br>00:23:33.910 So what malware will do is I'll go inhere and add a new key new string value.  <br>00:23:37.810 Call this, I'll call this bad stuff andI'll just say internet explorer .  <br>00:23:42.705 Let's, let's copy that location.Okay? And looking back at Waza,  <br>00:23:46.580 it does monitor that by default. Andhere in the events, if I refresh it,  <br>00:23:50.180 there it is. Registerkey added and modified.  <br>00:23:53.090 There's the name of it right there. Badstuff. That's pretty powerful, right?  <br>00:23:56.600 The next thing I wanna show you actions.They're so powerful. Check this out.  <br>00:24:00.530 Let's go to our agents here and I'lljump into my Linux machine here.  <br>00:24:04.070 Circs Network, Chuck. Now let's go tosecurity events and I'll jump to events.  <br>00:24:07.730 Now there'll be a lot of eventshere because this machine's public.  <br>00:24:10.010 Now I'm getting things like attemptto log in using a non-existent user.  <br>00:24:13.430 Getting Bruteforce from Russia usingthe user name Pie . That's funny.  <br>00:24:18.230 Anyways, we can do something with that.And actually I wanna try it myself.  <br>00:24:21.800 I'm gonna try in brute force,  <br>00:24:23.030 I'm gonna launch my Callie Linux machinehere and I'll use hydro to brute force  <br>00:24:26.270 the login and I'll use theusername, uh, Bernard Hack.  <br>00:24:29.185 Well and we'll see ifit sees us. Ready, set,  <br>00:24:32.150 go after a pseudo password. Herewe go. Okay, it's attacking.  <br>00:24:36.530 We should see a log. Let's go look atthe logs here. Security events. Events.  <br>00:24:40.760 This happened just now. Let'ssee if it was us. Use your name.  <br>00:24:44.330 Bernard Hack Wall. So there,there we are. How cool was that?  <br>00:24:46.910 Let's stop that nonsense. Let's realquick. See if I try to log into it. Okay,  <br>00:24:51.565 so I, I'm getting a passwordprompt so I'm not being blocked.  <br>00:24:53.960 So clearly I can sit here and just tryand try and try again to my heart's  <br>00:24:57.410 content.  <br>00:24:57.950 But what if I had our seam activelyrespond to that and add it to the block  <br>00:25:02.450 list, drop it, add it to the firewall.We can do that. Check it out.  <br>00:25:05.750 It's called active response, whichcan be used for so many things.  <br>00:25:08.480 But I wanna demo this realquick. Now, to change this,  <br>00:25:10.490 we're gonna go to theconfiguration of our was a server.  <br>00:25:13.040 So we're gonna go here to the was a menu,  <br>00:25:14.480 go to management and thenclick on configuration.  <br>00:25:17.150 From here we're gonna go to the topright and click on edit configuration.  <br>00:25:20.420 And we're gonna scroll down a bit untilwe see a section called active response.  <br>00:25:24.170 Actually, you know, why am I tripping?I'm just gonna search for it.  <br>00:25:25.910 Active response. Cool, thereit is. Active response.  <br>00:25:28.670 So scroll down a bit untilI see this right here.  <br>00:25:31.520 It's kinda giving you a formatfor what it should look like.  <br>00:25:33.980 And I'm gonna copy this config fromthe documentation. Thank you Waza.  <br>00:25:37.940 Check it out here. Command is firewall,drop location, the server. It's uh,  <br>00:25:42.355 the rule is executing on and then it'sgonna look at a rule or it's looking for  <br>00:25:45.355 a rule. This rule is whattriggers this firewall drop.  <br>00:25:48.140 Now when we tried to brute force whatrule was triggered? Let's go find out.  <br>00:25:51.620 I'm gonna jump to uh, ouragents. Go back to my circ Circs,  <br>00:25:54.980 go to security Events. Events andlet's see, it was just earlier, right?  <br>00:25:58.675 Like at 33. Yeah. So here's the alert.You can see yes, it was Bernard Hack.  <br>00:26:02.780 Well and there's the alert IDright there. The rule ID 57 10.  <br>00:26:07.130 That's what we want it to alert off of.  <br>00:26:08.780 So let's go back to our configurationthing here and we'll change that rule from  <br>00:26:12.590 57 63 to 57 10 and this willtime it out or add the firewall  <br>00:26:17.360 rule. And the time outhere is 180 seconds.  <br>00:26:19.610 It'll block the attacker for 180seconds. Pretty cool. So let's save that.  <br>00:26:23.540 Click on save, restart our manager. Justgive that a little, little bit of time.  <br>00:26:27.380 Here're starting, please wait,coffee break. Okay, it's restarted.  <br>00:26:31.790 Now what we wanna do nowis go back to our agent,  <br>00:26:33.710 go back to Search network Chuck andwe'll go to security events and go to  <br>00:26:37.760 events. So last thing we saw agentstarted and stopped. Refresh that. Okay,  <br>00:26:41.570 we're here now let's go and tryto brute force it one more time.  <br>00:26:44.100 Actually real quickly, see if we canlog in. So this time I'm gonna use Root.  <br>00:26:46.980 I know a real user on that system.Let's see if it lets me. Okay, so we're,  <br>00:26:50.460 it's allowing us right now. Nowwe don't have to brute force.  <br>00:26:53.070 We can just try to login with Bernard Hack.  <br>00:26:54.630 Well what that should do is trigger.Now it's right now it's 1203.  <br>00:26:57.870 It should trigger that new activerule. Let's go see. Bam. There it is.  <br>00:27:02.190 So 1203 attempt. Attempt to log inwith non-existent user. Bernard Hack.  <br>00:27:06.120 Well immediately the firewall at dropactive response blocks me. So now,  <br>00:27:10.890 right now for 180 secondsanyway, if I even try to log in,  <br>00:27:14.105 even with a real user, Iget nothing. I'm blocked.  <br>00:27:18.570 I can't even ping it., it's kinda crazy.  <br>00:27:21.210 Let's do a continuous ping and see whenit lets me out outta jail here. Oh,  <br>00:27:25.500 we're back. We're back. Okay, so howcool is that? And just so you know,  <br>00:27:28.710 you can do those active responses basedon a variety of rules. It's so custom.  <br>00:27:33.095 That's why this is so powerful.  <br>00:27:34.350 You can even do it off of like a certaincommand was run or a certain log came  <br>00:27:38.670 about in, in the system you can run aa, an active response. It's so crazy.  <br>00:27:43.740 Now two more things I wanna show youreal quick. First is vulnerabilities. Um,  <br>00:27:47.280 right now if I go to my search network,Chuck and I go to Vulnerabilities.  <br>00:27:51.300 Nothing there. Why? Becauseit's not enabled by default.  <br>00:27:54.270 The system does not search for that. Soit's really, really easy to set this up.  <br>00:27:57.750 We'll go to waza management configuration.  <br>00:27:59.940 Just like before we'llgo to edit configuration.  <br>00:28:02.070 And here we're gonna search forvulnerability detector. Right there.  <br>00:28:06.605 It tells us enabled. No,let's change that to yes,  <br>00:28:10.680 we definitely want that. Then we clickon save and restart Manager, confirm now.  <br>00:28:15.000 So once this restarts, noticethe options it has here.  <br>00:28:17.880 It'll run a full scan every six hours.  <br>00:28:19.680 It'll also run on Start when the servicestarts up. So once this finishes,  <br>00:28:24.090 we'll restart our service and Windowsand Linux and see what happens. Okay,  <br>00:28:27.815 cool. It's done there.I'm gonna go to Windows,  <br>00:28:30.030 restart my service here andwe're restart my service here.  <br>00:28:32.550 I restarting was at Agents.Cool. So now at this point,  <br>00:28:35.880 and if we check our agents, I'lljust go to my Windows machine here,  <br>00:28:38.340 go to vulnerabilities. Cool. Soscan's complete, didn't find anything.  <br>00:28:42.210 Now the reason for that is that my Windowsmachine has like no apps installed on  <br>00:28:45.660 it,  <br>00:28:45.750 but just know to enable the vulnerabilityscanning you have to enable it on the  <br>00:28:49.470 system, on the Waza server. But theagents have that configured by default.  <br>00:28:53.250 Now if I go back to my other server thathas all kinds of fun stuff configured,  <br>00:28:57.300 I gotta get logged back in here.Chloe, she has a bad version of vlc,  <br>00:29:00.990 media player, high severity cde.Wow, look at that, dude, this is fun.  <br>00:29:05.520 Gives you all the details ofit. Oh my gosh, it's so cool.  <br>00:29:08.280 But I wouldn't have known that if Ididn't have this on her system and it just  <br>00:29:11.340 tells me automatically.  <br>00:29:12.780 Now speaking of telling you automaticallyyou'll need some sort of alert, right?  <br>00:29:16.740 Waza has that. They've gotemail alerts and Slack alerts.  <br>00:29:19.380 I'm gonna show you Slack realquick. How to set that up.  <br>00:29:21.570 The first one I'll do is open on Slackand create a new channel just for waza  <br>00:29:25.170 Waza alerts.  <br>00:29:27.870 Now I'll go out to Slackand create a new app.  <br>00:29:30.990 Now this will not be a tutorialon how Slack apps work.  <br>00:29:33.870 I'll just walk you through the basicsyou need to know about right now.  <br>00:29:35.970 And this goes without sayingyou do need a Slack account.  <br>00:29:39.270 So I'll click on create new appfrom name it was uh, alerts,  <br>00:29:44.080 select my workspace, create the app.  <br>00:29:46.210 And then all I wanna add really isan incoming webhook. Activate it.  <br>00:29:49.300 And then at the bottom I'll clickon add new webhook to workspace.  <br>00:29:52.720 I'll click on new channel WazaAlerts Allow. And that's it.  <br>00:29:56.920 And all I need from this is thiswebhook url. I'll copy that,  <br>00:30:00.250 get back to my Wza dashboard.  <br>00:30:02.440 And I'm gonna go back tothat configuration pagewhere we were at before where  <br>00:30:04.660 we spent a lot of time. Clickon Wza, go to management,  <br>00:30:07.395 and then go to configuration. Same thingas before. Click on edit configuration.  <br>00:30:10.900 And here I'm gonna search forintegrations or just integration.  <br>00:30:15.340 And it looks like I don't have asection for that. I'll just add it here.  <br>00:30:18.130 So I'll just go to the top and just underglobal and I'll paste this config from  <br>00:30:22.330 the documentation.  <br>00:30:23.440 The only thing I'll change hereis pasting my webhook right there,  <br>00:30:26.230 which I need to copyagain, paste it there.  <br>00:30:28.360 And actually there is one more thing Iwanna change just in case you don't wanna  <br>00:30:30.975 be killed with alerts because this default setting will have a bunch of  <br>00:30:35.470 alerts sent to me basedon like all the events.  <br>00:30:37.840 And of course you can change the severitylevel of events that are sent to you  <br>00:30:41.260 or even just specify a specific ruleID you're looking for. So for example,  <br>00:30:46.000 right underneath here I can addrule id. And what do you say we do?  <br>00:30:50.110 57 10. That same rule as earlier that weare doing the action roll off of. Cool.  <br>00:30:54.850 So we have our web hook in place,  <br>00:30:56.260 the url we have our rule to alert offof Save it, save and restart manager.  <br>00:31:00.610 Once that is restarted, we'll doour little test here in a moment.  <br>00:31:03.070 And real quick, look, there'snothing in the uh, waza alerts yet.  <br>00:31:06.250 It's kind of quiet here.Cool, it's restarted.  <br>00:31:08.320 Now let's try and log in withBernard Hack. Well again,  <br>00:31:13.900 that should block us. Andthen over here, BAM was alert.  <br>00:31:18.105 Actually hit my watch too. Was I alert?Look at that invalid user. Bernard Hack.  <br>00:31:22.690 Well, from this IP address, which I'mgonna have Nick or Austin block right now,  <br>00:31:27.610 that's awesome, right?

(it's safe)  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/ey4u7OUAF3c](https://www.youtube.com/watch/ey4u7OUAF3c)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.090 In this video we're going to exposeyour home network to the internet.  <br>00:00:04.440 Now don't be scary.  <br>00:00:05.280 This is completely secure and kind ofcrazy actually cuz we're not punching  <br>00:00:09.520 holes through your firewall,  <br>00:00:10.520 which is what you might do with areverse proxy like engine X or traffic  <br>00:00:13.560 forwarding and exposing ports 80and 4 43. Now we're not doing that.  <br>00:00:17.760 Instead we're creating a tunnel.  <br>00:00:19.440 And with this tunnel we cansecurely expose anythingon your home network to the  <br>00:00:24.640 internet, a website, prox,walk Porter, anything.  <br>00:00:27.800 And I'm telling you this is nuts.  <br>00:00:29.320 Everything you expose will haveits own sub-domain and SSL cert.  <br>00:00:33.560 Even if you only have a ACTTP or a self-signed cert,  <br>00:00:36.560 we're setting up CloudFlare Tunnel afree service that allows you to connect  <br>00:00:40.360 securely to your home networkresources from anywhere.  <br>00:00:43.200 And it doesn't matter whatkind of home network you have,  <br>00:00:45.320 I know some of you your is P sucks andyou got CG nat and all that doesn't  <br>00:00:49.600 matter, this will work. Settingthis up is super simple.  <br>00:00:52.280 It'll only take a few sip ofcoffee. Here's what you need.  <br>00:00:55.710 Coffee being one of those things.First you will need a domain name.  <br>00:00:58.560 I'm gonna set up one realquick with Google [Domains.It](http://domains.it/)'s about 12 bucks a year.  <br>00:01:01.800 It's just the cost ofdoing business. Second,  <br>00:01:03.640 you'll need a computer or server insideyour home network and this can be  <br>00:01:07.640 running pretty much any OS and um,I think you might have one, right?  <br>00:01:10.640 And it's on this computer or server thatwill install CloudFlare Tunnel and then  <br>00:01:14.560 it will tunnel out to CloudFlare andit's through that tunnel that we can tell  <br>00:01:17.720 CloudFlare to route pretty much anysub-domain to anything inside our home  <br>00:01:21.960 network, SSL cert and all. And yeah,that's pretty much all you need.  <br>00:01:24.920 Let's get our coffee and getstarted. But before we get started,  <br>00:01:27.560 I wanna talk about this,  <br>00:01:28.740 the computer or server that you're usingin your home network. And like I said,  <br>00:01:32.400 anything will work.  <br>00:01:33.100 But I want you to try and start usingRed Hat Enterprise Linux or Rel Rel.  <br>00:01:37.560 Rel Rel Red Hat is the sponsor of thisvideo making this video happen And I've  <br>00:01:41.760 recently started using Red Hat Enterpriselinnux and My Home Network. But why?  <br>00:01:46.220 Two reasons. Number one,  <br>00:01:47.520 red Hat Enterprise linnux is the flavorof linnux at enterprise companies use.  <br>00:01:51.520 You know the big companiesthat you may want to work for,  <br>00:01:53.960 they use the stuff and for a lot ofreasons, reliable, secure, standardized.  <br>00:01:57.840 It's the gold standard if youwant to run Lennox professionally,  <br>00:02:00.640 enterprise Lee in your network.  <br>00:02:03.220 But it's also not free usually.  <br>00:02:05.870 I've got a little surprisefor you here in a bit.  <br>00:02:07.640 Now getting back to the point 0.1 thatit's used by enterprise companies.  <br>00:02:11.000 Why do you care?  <br>00:02:11.870 Well for me the point of having a homelab doing all the stuff in my crazy  <br>00:02:15.640 office is to get hands on experiencewith enterprise IT stuff so I can learn  <br>00:02:19.640 skills that make me more valuable.  <br>00:02:20.880 So a company might hire me to dothe stuff I'm doing in my house.  <br>00:02:23.650 So it just makes sense if companiesare using Red Hat Enterprise Linux,  <br>00:02:27.120 the companies that may hire you one day,  <br>00:02:29.050 it makes sense to put thatinside your home network,  <br>00:02:31.240 inside your home laband learn how to use it.  <br>00:02:34.050 So maybe you can put on your resume,Hey I run this stuff at home now.  <br>00:02:37.560 Number two, why you might want to useit, why you should use it right now.  <br>00:02:40.040 If you're a company it's not free, butif you're you an individual, a person,  <br>00:02:45.070 make sure you check that I'm not a robotthing. Do a puzzle. Okay, you're good.  <br>00:02:48.560 You can sign up for Red Hat'sdeveloper for individual subscription,  <br>00:02:51.880 which includes a free versionof Red Hat Enterprise Lennox,  <br>00:02:55.240 and not just a free version. You canactually license up to 16 servers.  <br>00:02:58.680 And those servers can be asbeefy as you want them to be.  <br>00:03:01.240 So all you have to do right now ischeck my link in the description,  <br>00:03:03.600 get signed up and once you're loggedin you can check out your subscription.  <br>00:03:06.440 There's mine right here. I'veonly used one server so far.  <br>00:03:09.040 And to download your Red Hat EnterpriseLinux, go to downloads at the top Lyft,  <br>00:03:12.760 there it is right there.  <br>00:03:13.680 Click on the little icon here and saydownload latest and I'll grab that 9.1  <br>00:03:17.680 right now. The one thing I love about Rel,  <br>00:03:19.560 that's how the cool kits say it is theyhave a web console for your server,  <br>00:03:23.080 which is a beautiful gooey that allowsme to manage pretty much everything about  <br>00:03:26.680 my server, including containersrunning on that thing.  <br>00:03:29.810 So if you wanna run your homelab like an enterprise company,  <br>00:03:32.280 check out Red HatEnterprise Linux link below.  <br>00:03:34.720 That's what I'm gonna use rightnow to set up my CloudFlare Tunnel.  <br>00:03:37.280 I'm gonna head out to Google Domainsby Googling domains. We're here.  <br>00:03:40.600 I would like to get a new domain soI'll click on that search for man,  <br>00:03:44.360 what should it be?

Click continue.  <br>00:04:21.899 Now no matter what domainprovider you're using,  <br>00:04:23.960 you'll need to use CloudFlare asyour name servers. How do we do that?  <br>00:04:27.320 I'm gonna show you rightnow. So here on this page,  <br>00:04:29.280 I'm gonna scroll down justa bit and click continue.  <br>00:04:31.360 And right here on step four,our Cloudflare's name server,  <br>00:04:34.920 whatever you have there,you'll use both of these.  <br>00:04:36.320 So I'm gonna jump backover to Google Domains,  <br>00:04:38.120 click on DNS and using my eyeballs,  <br>00:04:40.840 I'm gonna try and find custom nameservers. There it is right there.  <br>00:04:44.070 I wanna change my nameServers to something custom.Here we go. Copy Clarissa.  <br>00:04:47.760 Clarissa explains it all.Copy Evan. Click on save.  <br>00:04:50.480 And then Google's kind of tricky.  <br>00:04:51.720 You have to click on switchto these settings at the top.  <br>00:04:53.680 Once you do that and we're done. Nowthis could take a moment. They say,  <br>00:04:56.320 oh it can take up the 24 [hours.It](http://hours.it/) rarely does. It might though,  <br>00:04:59.570 so like don't get mad at me. Mineusually takes like a few moments.  <br>00:05:03.250 So getting back to CloudFlare,  <br>00:05:04.440 I'll click on done check name serversand I'll click on finish later for this,  <br>00:05:07.480 I'll do it later and I'll click oncheck name servers once more. Come on,  <br>00:05:10.160 really check it now it should reflecthere and you'll also receive an email  <br>00:05:13.160 telling you, hey it [happened.So](http://happened.so/) we'll give that a moment.  <br>00:05:15.560 Coffee break and lookat that. Mine is done.  <br>00:05:17.720 Took a little less than five minutesso not too bad time for step three,  <br>00:05:21.160 set up our CloudFlare tunnelhere in CloudFlare land.  <br>00:05:24.240 We're gonna scroll down just a bit onthe side panel and click on zero trust  <br>00:05:27.880 because you can't trust anyone exceptfor me.

Elon Musk Comb Lap.  <br>00:05:46.910 Next again, scary pagewhere you're like, Chuck,  <br>00:05:48.880 I thought you said this was free and itis. It's just over here. Hidden kind of.  <br>00:05:51.760 I want the free plan.  <br>00:05:52.520 I'm selecting that Proceed to paymentof zero while they have to use that  <br>00:05:55.560 language. Now even though it is $0,  <br>00:05:57.840 it still doesn't want a payment on filesimilar to AWS and but it shouldn't  <br>00:06:01.880 charge you anything cuzagain, zero is zero, right?  <br>00:06:04.240 So let's click on next and then clickon purchase for our $0 purchase. Okay,  <br>00:06:08.720 we're good. Now we canactually click on tunnels.  <br>00:06:10.970 So let's get back to access and tunnelsand let's create our first tunnel.  <br>00:06:14.400 This is so crazy. Click on Create tunnel.  <br>00:06:16.480 Let's name it ElonMusk's House Save tunnel.  <br>00:06:20.180 And this is stupid easy. I told you youcould pretty much install this anywhere.  <br>00:06:23.840 They have all the flavors. Myfavorite flavor is gonna be Docker,  <br>00:06:27.120 but whatever you got,  <br>00:06:28.150 just click on these guys andI'll have the code you can run.  <br>00:06:30.680 So I'll click on Docker and I'll copythis snippet of code right here and here  <br>00:06:34.040 on my Red Hat Enterprise Linux machinewith Docker installed. Let's make sure,  <br>00:06:38.140 yes, I'm going to paste that code,  <br>00:06:40.280 although I will make one change herewhen I control A to get my cursor to the  <br>00:06:43.360 very beginning and just after a run,  <br>00:06:45.000 I'm gonna add a dash D for Damon soit runs in the background and then hit  <br>00:06:49.040 enter. Done. It's running sun. Now I getback to my cloud flare dashboard here.  <br>00:06:53.080 I'll click on next and time to routemy first service. So check this out,  <br>00:06:56.760 I'll do my proxima server first. SoI'll do prox mos, select my domain,  <br>00:07:00.280 which I already have set up Elon muskhome [lab.com](http://lab.com/). I'll select my service type,  <br>00:07:04.120 which will be HTTPS S for prox max.  <br>00:07:06.960 And then the internal privateIP address to my prox max server  <br>00:07:10.260 10 77, 73 port 8,006.  <br>00:07:14.660 Now you can see that CloudFlare Tunnelis acting kind of as a reverse proxy,  <br>00:07:18.670 except it's not exposing your homenetwork to the big bad internet.  <br>00:07:22.920 Insecurely unsecurely. It's safe.  <br>00:07:25.120 Now for services like Prox mos thathave self science certificates,  <br>00:07:28.110 I wanna click on additionalapplication settings.  <br>00:07:30.360 And under TLS I can say no TLSVerify. So it'll be okay with that.  <br>00:07:35.040 Then click on save Elon Musk'shouse tunnel and boom. So right now,  <br>00:07:39.000 a bunch of cool things happening.First, my tunnel is active.  <br>00:07:42.040 That means that whatever I did onmy Red Hat enterprise Lennox server,  <br>00:07:44.590 it's working. We're connected. I didn'thave to do anything to my firewall.  <br>00:07:47.950 I didn't have to really do much copy andpaste. You can do that. I can do that.  <br>00:07:52.200 It's awesome. Okay, anyways,so let's test it out.  <br>00:07:55.040 I'm gonna navigate out tocrocs mos dot elon musk home  <br>00:07:59.360 [lab.com](http://lab.com/) and it, it's working ,  <br>00:08:03.980 how cool is that? I'm logged in. Let'stry a connection from the outside.  <br>00:08:07.120 I'm gonna launch my chasm workspacehere, which is hosted in LE node.  <br>00:08:10.400 Open up a brave browser,  <br>00:08:11.600 which is outside my home network andI'll do the same thing I'm in and all the  <br>00:08:15.440 products mock stuff worksflawlessly. Check this out.  <br>00:08:17.800 One thing that doesn't work great withEngine X and traffic without a lot of  <br>00:08:22.680 work is the console. It works greathere. Now looking back at CloudFlare,  <br>00:08:26.400 all we need is that one tunnel foreverything. So if I click on configure,  <br>00:08:29.910 I can add more public hostnames. Let's add another one.  <br>00:08:32.720 Let's add my Sonology nass.  <br>00:08:34.159 So I'll just do NASS elonmusk home [lab.com](http://lab.com/) type HTS URL  <br>00:08:39.289 on port 5,001. I'll make surethere's no TLS Verify save host name.  <br>00:08:43.679 Let's test it out. Nas dot elon musk [homelab.com](http://homelab.com/) and look at that . How,  <br>00:08:47.760 how easy was that?  <br>00:08:48.990 I don't have to worry about let's encryptcertificates or really just anything.  <br>00:08:53.170 It just, it just works. And there's thatbeautiful SSL shirt right there, man.  <br>00:08:57.960 Now you gotta admit that's the easiestway you've seen to expose your home  <br>00:09:02.000 network's resources tothe internet. I mean,  <br>00:09:04.040 just a few clicks and you can host yourown website on a raspberry pie inside  <br>00:09:07.720 your house no matter whattype of network you have,  <br>00:09:09.660 and people can securely access it.CloudFlare is changing the game.  <br>00:09:12.900 Let me know if you, um, hacked to YouTubetoday that like boat notification,  <br>00:09:16.640 bell comment, subscribe. You gotta hackYouTube today ethically, of course.  <br>00:09:19.960 And for real, just let me know belowif you did this and how cool it is.  <br>00:09:23.680 I just wanna, I wanna geek out with you,so get some coffee and let's geek out.|### SUMMARY  <br>Me presenting a video on exposing home networks securely to the internet using CloudFlare Tunnel.  <br>  <br>### IDEAS:  <br>- Exposing your home

(Docker Containers STREAMING Kali Linux to your browser)  <br># [https://www.youtube.com/watch/U7e-mcJdZok](https://www.youtube.com/watch/U7e-mcJdZok)  <br>  <br>00:00:00.030 What I'm about to show you is theultimate hacking workspace. No joke.  <br>00:00:03.910 This technology is nuts. Andhonestly, I use this thing every day.  <br>00:00:08.200 Change the game for me,completely like check this out.  <br>00:00:10.520 I may be researching hacking stuff, andthere's some sketchy links out there.  <br>00:00:13.080 But with one click,  <br>00:00:18.750 just like that, a new browseropen, but it's isolated, secure.  <br>00:00:22.390 Heck it's not even on my [machine.Is](http://machine.is/) it a bad link? I don't care.  <br>00:00:25.890 Not my machine or maybe I want a fresh,  <br>00:00:27.550 clean and sense of call Lennoxfor some quick hacking or testing.  <br>00:00:30.340 Boom right here in my browser seconds.And when I'm done, boom, blow it up.  <br>00:00:34.350 Like it never existed.  <br>00:00:35.330 Or maybe a spin up two and have 'em attackeach other Cali and Navy U boom too.  <br>00:00:39.210 And no, this doesn't involve some heavyvirtual machines or WSL two it's Docker  <br>00:00:43.540 containers streaming to yourbrowser. What, in the best part,  <br>00:00:47.480 I'm gonna show you how to setthis up in about five minutes.  <br>00:00:50.120 Me and Cameron are hi. That's mybrother. It could be in the cloud.  <br>00:00:52.700 It could be in your house. And myfavorite part, it's completely free.  <br>00:00:55.900 Thanks to our sponsor. Chasm [workspaces.So](http://workspaces.so/) get you coffee ready or tea.  <br>00:00:59.900 If you're a loser, shut up. Let's do this.  <br>00:01:04.110 So end up talking.  <br>00:01:05.050 Let's talk about what you needto actually get this thing going.  <br>00:01:07.110 The list is not long. That's the goodnews. Cameron tell 'em what we need. Oh,  <br>00:01:12.130 I was not ready for this. nowall you pretty much need is a server,  <br>00:01:15.650 which might sound scary, but it'sjust a small server. That's it?  <br>00:01:18.170 Cameron tell 'em what we need. Go ahead.  <br>00:01:24.560 I know you're staring at me. So hereare the minimum survey requirements.  <br>00:01:27.330 We're gonna be two VCPS, four gigsof Ram and 50 gigabytes of storage,  <br>00:01:32.700 SSD preferred. And this applies to cloudor OnPrem, which could be your house.  <br>00:01:36.540 But we're gonna show you both. Thanks,Cameron. got my chair. See how,  <br>00:01:40.640 what Cameron set. That's prettymuch it. Well, one more thing.  <br>00:01:43.330 You gotta have coffee, everything init requires coffee or tea. Shut up.  <br>00:01:46.870 Never Chuck duck coffee.Now I know you're ready.  <br>00:01:48.790 I know you're itching to get starteddoing this, but first, before we do that,  <br>00:01:51.910 I wanna talk about the magic behindhow this actually works. Now,  <br>00:01:54.710 if you don't care about that,go ahead and skip forward.  <br>00:01:56.230 I got time stamps below,but chasm is so cool. I, I,  <br>00:02:00.230 I think I just wanna tellyou about it. Actually.  <br>00:02:01.590 I don't wanna tell you about it. Cameron'sgonna tell you about how chasm works,  <br>00:02:04.800 how the magic of Docker containerstreaming to your browser  <br>00:02:09.630 works. I said works a lot.Anyways. Cameron saved me.  <br>00:02:13.380 here's how chasm works. Soyou install chasm on your server. Now,  <br>00:02:16.340 if you wanna open up a secure web browser,  <br>00:02:17.760 or even an instance of call Linux chasmwill automatically open this up in a  <br>00:02:21.260 Docker container and streamit to your browser. He works.  <br>00:02:23.700 Isn't that cool camerabe more excited anyways.  <br>00:02:27.070 And it does this using chasmsproprietary software called chasm B,  <br>00:02:30.900 which is it's it's open [source.It](http://source.it/)'s open source. There we go.  <br>00:02:36.010 oh yeah. One thing.Camera move. Gimme your pen.  <br>00:02:38.850 So these Docker containersare just regular containers.  <br>00:02:41.440 They're actually on Docker hub andyou can just pull them from there.  <br>00:02:44.920 You can go look at 'em and you can evencreate your own custom Docker images,  <br>00:02:48.560 container things.Anyways, here you go. Oh,  <br>00:02:50.880 also also think about the start camera.One way is you can put it in the cloud.  <br>00:02:53.320 We're gonna show you how to do that.This is my cloud. Shut up camera.  <br>00:02:55.900 And whenever you're surfing the internetor doing some hacking stuff in Cali,  <br>00:02:59.540 um, you're using theclouds IP address. So,  <br>00:03:02.760 whereas normally you'd be going directlyto your ISP using your home internet IP  <br>00:03:06.840 address using chasm. You'rekind of hiding yourself a bit,  <br>00:03:10.250 especially from your ISP, keepingyourself a bit anonymous and you,  <br>00:03:13.540 you could be anywhere you could be atStarbucks drinking, coffee or tea .  <br>00:03:17.820 So,  <br>00:03:18.040 because you're chasm server is installedon your business network or your home  <br>00:03:21.510 network, you have access to everythingthat is on your network. Like,  <br>00:03:24.910 think about that cameranot being excited enough.  <br>00:03:26.530 You have access to your Sonology insideyour home network or all that stuff.  <br>00:03:29.430 Like just all your stuff, your,  <br>00:03:30.790 all your other home lab stuff remotelythrough dock container streaming,  <br>00:03:34.070 just magic, magic, magic. Butthat's the basic of how chasm works.  <br>00:03:37.170 But now you wanna set it up, but I'llhave Chuck walk you through that. Yeah,  <br>00:03:41.020 yeah. Hear you tea drinking. Wooy allright. nothing wrong with tea,  <br>00:03:45.400 but you know, coffee's better. Okay.  <br>00:03:47.300 Now time to actually installchasm on our server, uh,  <br>00:03:50.260 like Cameron was talking about, he justtook freaking forever to explain it.  <br>00:03:53.120 I'm just kidding. He did a greatjob. Let us know how he did guys.  <br>00:03:55.400 If you wanna see more of Cameron, ifyou don't, we're gonna show him anyway.  <br>00:03:58.400 Now we mentioned that we can installall this pretty much anywhere,  <br>00:04:01.030 but the two I'm gonna show youis the cloud. And then, uh,  <br>00:04:03.950 OnPrim AKA your houseor your business. Now,  <br>00:04:06.490 thankfully the differencebetween the two is not a lot.  <br>00:04:08.810 It's pretty much the same, but let'sfocus on the cloud first. Now, you know,  <br>00:04:11.490 my favorite cloud provider,  <br>00:04:12.430 my favorite thing to do and use is Linodemainly because if you've never used  <br>00:04:16.610 'em before you get a hundred dollarsfree credit right now to sign up.  <br>00:04:19.510 So you much get to try this out for [free.So](http://free.so/) just shut up and do it link below.  <br>00:04:24.060 So with your Len node account setup,  <br>00:04:25.570 we'll first go to create at the topleft and, uh, well create, click on it,  <br>00:04:30.060 create a Len node from here.  <br>00:04:31.600 We're just gonna do our best to meetthe minimum requirements. First,  <br>00:04:34.060 the images we're gonna rock UbuntuUbuntu 20 0 4. Don't use 21.  <br>00:04:39.560 yeah, he's right. I tried 21did not work 20 0 4 El least. That's at,  <br>00:04:43.470 at the time of this recording,I'm losing my mind anyways,  <br>00:04:45.790 too much coffee already.  <br>00:04:46.470 How you doing T boy we'll then selectour regions somewhere close to you.  <br>00:04:49.150 And then for the plan, this is wherethe minimum requirements come in. Um,  <br>00:04:51.830 dedicated. I don't need that. Idon't have that kind of money.  <br>00:04:53.890 I'm doing shared CPU. And the minimumrequirement will be this guy right here.  <br>00:04:57.120 Leino for gigabits orbites. Sorry, not bits.  <br>00:04:59.630 Four gigs of delicious Ram over arehere. And then two virtual CPUs.  <br>00:05:03.080 And we got plenty of hard repspace. Cause the minimum is 50 gigs.  <br>00:05:05.840 So this satisfies ourminimum requirements.  <br>00:05:08.010 Then I'll label it my chasm password.  <br>00:05:12.120 And that's pretty much it I'llclick on create Lin node. No, yeah,  <br>00:05:14.940 20 bucks a month.  <br>00:05:15.760 That's not the $5 a month we'renormally doing with these projects.  <br>00:05:18.360 That's because chasm is extra cooland require some extra, extra stuff.  <br>00:05:22.470 Now also keep in mind, I'm showingyou Le node. You can do this in AWS,  <br>00:05:25.890 digital ocean,  <br>00:05:26.610 pretty much any cloud provider thatcan produce virtual machines for you,  <br>00:05:29.490 which is all of [them.It](http://them.it/)'ll work now for on-prem.  <br>00:05:32.320 This will vary based onwhat you're using for me.  <br>00:05:34.450 I got prox Mo and all I'll do is createa VM. Make sure I'm doing UBO 2 20 0 4.  <br>00:05:38.170 Make sure my hard driveis at least 50 gigs.  <br>00:05:39.690 I go and throw like maybe75 at it for no reason,  <br>00:05:42.780 two virtual CPUs and four gigsRam. Again, this may vary for you,  <br>00:05:46.700 but that's pretty much the gist. Okay.Back to the node. Once yours is running,  <br>00:05:49.830 it's done provisioning.  <br>00:05:50.770 Let's go ahead and grab thisIP address and get logged in.  <br>00:05:53.080 Or you can copy the one over here.  <br>00:05:54.230 Copy launch your favorite terminalprogram on the windows. So I've got CMD,  <br>00:05:58.210 it'll be terminal on Mac and [Lennox.It](http://lennox.it/)'ll be SSH route at your IP address,  <br>00:06:01.900 hit enter fingerprints. Yep. And thenenter your password that you set earlier.  <br>00:06:05.370 We're in now the installation of chasmis actually the easiest part of this  <br>00:06:08.320 entire tutorial. So easy that I feelcomfortable letting Cameron do it. So, uh,  <br>00:06:12.020 go ahead, cam. All right.  <br>00:06:12.840 So the first thing we're gonna do hereis actually for stability and we're going  <br>00:06:16.100 to get a swap partition.  <br>00:06:17.590 We're gonna put in this first commandto actually create the swap partition.  <br>00:06:20.960 We're gonna upgrade the permissions,actually make it into swap.  <br>00:06:24.370 And then we're gonna turnon the swap partition.  <br>00:06:26.360 These four commands are gonnabe below in the description.  <br>00:06:28.810 You could actually just copy and pastethese in and make the swap partition.  <br>00:06:31.410 And just to make sure that wemade our swap successfully,  <br>00:06:34.130 we can use the cat command to look insideof the swap file. And I can see here,  <br>00:06:38.520 we have our swap partition now to makesure that our swap will come back.  <br>00:06:42.460 Whenever there is a reboot, let'sgo ahead and just run this command.  <br>00:06:44.800 And this will add this to the Fs tab file.  <br>00:06:47.160 Now that we have theswap partition set up,  <br>00:06:49.400 we can now download the installationfile using the w get command.  <br>00:06:53.680 And you can see we're actually gettingthis from S3, go ahead and enter and,  <br>00:06:57.550 and let's get that downloaded.  <br>00:06:58.950 And now let's just run an LS realquick just to make sure that the file  <br>00:07:01.930 downloaded correctly. So thisfile is in the dot GZ format.  <br>00:07:05.590 So we will need to unzip this inorder to get the installation file.  <br>00:07:08.950 So let's paste that command in thereand that will extract it to our current  <br>00:07:12.210 directory. And we can now see thechasm release folders right there.  <br>00:07:16.480 Then we will do pseudo bash and thatwill just run this installation script.  <br>00:07:20.510 Then they'll want us to accept the enduser license agreement, just hit yes.  <br>00:07:24.140 And enter. And this installation'sgonna take a little bit,  <br>00:07:26.500 so go take a coffee break. We'llget back to it in a second, man.  <br>00:07:29.640 Those are pretty fast install.Wasn't it? Yeah, I'm kidding.  <br>00:07:32.340 Now on our screen here, uh, theygive us some credentials. Uh,  <br>00:07:35.640 the only really important ones herefor us are gonna be the admin one.  <br>00:07:38.560 Let's go ahead and grab 'em all just incase and just paste these into a note.  <br>00:07:41.770 And once you have that past it away,  <br>00:07:42.840 let's get back to Le node andlet's copy our IP address,  <br>00:07:46.220 open up a new tab and let'sdo HTT PS call slash slash and  <br>00:07:50.990 let's paste in the IP address ofour ode hit advanced and proceed.  <br>00:07:55.010 And now let's paste in this credentialsthat we saved a second ago, right?  <br>00:07:57.790 When you log in, you'll be presentedwith the chasm console. Uh,  <br>00:08:00.700 the first place they log youinto here is the admin portion.  <br>00:08:03.920 So you'll notice a lot ofsettings and stuff here.  <br>00:08:06.270 We're not gonna get to that right now.We'll go into that later in the video,  <br>00:08:08.970 what we're mainly focused on here,  <br>00:08:10.410 it's just the workspaces portion andthat's where all the fun stuff is.  <br>00:08:13.280 Now we can move over to workspaces andwe're just gonna pick Chrome for this,  <br>00:08:16.290 that launch session andboom, just like that.  <br>00:08:19.570 We have a containerized browser streamingto our computer. All right, Cameron,  <br>00:08:23.110 get on my seat. Yep. That's thebig stuff. That's the basic stuff.  <br>00:08:27.010 and at this pointyou're pretty much done.  <br>00:08:29.130 Like you've got your chasm insulationgoing. You can access your stuff.  <br>00:08:32.330 And if you go back to the actually toget back to let me show you how to do  <br>00:08:34.770 that. When you're sitting herechilling in your instance, here,  <br>00:08:37.419 there are little dots on the left. Look,those dots, you can do a few things.  <br>00:08:40.940 One of the main things we care aboutright now is getting it back to our  <br>00:08:43.000 workspace. Click those four littledots, more, a lot of dots here,  <br>00:08:46.520 and you can launch other stuff.  <br>00:08:47.580 So they've got dedicated apps that againwill just launch a Docker container.  <br>00:08:51.080 But these are apps you can launchright now from G, which is, uh,  <br>00:08:54.760 like drawing stuff like Photoshopoffice, just a terminal.  <br>00:08:57.580 If you want a terminal Ubuntuand even visual studio code,  <br>00:09:00.320 which I'll just launch that realquick is pretty cool. And bam,  <br>00:09:02.400 just like that visual studio codestreaming to me from a Docker container,  <br>00:09:05.720 which still is just, isn't that crazy.  <br>00:09:08.040 a Docker container streamingand shoot even a to browsers,  <br>00:09:11.160 browsing in a browser on a virtualmachine, in the cloud using tour.  <br>00:09:16.370 And it's inside a Docker container.  <br>00:09:17.630 There's so many things happeningwith tech-wise. It's like,  <br>00:09:20.130 it hurts your brain to thinkabout it, how you're doing this.  <br>00:09:22.520 Can't get more secure thanthis or anonymous. Now, again,  <br>00:09:25.750 you're pretty much done. Like you couldleave the video and be happy about this,  <br>00:09:28.810 but you know, we can't end there.There's some more cool things you can do.  <br>00:09:31.310 Like, I don't know if you notice, butwhen we are back in our portal here,  <br>00:09:35.020 click over back on admin dude.  <br>00:09:37.260 this is more than just like atoy we can play with. This is a full,  <br>00:09:41.030 crazy enterprise system tool, which again,  <br>00:09:44.180 it takes 10 years to tell you all thethings it can do and walk through that.  <br>00:09:47.560 But I will show you just a few things.  <br>00:09:49.140 I think you'll love and you'll wannado right now. Camera say right now,  <br>00:09:52.590 right now, now the firstthing you may want.  <br>00:09:54.460 And it's the first thing I wantwas the ability to take like,  <br>00:09:57.010 like remember the intro we had likemaybe nefarious links like this one,  <br>00:10:00.830 you may not wanna open that inyour browser, on your main desktop.  <br>00:10:03.300 There could be all kinds of crazystuff that affect your computer.  <br>00:10:06.430 So we want to be able to right,click that and say open and chasm,  <br>00:10:09.770 open a Docker container. That's safe,secure, and isolated. That won't hurt me.  <br>00:10:13.110 How do we do that? Now? Thisis simply a Chrome extension.  <br>00:10:15.650 And if you name brave or Firefox,I believe they have Firefox.  <br>00:10:18.790 I'll check on brave, but I'msure they have all of it.  <br>00:10:20.560 We're simply gonna add an extension orinstalling extension on our browser.  <br>00:10:23.540 So I'm just gonna look forChrome extension store.  <br>00:10:27.160 I think that's what it's called.Yeah. Just Google that jump in there.  <br>00:10:29.540 And we'll search for chasm at the topleft. There we go. I love the tagline.  <br>00:10:33.160 Open an isolation. In fact, Camerontold me about that. It's pretty cool.  <br>00:10:35.670 Anyways, we're gonnaclick on, add to Chrome,  <br>00:10:37.520 click on ad extension and it'sadded, but not quite done yet.  <br>00:10:41.430 We have a few more thingswe have to configure here.  <br>00:10:43.070 We're gonna go up toour puzzle piece here,  <br>00:10:44.190 which stands for extensions in Chrome.  <br>00:10:45.640 We're gonna scroll down until we seechasm, which is weirdly great out.  <br>00:10:48.550 It makes me feel weird, but it's fine.  <br>00:10:49.750 We're gonna click on the threedots and click on options.  <br>00:10:54.080 We're gonna change just really onething here. We're gonna add the URL for,  <br>00:10:57.080 for our chasm server that we just setup or the one that you just set up.  <br>00:11:00.400 So a past mine in here just likethat. And you can even choose, like,  <br>00:11:03.820 if you wanted to open a new windowor a new tab, I like new tab.  <br>00:11:06.300 It feels more like it'spart of my browser.  <br>00:11:07.530 Like I'm not doing anything outsidemy system, even though I totally am.  <br>00:11:10.260 So anyways, enough of that clickon save and that part's done.  <br>00:11:12.540 Just one more thing we have to do.  <br>00:11:13.870 We're gonna get back to our chasmworkspace here, our chasm dashboard.  <br>00:11:16.880 And from here, we're gonnago to the top, right?  <br>00:11:18.700 Click a little icon thereand then click on profile.  <br>00:11:21.070 Cuz this will be a settingthat is set per user. And yeah,  <br>00:11:23.910 you probably guess you canhave multiple users with this.  <br>00:11:26.270 You can have your friends, yourfamily, your kids use this,  <br>00:11:28.850 have different profiles. We'lltalk about that. Anyways.  <br>00:11:31.790 One thing we're gonna change right here.We have the default workspace image.  <br>00:11:34.920 This is what we'll launch. Wheneveryou do that, right. Click thing.  <br>00:11:37.290 We showed you earlier, clickon the dropdown and then choose your image.  <br>00:11:40.980 I'm gonna choose. Let's do brave. I likebrave. That's it. It's already saved.  <br>00:11:44.680 I don't have to do anythingelse. And now we can test it.  <br>00:11:46.480 It's gonna go back to that Redditpage and I'll pick a random link here.  <br>00:11:49.160 This guy right here, right click.And here we are open link and chasm.  <br>00:11:53.160 And just like that,  <br>00:11:54.080 a Docker container is being spun upbehind the scenes and it's streaming to my  <br>00:11:58.400 browser. I'm not opening this URL onmy computer. It's not tracking me.  <br>00:12:01.760 It doesn't know my IP [address.It](http://address.it/)'s not looking at my cookies,  <br>00:12:04.080 looking at my history. I'm completelyanonymous. As far as tracking me goes.  <br>00:12:08.780 And the cool thing is whatever I dohere in this browser, it doesn't matter.  <br>00:12:11.880 I can do whatever I stinking. What?Because guess what? I can just delete it.  <br>00:12:15.030 Like watch this click on theselittle dots here, delete session.  <br>00:12:18.310 I can trash the sucker, bad website,malware, whatever don't care. I'm secure.  <br>00:12:23.270 So I deleted it. It's gone. I was neverthere. I never accessed that website.  <br>00:12:26.810 No proof. And I think, youknow, think about that.  <br>00:12:28.550 That's probably the future of howwe deal with weird stuff like this,  <br>00:12:31.730 how we browse the internetright now, your computer,  <br>00:12:34.160 it designed to track a lotof what you do, cookies, um,  <br>00:12:37.450 your IP address your history. Andif your computer could track it,  <br>00:12:39.980 that means all these other websites,your accessing can track it as well.  <br>00:12:42.440 Not to mention these scare ofviruses in malware, which yeah,  <br>00:12:45.300 and we've got tools that can prevent that.  <br>00:12:46.460 We got tools that canscan what we download, uh,  <br>00:12:48.980 prevent what we access on the internet.But you know what? They're not perfect.  <br>00:12:51.960 The ideal use cases that we open upeverything in an isolated sandbox.  <br>00:12:55.350 And if we do do something bad, it doesn'tmatter. That instance, that browser,  <br>00:12:59.280 that VM is transient. Ephemeralbig words. It just disappears.  <br>00:13:03.590 Cuz it doesn't matter. Now secondtweak. I wanna show you real quick.  <br>00:13:05.850 Check this out. It's actuallykind of two tweaks in one first.  <br>00:13:08.390 If you scroll through your appshere in your, your workspaces,  <br>00:13:10.650 you'll notice that you don'tsee Cali Linux, which we,  <br>00:13:13.070 we talked about that a lot, but it'snot here. Did we lie to you? No, no.  <br>00:13:16.380 You can add more images and someare already default installed.  <br>00:13:19.340 So if I go back to admin, my adminportal over here on the left,  <br>00:13:22.520 I can click on images where I can managethe Docker images or containers that I  <br>00:13:26.600 can launch. Go and click on that.  <br>00:13:27.940 And here we already have 26 imagesready to go, but not all are enabled.  <br>00:13:31.960 So I'll start clicking onthe arrows down here. Here.  <br>00:13:33.880 We have doom for some reason.  <br>00:13:34.890 So if you wanna play doom in yourbrowser from a Docker container street,  <br>00:13:37.510 actually that sounds prettycool. Anyways, let's continue.  <br>00:13:40.270 I wanna go find call there. Itis call Lennox to enable this.  <br>00:13:43.830 I wanna click that box for the can.  <br>00:13:45.080 We're gonna click on the little dotshere on the right click on edit.  <br>00:13:48.490 And then right here towards themiddle, we have the enabled check box.  <br>00:13:51.440 Check that now while we'rehere at the same time,  <br>00:13:53.450 I'm gonna go ahead anddo the second tweak.  <br>00:13:55.560 Now when we launch Kelly Linuxwithout changing this second thing,  <br>00:13:59.290 it's gonna log us in as aregular user without root access.  <br>00:14:03.360 But of course we want root access. Wewant ultimate godlike control, right?  <br>00:14:06.440 One thing we have to changehere to make that happen.  <br>00:14:08.680 If you scroll down just a little bithere, we have the Docker run config,  <br>00:14:12.310 which by the way, you cando a ton of stuff with like,  <br>00:14:14.580 this is like a regular container.And if you know Docker containers,  <br>00:14:17.590 you can do everything here prettymuch. But one thing we care about,  <br>00:14:20.530 we're gonna do some JSON real quick.Don't worry. It's not scary. Uh,  <br>00:14:23.450 just follow along with me first. We'regonna type in user between double quotes.  <br>00:14:26.610 I'll do double quotethe user double quote,  <br>00:14:29.480 then I'll do a colon and then I'll doanother double quote and say root and then  <br>00:14:34.050 double quote. So just like this, thatis be beautiful. JSON right there.  <br>00:14:37.220 That's all we need. Just go down tothe bottom. Click on, submit done.  <br>00:14:40.940 Now it's not quite readyyet. If we go to our, uh,  <br>00:14:43.760 workspaces here at the top left,you'll see it here. Where to go.  <br>00:14:46.940 Oh right there. But it's got like alittle warning message right now. Your uh,  <br>00:14:51.210 chasm server is downloading the Dockercontainer for Cali getting all that  <br>00:14:54.680 stuff. Ready? No give, give ita minute. Just coffee break.  <br>00:14:57.820 You tip my coffee [again.So](http://again.so/) now Cali is ready.  <br>00:14:59.820 I'm gonna go and launch the sucker realquick launch, which this is so cool.  <br>00:15:03.040 Right? And now that we have root enabled,all we have to do is when it launches,  <br>00:15:06.240 when we're in our terminal, like weshould be like you are right now.  <br>00:15:08.800 We'll do SU or switch userspit to become root. Okay.  <br>00:15:12.590 Now for the third tweak and it's thelast one I'm gonna show you cuz we don't  <br>00:15:15.030 have enough time andthis one's pretty cool.  <br>00:15:16.510 It involves users and web filtering sofar we've been using the admin profile,  <br>00:15:20.510 but of course you can add other users.  <br>00:15:22.210 So what I'm gonna do is add my daughtersas users, my two oldest anyway,  <br>00:15:25.470 Chloe and Addie.  <br>00:15:26.150 And what I'll demonstrate is how I canmake sure that they're gonna be browsing  <br>00:15:28.730 safely and securely and then law.They can access with web filtering,  <br>00:15:32.990 which is just built in,  <br>00:15:34.180 I can whitelist and blacklist withwhat I want them to access. So anyways,  <br>00:15:37.220 let's check it out real quick,super easy. So just like before,  <br>00:15:39.500 I'll go to my admin portalhere and over here on the left,  <br>00:15:41.940 I'll click on users right now.I've got the default users.  <br>00:15:44.140 I'll go ahead and click on adduser to add a new one, Chloe,  <br>00:15:47.560 and then I'll set a password forher. And now just keep in mind.  <br>00:15:49.880 I'm manually setting apassword for or Chloe,  <br>00:15:51.950 but you can integrate this with an L Dand SAML or single signon situation at  <br>00:15:55.930 your business. If you have one or ifyou have a home lab with that stuff,  <br>00:15:59.070 you can do it too, cuz I totallydo. And I will end up doing that.  <br>00:16:01.510 But username and password is pretty muchall we need for now. I'll click OnIt.  <br>00:16:05.080 I'll add my second user for add submit.  <br>00:16:07.710 So now all I have to do is give themmy IP address or the URL of my chasm  <br>00:16:10.970 instance and they can get accessto this with our credentials. Now,  <br>00:16:13.440 moving beyond that, Ican assign web filtering,  <br>00:16:15.550 very simple to set this up almoststupid, easy, uh, over here on the left,  <br>00:16:19.170 we'll see an option four webfilter. Go ahead and select that.  <br>00:16:22.340 And here we got nothing.Let's create something.  <br>00:16:24.300 Go ahead and click on ad policy. Nowwe don't have a ton of options here.  <br>00:16:27.920 I name this test, but some cool things,  <br>00:16:29.560 especially for kids or peoplethat you want to restrict too.  <br>00:16:32.890 We can say deny by default. So likewhatever website it is, don't go to it.  <br>00:16:36.270 Unless I explicitly say they're allowedto go to, which is perfect for my kids.  <br>00:16:39.310 They're curious.  <br>00:16:40.090 So I can say deny by default and theonly site that can access is network  <br>00:16:43.800 [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/) also network chuck.coffee.You just put that all on the black list.  <br>00:16:48.510 Thanks Cameron. He justsays on the black list,  <br>00:16:50.200 we're gonna put that in the whitelist. and just scroll down.  <br>00:16:53.340 We got a few more options or reallyjust one more enable safe search,  <br>00:16:56.300 which is a Google option to makesure they don't search for bad stuff.  <br>00:16:59.520 And then we could enable categorization.  <br>00:17:01.200 But that is a featurethat must be licensed,  <br>00:17:03.300 which you're probably thinkingChuck, you said it was free. It is,  <br>00:17:06.319 but not everything's free.This is a community edition,  <br>00:17:08.260 which is more than enough. Likeyou're gonna have a hard time,  <br>00:17:10.859 like not finding all the features youwant. We get a snapshot, the differences.  <br>00:17:14.150 And one thing I wanna pointout, and this is just crazy.  <br>00:17:16.050 Community edition is $0 and includes allfeatures of enterprise right.  <br>00:17:20.730 Then one of the main limits is thatyou are limited to five simultaneous  <br>00:17:23.690 sessions and excludes somebranding and web categorization,  <br>00:17:26.650 which is what I just hit. Actually,  <br>00:17:28.550 we can't take advantage of some crazyURL filtering your web categorization,  <br>00:17:32.110 but we get some pretty coolstuff anyway. And of course,  <br>00:17:34.080 if you wanna goprofessional or enterprise,  <br>00:17:35.900 and if you're a businessschool or government entity,this is perfect for you.  <br>00:17:38.820 But anyways, let's continueanyways. That's all we care about.  <br>00:17:40.760 I'm gonna click on submit. Andthen one more thing we have to do.  <br>00:17:42.920 We have to apply this policyto our users to do that.  <br>00:17:45.240 We'll go over here tothe left, to our images.  <br>00:17:47.390 This will be applied per imageand I'll find, for example, brave,  <br>00:17:50.330 let's go and click on brave clickon the icons here, click on edit.  <br>00:17:53.340 And if I scroll down justa bit and when I say a bit,  <br>00:17:55.560 I mean a lot wehave the web filter policy.  <br>00:17:57.830 I'll change this from inheritto my, there it is right there.  <br>00:18:00.800 My test one and click on [submit.So](http://submit.so/) now let's give it a test.  <br>00:18:03.920 I wanna go ahead and launch brave.  <br>00:18:05.020 It should apply to me as well andright off the bat access tonight.  <br>00:18:08.570 So I try to go to Googleor Facebook, nothing,  <br>00:18:12.010 but I try to go to network chuck.com.What if I try to go to network [chuck.com](http://chuck.com/).  <br>00:18:15.930 Hey, real quick, Cameronand Chuck from the future,  <br>00:18:18.170 we figured out that it doesn'twant the HTTPS in there at all.  <br>00:18:20.850 So go ahead and take that out and justhave the domain name in there soon.  <br>00:18:24.270 Now let's go back to our workspaces.Find our brave web browser,  <br>00:18:27.450 go and launch the sucker. It shouldwork for me. You should block me.  <br>00:18:30.140 I am all users and by default it shouldblock the first website it comes with.  <br>00:18:33.260 Yeah, access denied. But now if we goto network, chuck.coffee, for example,  <br>00:18:38.980 naked by coffee. No [problem.My](http://problem.my/) daughters can too. Now it was cool.  <br>00:18:42.540 And check this out. If I go back to mydashboard and I go to my admin portal,  <br>00:18:45.320 if I scroll it like notice real quick,  <br>00:18:47.240 we have insight into everything goingon with thought our chasm instance here,  <br>00:18:51.010 or our chasm server, all theimage usage, all the errors.  <br>00:18:53.990 And then down here atthe bottom domain usage,  <br>00:18:56.190 we can track what our people are going to.  <br>00:18:58.510 So think about thatfrom a user perspective,  <br>00:18:59.830 as you're trying to protect your company'susers, uh, or your kids or whatever,  <br>00:19:04.030 you get a crazy amount of insight andcontrol. Okay, I gotta stop there.  <br>00:19:08.050 there are a ton more featuresI could talk of about like casting,  <br>00:19:11.240 which you can share your session withother people and they can watch you do  <br>00:19:13.640 stuff, uh, staging, which is crazy. Makesthings go faster, just so much more.  <br>00:19:17.800 I can't go into it. And by the way,if you do want to go into that,  <br>00:19:20.400 if you wanna learn how to do this,we'll have a little minicourse below.  <br>00:19:23.200 Check it out.  <br>00:19:23.860 But now I wanna change gears for asecond because I've shown you some cool  <br>00:19:26.400 stuff.  <br>00:19:26.640 I've shown you two use cases like securebrowsing and having a really awesome  <br>00:19:30.200 line X distro, just bamexploded onto your browser.  <br>00:19:33.770 But how do companies use this? Howcould you use it as a, a daily grind?  <br>00:19:37.610 How can you apply it to what you do now?  <br>00:19:39.840 There are some pretty cool use casesabove and beyond what we've already showed  <br>00:19:43.590 you. So now I'm gonna kickit off to Cameron. Cameron,  <br>00:19:45.580 show the people some cool stuff I'mgonna see Beardie right.  <br>00:19:48.990 So now that we're done going over justpersonal use case for like browser  <br>00:19:51.970 isolation, or maybe standing upyour own call Linux or Rubi desktop,  <br>00:19:55.270 there are some more use cases forthis that are a little less personal,  <br>00:19:58.170 more like business or enterprise suchas replacing your VDI solution. Uh,  <br>00:20:03.060 maybe your company right now usesCitrix. Citrix can be really cumbersome,  <br>00:20:06.730 hard to set up licensing. It'shard. What's great about it.  <br>00:20:09.980 That it's web native.  <br>00:20:10.500 You don't have to have anything asstalled on your endpoints in order to use  <br>00:20:12.940 chasm, you can have it justrun through any web browser,  <br>00:20:15.480 because if you ever use Citrixor any of the other stuff,  <br>00:20:17.530 you have to install crapon people's computers.  <br>00:20:19.130 It sucks and worry aboutversioning on the desktops, blah,  <br>00:20:23.530 none of that and chasms images areall secure outta the box because they  <br>00:20:27.530 constantly update theirrolling images every night,  <br>00:20:29.530 because the old way to do stuff is stupid.  <br>00:20:32.700 You would have a golden image thatadmins would like go into log into and  <br>00:20:36.240 update, like apply updatesand apply the patches of crap.  <br>00:20:39.230 This is like it's auto magic, automagic, and last but not least,  <br>00:20:43.760 it could be used for DevOps pipelines.  <br>00:20:45.440 So whether you want to testyour own custom doc Docker, ah,  <br>00:20:48.270 docking Docker containers or your code,  <br>00:20:51.020 you can use their secure APIs that areprovided with chasm to test that. Thanks,  <br>00:20:54.560 Cameron. All right. So chasm seriously.  <br>00:20:57.420 I'm gonna probably usethis every single day.  <br>00:20:59.700 I'm legit gonna have mykids use it. Cameron,  <br>00:21:01.200 you're gonna use this thing always,always forever. And I I'm being serious.  <br>00:21:04.520 I do just constantly spinup news stuff, new VMs.  <br>00:21:07.930 And this is a way easier way to do this.  <br>00:21:09.670 If I just wanna test something realquick or if I wanna browse to kind of a  <br>00:21:12.990 weird URL and not worryabout getting hacked,  <br>00:21:15.850 not to mention all the crazy usecases that Cameron mentioned,  <br>00:21:18.900 it's a pretty cool thing.  <br>00:21:19.710 So thanks again to chasm workspaces forsponsoring this video and making such a  <br>00:21:23.390 freaking cool product and like, yeah,I know they did sponsor this video,  <br>00:21:26.650 but I only say yes to things I reallylike and enjoy and will actually use  <br>00:21:30.820 myself, especially when it's free andaccessible to pretty much everybody.  <br>00:21:34.160 So I dunno what you're waiting for.If you haven't already tried it,  <br>00:21:36.060 if you didn't followalong this video, do it.  <br>00:21:38.800 And it's right now right now is whenyou gotta do it. And if you did it,  <br>00:21:42.460 let me know what you thoughtcomment below and uh, by the way,  <br>00:21:45.770 have you hacked YouTube algorithmstoday? Let's make sure you do that.  <br>00:21:49.250 Like button notification, bellsubscribe, and already said comment.  <br>00:21:52.270 So just do that. You gotta hack YouTubetoday. Ethically of course. And yeah,  <br>00:21:56.650 that's all I got. Thanks again to mybrother, Cameron, for helping out today.  <br>00:22:00.470 Let me know again, if you wanna seemore of him, if you don't, I don't care,  <br>00:22:03.130 I'll still include him. Oh. Andalmost forgot by the way. Um,  <br>00:22:06.210 we are gonna include more tutorials,more of a deep dive on chasm,  <br>00:22:09.680 how to do all the kind of crazy cool stuffthat we didn't include in this video.  <br>00:22:13.250 Check it out.

There's a lot of people I see asleep on this They're They're asleep on this Chuck They're not paying attention Do you think the roles we have now with like IT engineers network engineers will exist in 5 years um I have a question that's kind of been keeping me up at night Is there a future for network engineers in the age of AI like in 5 years are we going to exist that's why I'm here at Cisco Live the largest networking conference in the entire world And I'm asking this question I need the answer I'm asking Cisco people I'm asking network engineers who come here 22,000 of them hey what do you think about AI are you worried do you currently use AI is this a thing for you and let me tell you this year feels different for network engineers Everywhere you step everywhere you look AI AI AI The opening keynote Chuck Robbins AI G2 Patel AI Everything is AI So here we go Let's dive in Okay First walking up to Cisco Live the conference center AI everywhere Every sign every advertisement it's the AI era We're powering AI Every booth in the world of solutions had something to say about AI We kind of have a reason to be a little bit worried about AI In fact I just saw a Reddit post today where someone who had just gone to Cisco Live they're like "Huh are we going to be okay?" It's a very question I'm trying to answer dayto-day And by the way this video is sponsored by Cisco They brought me out to Cisco Live and they gave me the freedom to make whatever I wanted Thank you Cisco team You are amazing Now my first mission was to figure out how people feel about AI Are they optimistic are they scared um I can tell you that I touch AI almost daily for almost everything I do for work So AI how do you feel about it are you optimistic are you excited are you all in you get all in or you get all out How do you feel about AI oh I love AI I use it almost every day So really okay So you're optimistic about it oh yeah I think it's the future I mean everything's going to have AI in it going forward And if you don't learn it now you're going to get left behind So I'm optimistic Great I know AI has been around but in a different form than what we're used to right now right so AI now I think it'll actually enhance all of our experiences Right I'm optimistic about it I've used it for both college and personal like creating experience So you use AI now yep Um I know my colleague here is not so keen on it really I'm indifferent I mean I think it's neat for security and like medical stuff but right all the GPT and all that stuff It's neat but I don't care Now overall people seem to be pretty excited about AI They're optimistic They think that AI is going to make their lives better because it already has And I know for me it has in some ways and the more models that come out and the the better I understand how to use it it does actually help me with some things but not everything We'll get to that later Then I wanted to see okay network engineers IT people how are they actually using AI are they using it with their jobs and not just with their everyday life stuff with AI are you using it right now in your job i am How are you using it mostly for uh code ciloting and stuff that I don't want to do We actually just started about a year ago and we're actually going heavy into AI We're a utility company right so we're finding ways whereby AI could help us automate a lot of stuff that's you know done manually right now So I mean we talk we talk about about this all the time Um AI is an assistant to what you do And so you are the gatekeeper of what you allow AI to do or not do to your infrastructure Um we I think it's encouraged today to leverage that assistant next to you I know you and I when we talked first talked about automation back what five six years ago uh we were starting the whole DevNet thing and we talked about okay so is automation going to change the way I manage my network and is it going to take my job and and and and here we are we're just talking about automation as a skill as something that you should adopt as part of your tool set when you're working with your network AI is the same um my company we're we're trying to use AI where we can um I You don't want to rely completely on AI but it's a great starting point I mean I'll give you for instance I had to write a document uh really an ITIL document on that So okay I go to co-pilot C-pilot write me a document based based on ITIL you know give me a policy document So it gives me a policy document Okay make these changes making these changes gets me like 60% of the way there in minutes At that point now I can take it and do my own thing I wouldn't take that document and put it forward and said "Here's my document." Right Right Don't do that but it's 60s something percent of the way there and now it's a really easy way to say okay where do I go from there rather than sitting at a blank page and going what do I AI is just another tool um and I've been talking this week a lot about ways that network engineers can use AI today to make themselves better engineers so an example I I I will sometimes go into is you're you know you've got some piece of knowledge buried deep in the back of your head but it's buried under dust and cobwebs and too many late nights with pizza um you could go try to dive through it or go into it But I like asking AI cuz I know if I see the right answer I was like "Yeah that's the right answer I can dive in." So verification of information great use case for it Now speaking of using AI one of my first interviews I actually had was sitting down with John Capo Biano This guy is a ball of energy I love him Thank you for sitting down with me John He's a former Cisco employee but now he has left and he's working for an AI company called Selector AI I wanted to sit down with John because he's kind of at the forefront of networking with AI on Twitter He's the first guy I see messing with MCP agent to agent agent ops all those buzzwords And I asked him the same question Are you optimistic about AI why do you think it was that you were more excited versus like we're doomed well I see it as um like the computer is for human convenience Now I'm old I'm very old My first computer didn't come with a mouse Oh The mouse was a peripheral that was screwed into the back on a serial port And now I could move the mouse around Okay I know it sounds hilariously trivial and I'm really old but it's about convenience is it not mhm So now instead of menus and gooies and clicking and memorizing commands and I can use my own natural intuition and just sus out questions in a conversational way Now should we be frightened uh I think we should be a little frightened right there's with the great power comes the great responsibility but it's an opportunity Chuck I see this like like the protocols we just talked about MCP and ADA Why they've got me so excited is because they're protocols like HTTP or SMTP or spanning tree protocols Your code can work with my code because we're developing them with standards It's not the wild west anymore Right And it's very much like the late 90s mid 90s where protocols suddenly changed the world Right Right Think about HTTP hypertext transfer protocol and HTML What did that do for the world right it brought us online Yeah it did Yeah So now these new MCP tools are going to bring us even further with artificial intelligence So you're overall optimistic i'm optimistic I'm optimistic So of course obviously John works for an AI company He's pretty optimistic But I loved one of the last conversations I had with Hank Preston Now hint Preston if you don't know who he is he when I first met him he was the Python network automation guy back in 2018209 a big shift in networking was happening we as network engineers and admins were being told that we have to become developers in fact Susie we got to the stage and said hey you guys are developers now and that kind of scared a lot of network engineers including myself like are we going away is our job going away guess what it But Hank was at the forefront of that He had an amazing session that everyone flocked to He was like the guy those years and he was showing us how to start using network automation and Python with network automation This is a key thing I want you to remember We're going to touch on that later But one of the last things that Hank said to me and Jeremy as we were talking to him was that he said "You have to be optimistic about AI What else are you going to do?" And that's I kind of feel like where everyone is We're choosing to be optimistic you have to to wake up in the morning and continue on with this network engineering journey Now do we have a reason to be optimistic that's still what I'm trying to figure out The next thing I wanted to know is are these people worried so they may be optimistic about AI but are they worried about network engineering are they worried about their own jobs no I think the role is changing Back then networks were not what they I mean licensing what isn't what it is today So so you look at how networks has progressed since then It's the same thing I I think a network engineer that's saying like well I just you know I I build switches I plug that's not an engineer it's a jockey um that whole that whole job has changed over the years Yeah So now you think about like you know you look at catalyst center you can deploy switches very quickly So using uh using the tools in catalyst center to deploy how many switches right away Yeah that's true So so the job itself has changed and I think everyone understands that and they need to you know learn the new stuff and and move forward with that So one thing about AI is yes there might be job loss but also creates opportunity for you to learn new stuff and you know remain relevant So I'm not worried about that at all I actually embrace it I think it's going to be overall net good for everybody Yeah you know do you what's your take on AI as far as the job market goes do you think it's kind of scary like we're going to start losing jobs or what do you think i would say like 25% jobs of the current form will go away New jobs have come but it will not like gap all the beaches bridges but it will come different things So like as a current technology like here the tech expert I would say like people try to get familiar with it like the way we get oursel familiar with apps smartphones we should get familiar with it and get on top of it and take it like another cuisine right you are just trying out another cuisine just don't be afraid of it right so I don't think that networking as a career is going to diminish I think it's going to become more and more specialized more and more specialized to support you know high performance computing or GPUs or large language models in the data center Um I think we still have 3 to 5 years of a safety net I don't think that it's going to be that revolutionary and that fast Beyond 3 to 5 years it's really hard to project or predict I think the time for skepticism is behind us I think that everyone who is using AI has an advantage over people who are not using AI Okay Right And as we have this conversation if you're not using AI there are people are there are other people using it right and there's going to be a parody gap here And that is what I'm worried about are the people here that aren't using it that aren't paying attention that are going to wake up one day to a whole new reality that they're not prepared for Um at least today and and it some of this certainly will change as AI models get better Um but right now AI is not truly creative AI are mathematical models that are building on patterns and finding patterns that are there and giving you good information and it's fantastic at that And so one of the things that I think true humans are still necessary is for innovative ideas Um I'm also I try to be optimistic right the world is not for machines The world is for people and I think that we will recognize that there is still value in having people involved in the work not just the machines that are there Again optimism They think network engineering is going to be okay Many saying that network engineering will become even more critical as AI becomes more prevalent More data centers means more network engineers making those data centers work I like that viewpoint So I don't know about you but at this point I'm feeling pretty good I've talked to people at Cisco I've talked to engineers I've talked to engineers who love using AI and they're all feeling pretty good about it for now And that was my next question because right now AI is moving at a pace I can't keep up with Can you keep up with it it seems like every single week in fact just this week and I haven't looked at it yet or even played with it we had a new model 03 Pro come out So my question was in 5 years is the job of network engineer going to exist or system engineer IT engineer because in 5 years a lot can change I think they're going to change They've been changing Uh I think you're still going to have network engineers uh obviously still have managers like myself but uh you know the roles are going to be there but they're going to change because we have to change with the times you know uh you look at uh you look at cyber security you look at uh all the problems that are out there the bad guys are also using AI so they're getting quicker so we have to worry about that as well it it it's going to be different for sure yeah what's like uniquely human that you can do just that kind of thinking what's uniquely engineer right so you know you can't build a network unless you actually understand how networks network right right I mean we all know we've all seen networks where you're looking at that and like you're like who built that do do you understand it was AI AI built it Yeah You know so you know there will always be the need to be able to have a deeper understanding of how the network works Do you think the role of network engineer as we know it right now will that exist in 5 years it will We should be running the bots Oh definitely especially network engineers you know AI runs on the network so you're going to have to have the network there So I just see it making us uh more efficient you know if anything we're but we're never going to go away We're here to stay It's more of AI actually assisting actually seeing more visibility of the network and what's going on and give us more instead of working you know 12 16 18 hour days it actually allow us to work eight hour days Do you guys think that there will be a future for networking do you think the AI will take over networking uh I don't think so As it like I said as it currently stands now Definitely not In the future it's possible I think it's it's somewhere in the middle I think the the mundane tasks that we uh do daytoday are going to go away which means I don't need to SSH into a box I don't need to look at what's going on with my network that way I'm going to probably have an agent that do that for me But we talked about this like automation whether before AI you were supposed to do that anyway right with automation um do I think it's going to we're still going to touch the CLI I think at some level we will um it's going to probably be augmented with AI built into the terminal which I think it's out there today where you have your CLI you have an agent on your terminal that's helping you with commands I don't I don't know most of the iOS XC commands and I can't tell you how many times I go out to Cisco Docs or I go out to Google to search for it Now it's there So it's going to speed up It's going to it's going to make make me have superpowers um as a network engineer but I don't think it's going to make me obsolete I think that network engineer looks similar to the one that is today but they've in uh incorporated uh more security skills because again there's not a company I know of that wants an insecure network And and I I would also say someone that understands it not just from a network security standpoint but a cyber security standpoint understands red teaming understands pen testing understands blue teaming skills like incident response and threat hunting I also think that that's someone that natively understands automation I I I think that you know everybody thinks about AI almost like it's an easy button It's not If you really want to get the benefits of AI if you really want to feel them in your network you have to you have to automate more of your network uh operations and activities and that's going to be a big part of I think any uh CCNA CCNP CCIE engineer and what they're doing They're going to be thinking about how they can really drive that automation to get the benefits of AI Otherwise when I hear of people talk about oh it's all hype It's all hype until you really automate that network activity and I think that that's going to be a big part of the future work that our engineers are going to be doing Now this question I feel like had the most fun answers It became more practical for me For example Clark he said "We'll have 8 hour days instead of these 16-hour days that network engineers are normally faced with Waking up and and getting those calls Maybe AI removes being on call Wouldn't that be amazing?" Karine said that AI is going to give us superpowers It will augment us and make us better It'll do the things that we don't want to do And Josh reiterated that AI runs on the network The network powers it The more AI there is the more AI needs us Now my take on that I think it's optimistic and we have to be optimistic It's really hard to say what's going to happen in 5 years If we're honest with ourselves we will all say that we were all surprised where AI is at this present moment No one saw this coming I feel like we're going to be saying something very similar in five years And then I asked one more fun question It was a meme I saw on X or Twitter I don't know what to call it What do you call it still which side of the bus are you on and this assumes the premise that AI will eventually take half of all jobs Will you be on the left side where you're saddened by the idea of AI taking jobs you don't want it to happen You think people should be the ones working Or are you on the right side of the bus will you be overjoyed by the idea that AI takes jobs maybe we enter a postj job world Sure there's problems to solve Oh a lot more problems to solve with that scenario Where do you sit uh I'm the girl standing in the middle going it could do that and it could do that My jury's still out if you'll pardon the pun I'm somewhere in the middle Somewhere in the middle Okay Lots of jobs be happy to hand off to AI I'm on the AI's going to take all our jobs right okay And I'm and I am an outlier right like I I have my own unique uh take on this but it is it to me it being AI and large language models and natural language and chatting with the computer It it is like the promise of the last 30 40 years I feel like we've been on this trajectory and we're sort of reaching the operand of Mo's law and some of these right we're really starting to maximize our compute power and I I again I believe in a utopian outcome now whether or not we it's going to cost a lot of jobs I think that as yes some jobs will be displaced but you know two years ago there wasn't such a thing as a machine learning engineer right so new emerging categories of jobs will will come out Uh I would say for me somewhere in the middle um maybe towards the the left a little bit where is it is AI going to destroy half of all the jobs i don't think so And I I I want to say this and this is something that we we we overlook often which is humans engineers um network engineers have this thing that AI doesn't have which is critical thinking and so you built your critical thinking uh skills from learning from uh troubleshooting networks from experience right that AI does does not have the capability to do that critical thinking skills Now I think I'm somewhere in the middle as well There are jobs in history that don't exist anymore and should not exist Like lamplighters That was a popular example that the CEO of Anthropic used when he was talking about "Hey wake up Jobs might be taken In 2 to 3 years we might see 50% of jobs gone." But also I think that we need to work People need to work People need purpose We should never remove people from these jobs AI should always be there to help us but never replace us And that's a common theme I heard many many times throughout talking with everyone in all these interviews is that AI isn't going to replace you but someone using AI will But then John Capo Biano and he comes in with the craziest notion and many people do hold this view He was fully on the right side of the bus And then the keynote happened The opening keynote at Cisco Live is where they announced all the crazy stuff they're doing And shocker they talked about AI a lot Chuck Robbins opened with saying that the AI race is on We have to move forward We have to be quick because everyone is trying to have the best AI We have to make it secure We have to make it the best We all know that every company every organization every government around the world There's also a defensive mechanism There's a FOMO element about what are you doing in AI and I agree There's no stopping it The only thing we can do now is sprint forward as fast as we can I get that And then G2 Patel took the stage One thing he said stood out to me With the help of agents or AI we can take the 8 billion people in the world and augment them in a way to where we have a throughput a workforce throughput of 80 billion people So 8 billion humans will feel like we have the throughput capacity of 80 billion humans He then went on to say that we're going to have a different looking workforce We'll have humans of course maybe but we'll also have AI agents AI apps robotics and humanoids That's terrifying but it's going to happen And then they announced something pretty cool and also pretty terrifying They announced their own purpose-built AI model for networking It's called the deep network model It's been trained on a ton of networking related data and tasks And similar to how they benchmark other AI LLMs on coding task this one they gave it a CCIE test labs and exam and it performed 20% better than the other leading LLM models They actually announced something similar at RSA conference but it was security focused I think it was called the security foundation model I did try it out It was okay But then Cisco showed us something pretty crazy They're putting AI in the data center and they're doing it with a thing called AI canvas It's a new control panel that's all about AI it's AI first and they gave a demo in which this guy was troubleshooting a connectivity error and this demo was live real time and he simply just chatted with this interface which I believe was the deep network model and it started doing things that man humans just can't do It's multimodal so it was generating graphs and charts about the network in real time Graphs and charts that we could drag on over to the main canvas real time dashboard creation which honestly is amazing But then they showed one more terrifying thing They had the model figure out a configuration like produce a QoS policy or a cost policy for me quality of service and then he asked it to apply this policy So at this point this is something a network engineer would have done We would have gotten into the routers the switches wherever this QoS policy would need to be applied We would have troubleshooted it figured out the configuration and applied it The AI did this for the guy operating this I forgot his name And all he had to do was just tell it his intent What do you wanted to happen in regular human language not CLI speak like we spend so long learning when we're studying for the CCNA and CCMP which brought me to a conversation I had with Kareem Escander and Joe Clark Kareem is part of the team that actually brought me out to Cisco Thank you Kareem How do you teach them to use AI and then make sure they're using it right how do you have a CCNA exam that's measuring if they're using AI effectively along with troubleshooting a network one of the ways we we think we can do this well first of all we might have to reconsider how we evaluate exams So in the real world you would have Google you would have chat GPT Instead of doing a lot of multiple choice memorization like you just said imagine if your exam allows you access to an LLM allows you access to a search and instead of multiple choice you're dropped onto a web portal for Moroi or you're dropped into a CLI and you actually when it says configure when it says implement you have to configure you have to implement The second part of your question is towards how do you get them to think critically about what AI is coming back with We think there's an opportunity to present them with um artifacts like this is the topology diagram of the network These are the configurations of the network This is the prompt and this is what the LLM said What do you think is the right answer what do you think is the most accurate response the AI has given you and if they've studied if they've prepared if they've played with some of that LLM with something like Cisco modeling labs in a simulated environment they should be able to answer that They should be able to say "Ah you can't do that interface there." Or it says "We're not allowed to run this protocol in our network so I can't trust that answer It has to be this answer." So what we're seeing right now is people say "You need to learn AI You still need to learn the CCNA but you need to learn all the new tools." A big focus that Joe mentioned was learning how to interpret the results of an AI So when you're talking with an LLM and being able to see if it's giving you bad data or it's hallucinating Okay so let's close this up I came to Cisco Live to figure out is there a future for network engineers this year We had an attendance of 22,000 people 22,000 people that care about networking that were there to learn about networking to kind of get a forecast for the future What are we supposed to be learning the overall take of many people I talked with was they're optimistic They're using AI every day in their job and they're actually excited about how it's going to make their lives easier their jobs easier Some are honest and saying "Yeah it might take away some jobs but it won't take away the jobs of people who adapt who learn and use AI in their current roles." Now I know in many roles I've had we've been understaffed We needed more people but we couldn't find them So I totally understand the appeal of having an AI buddy to augment your staff I just hope it doesn't go too far to where they realize suddenly they don't need me either But I will say this I was so encouraged being at this conference because what I saw was still a strong desire to learn networking People are still tons of people are still going for their CCNA their CCMP Everyone's excited about learning that next new thing and they're also excited about learning the basics IP addressing subnetting OPF EIGRP For the time being no matter how good AI gets we need people who know those protocols so we can tell AI when it's being dumb But reality check real change is coming and we need to be ready to adapt You need to adapt now If you haven't already started playing with AI you need to become very familiar with it I think the best thing you can do for yourself right now is just ask yourself how can AI help me do my current job better also get in community Talk with your fellow engineers and see what they're doing But also take comfort in this This is no different than anything we've ever encountered in it We've always had to learn and adapt to the new technologies that come up The people who don't adapt they do get left behind We had traditional telefan migrate to voiceover IP We saw the big change with network automation going from manually configuring a switch a switch a switch with CLI to configuring thousands all at once with automation One might say that AI is simply another iteration the next generation of automation And as far as what network engineers will be doing in the future I think that's probably it It will not be getting in the weeds as much as we are right now dealing with outages and and looking through logs It'll be how can I make the network better how can I automate more of the stuff we already have and in 5 years who knows you can't know Be optimistic Keep studying And from what we can see the world needs network engineers And we have a shortage and more AI is being built and we got to help power it Now I want to know what you think The questions I asked I would love to have those put in the comments below That's all I got I'll catch you guys next|### SUMMARY  <br>Presenter discusses the future of network engineering amidst
