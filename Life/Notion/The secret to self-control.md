  

==**Disciplined people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control, in other words, they spend less time in tempting situations**==

  

==**The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least.**==

  

==**It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often.**==

  

==**The way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment**==

  

==**A habit that has been encoded in the mind is ready to be used whenever the relevant situation arises**==

  

==**Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear**==

  

==**Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself**==

  

==**They foster the feelings they try to numb. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits**==

  

==**Cue-induced wanting: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit**==

  

==**Once you notice something, you begin to want it**==

  

==**You can break a bad habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it**==

  

==**In the short run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the long-run…**==

  

> ==**We become a product of the environment we live in**==

  

==**I’ve never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment**==

  

==**A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source**==

  

==**Reduce exposure to the cue that causes it**==

  

==**This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behaviour change. Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible**==

  

==**Remove a single cue and the entire habit often fades away**==

  

==**Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one**==

  

==**This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible**==
