## Transcript

**0:01**

this right here is the Linux utility you

**0:04**

may have noticed I haven't been making

**0:05**

very many videos over here but this is

**0:08**

something I thought was deemed worthy of

**0:10**

a video this is an actual script or a

**0:14**

compilation of scripts uh with a rust

**0:18**

wrapper around it now what does all that

**0:19**

mean it means you can essentially come

**0:22**

into here go with curl

**0:25**

fssl Chris titus. comom Linux and and

**0:30**

pipe it to sh you might start to see a

**0:32**

little bit of I wanted to kind of bring

**0:35**

what I did with the windows utility into

**0:37**

the Linux realm and this will go to

**0:40**

GitHub download the binary and launch

**0:43**

into this now in wrapped in that

**0:45**

beautiful binary is all these cool stuff

**0:48**

now obviously everything's open source

**0:50**

over on GitHub as with everything uh

**0:54**

most of everything is written in rust on

**0:57**

the front end and then a lot of scripts

**0:59**

are in bash and some people are probably

**1:01**

already going in the comments why aren't

**1:03**

you just using whiptail or some fancy uh

**1:06**

already

**1:07**

built-in a tool in Linux like zenity or

**1:11**

those types of things and frankly I just

**1:13**

thought they looked ugly and I didn't

**1:15**

like how they worked so I was like yeah

**1:18**

how hard can it be to write one of these

**1:20**

programs and I'll just use a fancy

**1:23**

language I'll just go buy this book and

**1:27**

get everything I need to learn and just

**1:30**

write a rust program because that's what

**1:32**

all the cool kids today

**1:34**

use ah oh how naive I was but I digress

**1:40**

this right here is what we ended up with

**1:43**

and it's starting to take shape mostly

**1:46**

thanks to the open source realm I'll get

**1:49**

into the contributors and how all this

**1:50**

was built because trust me it wasn't

**1:53**

just me now all these are

**1:56**

my customization so the idea behind the

**2:00**

toolbox is to launch it and then simply

**2:02**

Say Hey I want to set up bash I'm just

**2:05**

going to remove my entire bash RC right

**2:08**

so when we close out we launch it your

**2:11**

your shell probably look something like

**2:13**

this rather ugly right so if we just

**2:16**

curl that command or you could just run

**2:19**

it we can install it directly on the

**2:20**

system I haven't built that quite in yet

**2:23**

but for now we'll just do this and let's

**2:26**

say we want to uh you know what grab my

**2:29**

Bash project install it and grab any

**2:33**

dependencies I might be missing all

**2:35**

right success great so then we quit out

**2:40**

relaunch there's all my customizations

**2:43**

back as it was so all these things in

**2:45**

Linux that were taking so much time I

**2:47**

used to make 10 15 minute videos like

**2:50**

three times a week telling people how to

**2:52**

do these things and you'd have to watch

**2:54**

the whole video and go step by step I

**2:56**

want to get it to a point where new

**2:58**

users to Linux because I think there

**3:00**

will be many especially with some of the

**3:03**

Microsoft Shenanigans with recall don't

**3:05**

worry Windows utility I'm working on

**3:08**

programming that out of Windows as well

**3:10**

and I haven't given up on Windows even

**3:12**

though I

**3:15**

should uh I still love the challenge

**3:18**

I've added a bunch of different things

**3:19**

to this uh and it depends on what system

**3:22**

you're on as well already I can see

**3:25**

people saying well I don't use Arch I'm

**3:27**

a Debian user or I'm an a fodora user or

**3:29**

I use some derivative of those three

**3:32**

typically uh don't worry if you're on

**3:36**

like Fedora let's just say hey Let's

**3:39**

Pretend We're on Fedora we're just going

**3:41**

to use drro box and enter

**3:43**

Fedora and then we launch into it again

**3:46**

then we come back you'll notice oh that

**3:49**

changed to Fedora well oh okay RPM

**3:54**

Fusion that's that's a good Fedora only

**3:57**

tweak the idea behind all this is all

**4:00**

those tweaks I was making when I was

**4:01**

drro hopping and using different

**4:03**

distributions over the years there's a

**4:05**

lot of things that are sometimes drro

**4:07**

specific sometimes not and I wanted to

**4:10**

include everything in this

**4:13**

toolbox which is kind of cool so let's

**4:16**

launch back in one more time and you'll

**4:19**

notice when we go back to Arch Linux oh

**4:22**

yeah so we set up a helpers and we even

**4:24**

have a little server setup here what

**4:26**

does that look like well this is

**4:29**

basically revitalizing Arch Titus but

**4:31**

doing it for someone that just wants a

**4:33**

really solid Arch base but they don't

**4:35**

want to follow the install instructions

**4:37**

they just want to set up arch in 2

**4:39**

minutes 120 seconds this will do it in

**4:43**

that time period so that's why I I'm

**4:47**

doing this utilities one just to save

**4:48**

users a lot of time give you a nice

**4:51**

playground let's say you just want to

**4:52**

mess around in VMS and your windows user

**4:54**

just trying out this whole Linux thing

**4:56**

the idea is to go through all these and

**4:59**

change and set all these up to where if

**5:01**

you want to just use a tiling window

**5:03**

manager and you don't want to use like a

**5:05**

big desktop environment like KDE and all

**5:07**

that other stuff I want to put

**5:10**

everything every script everything I can

**5:13**

think of everything I use on a daily

**5:16**

basis into here to where you're at your

**5:20**

main page and you're like hey I want to

**5:22**

change something with my monitor just

**5:24**

type in monitor or oh you know what I

**5:27**

I'm doing a game modification today want

**5:30**

Diablo I uh loot

**5:32**

filters there's the loot filter install

**5:35**

that I made for Diablo I resurrected and

**5:38**

and all these like tweaks for Linux is

**5:42**

is kind of what I've been working on

**5:43**

these last two months and uh also

**5:46**

coupled with 200 and something pull

**5:48**

requests over on the Windows utility it

**5:49**

just hasn't left much time for YouTube

**5:51**

videos but just know I'm still hard at

**5:54**

work here I haven't left YouTube or

**5:56**

anything like that I I just want to make

**5:58**

a really an amazing utility for everyone

**6:00**

that makes your life easier no matter

**6:03**

the operating system you choose and this

**6:07**

is the the beginnings of it now a big

**6:09**

shout out here just to kind of showcase

**6:11**

how this was done was a lot of this was

**6:14**

the contributors we've already had 34

**6:16**

contributors throughout here because I

**6:18**

live stream three times a week now over

**6:21**

on Twitch and and also YouTube on Titus

**6:23**

Tech talk I didn't want to inundate

**6:25**

people's streams here on the main

**6:26**

Channel and a lot of these contributors

**6:29**

big shout out to just Linux user was the

**6:32**

first iteration of the rust utility and

**6:35**

then we had various improvements from

**6:37**

like Alonso and then uh Liam uh or LJ

**6:41**

user he's done a lot of PLL requests too

**6:43**

because a lot of this stuff when it

**6:46**

comes to rust I can write like hello

**6:48**

world and some of the more simplistic

**6:50**

things but I have ideas that I can put

**6:52**

into practice but a lot of times it's

**6:55**

these contributors refining this down

**6:57**

into something truly amazing that can be

**7:01**

done at such a fast pace that we're able

**7:03**

to accomplish a lot of things in the

**7:06**

Linux realm so be looking forward to

**7:08**

this project try it out if you have any

**7:11**

issues with it you can always submit

**7:12**

issues or let's say you're a programmer

**7:15**

and you're fluent in bash or you you

**7:19**

have uh some Rust knowledge look at my

**7:22**

code I'm sure it could get better uh and

**7:25**

definitely submit PRS if it is indeed

**7:28**

one thing I do want to cost question

**7:29**

people about is make sure if you do

**7:32**

submit something that goes in the global

**7:34**

one and you can't make a hypers specific

**7:38**

uh bash script for something it has to

**7:40**

work on every drro that's the big thing

**7:43**

and that's one thing I'm working on I

**7:45**

have a common script library that I P

**7:47**

from so a lot of these scripts are very

**7:48**

small the entire binary at the end of

**7:51**

the day I just did a PR to to reduced

**7:53**

this binary size but the assets at the

**7:56**

end of day is about 1.5 Megs and and I

**8:01**

you know I don't want to sound like an

**8:02**

old man but I grew up in a generation

**8:05**

where a lot of things were packaged into

**8:08**

just ridiculously small sizes this

**8:10**

doesn't have to be a huge size and the

**8:13**

Linux utility is actually even smaller

**8:15**

since it's Powershell script that was

**8:16**

reduced from 800 kilobytes to 600

**8:19**

kilobytes having clean proper performing

**8:22**

code on all these things or something I

**8:24**

always kind of obsess over so I don't

**8:26**

want a a Call of Duty situation where

**8:28**

I'm like okay download my 100 Meg I'm

**8:31**

sorry if it was Call of Duty it would

**8:33**

have been 200 gigs of data waste from a

**8:37**

bunch of Junior

**8:39**

devs I want to get a clear concise thing

**8:42**

here have everybody enjoy it and I just

**8:44**

wanted to give you kind of a quick

**8:46**

update on this pre-release types of

**8:48**

things a and see what I'm working on on

**8:51**

the Linux realm I haven't forgotten

**8:53**

about Linux I still love it I'm

**8:55**

designing a lot of things to just Auto

**8:57**

set up make it one click of a button and

**8:59**

just just have it work and I look

**9:02**

forward to this future but also the

**9:04**

windows utility as well though that is

**9:06**

going very well we just did 200 and

**9:09**

something pull requests which is a

**9:11**

massive uh inclusion in the project and

**9:14**

uh was still working on some removal of

**9:17**

Microsoft Edge just recently changed yet

**9:19**

again so that one's not working but it

**9:21**

will and then obviously I've been

**9:24**

waiting for Microsoft to include recall

**9:27**

in I think 24h 2 to get coating on

**9:30**

ripping it out Ah that's going to be

**9:34**

maddening makes me want to have a drink

**9:36**

just thinking about it all right but

**9:38**

with that said I'll see you guys in the

**9:40**

next one uh I just want to update you on

**9:41**

this next utility uh update I will do

**9:44**

windows and you guys should get a good

**9:46**

update because we just did a massive

**9:48**

update on the Windows utility and I look

**9:50**

forward to showing that to you uh let me

**9:52**

know down in the comments what you would

**9:54**

like to see with the Linux utility where

**9:56**

are your pain points on Linux because I

**9:58**

aim to fix

**10:00**

all of those and I know some people are

**10:02**

already saying hey Titus what about um

**10:06**

TTY or let's say you don't have a

**10:09**

guey no worries we have themes this runs

**10:12**

in the console as well so if you are

**10:14**

server based don't worry about it we got

**10:17**

**10:21**
