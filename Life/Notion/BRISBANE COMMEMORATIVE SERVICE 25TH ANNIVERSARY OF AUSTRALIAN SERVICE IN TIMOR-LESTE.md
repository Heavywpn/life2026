## Summary of the INTERFET Mission to East Timor

The International Force East Timor (INTERFET) was a multinational peacekeeping taskforce, led by Australia, that was deployed to East Timor in 1999. Key points of the mission include:

- Deployment: Authorized by the UN Security Council on September 15, 1999, in response to escalating violence following East Timor's vote for independence from Indonesia.
- Leadership: Led by Australian Major General Peter Cosgrove, with 23 participating nations.
- Objectives: To restore peace and security in East Timor, protect and support the UN Mission, and facilitate humanitarian assistance operations.
- Duration: Operated from September 20, 1999, to February 23, 2000, when it handed over to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).
- Achievements: Successfully stabilized the region, allowing for the return of displaced East Timorese and the establishment of a transitional UN administration.
- Significance: Marked Australia's largest military deployment since the Vietnam War and played a crucial role in East Timor's transition to independence.

The INTERFET mission was a significant milestone in Australia's military history and its engagement with Southeast Asia, demonstrating the country's capacity to lead complex multinational operations in the region.
