# Leadership learning

Based on the content of this page, there are no direct leadership lessons explicitly stated. The page primarily contains biblical summaries and verses from the Old and New Testaments. However, we can extrapolate some general leadership principles from the biblical narratives:

- Faithfulness and Perseverance: Abraham's story demonstrates the importance of remaining faithful to one's commitments and persevering through challenges.
- Ethical Decision-Making: The complex situations faced by biblical figures like Abraham can prompt reflection on ethical leadership and decision-making in difficult circumstances.
- Compassion and Inclusivity: Jesus' actions in the New Testament, such as calling sinners to repentance, highlight the importance of compassionate and inclusive leadership.
- Authority and Responsibility: Jesus' demonstrations of authority over various domains (nature, evil spirits, sickness) can be seen as a model for responsible use of leadership power.
- Faith and Trust: The importance of faith is emphasized in both testaments, which can be applied to having confidence in one's vision and team as a leader.

To improve your leadership based on these principles, you might consider:

- Developing resilience and commitment to long-term goals
- Enhancing your ethical decision-making skills, especially in complex situations
- Cultivating compassion and inclusivity in your leadership style
- Balancing authority with responsibility
- Building trust and fostering a culture of faith in your team's abilities

# Old testament

Genesis 21:1 - 23:20 (King James Version):

This passage covers several significant events in Abraham's life:

- **Birth of Isaac (21:1-7):** "And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
- **Hagar and Ishmael sent away (21:8-21):** "And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba."
- **Abraham's covenant with Abimelech (21:22-34):** "Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned."
- **The testing of Abraham (22:1-19):** "And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me."
- **Nahor's descendants (22:20-24):** "And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;"
- **Sarah's death and burial (23:1-20):** "And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah. And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her."

These chapters demonstrate God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises, Abraham's faith and obedience, and the establishment of Abraham's lineage.

  

  

Note on Hagar and Ishmael:

- **Hagar's Background:** Hagar was an Egyptian slave of Sarai (later Sarah), Abraham's wife.
- **Birth of Ishmael:** Due to Sarai's infertility, she gave Hagar to Abram (later Abraham) to bear a child. Hagar conceived and gave birth to Ishmael when Abram was 86 years old.
- **Conflict and Exile:** After conceiving, Hagar began to despise Sarai, leading to mistreatment. Hagar fled but was instructed by an angel of the Lord to return.
- **Divine Promise:** The angel told Hagar, "I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count." (Genesis 16:10, KJV)
- **Prophecy about Ishmael:** "And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren." (Genesis 16:12, KJV)
- **Significance:** Ishmael is considered the ancestor of the Arab people in Islamic tradition. The story highlights themes of God's care for the outcast and the complexities of human relationships.

This narrative demonstrates God's sovereignty over human plans and His compassion for those in difficult circumstances, while also setting the stage for future events in biblical history.

  

  

  

Here are 5 examples of how slavery was accepted in the Old Testament:

- **Israelites owning foreign slaves:** "Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves." (Leviticus 25:44)
- **Regulations on beating slaves:** "Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property." (Exodus 21:20-21)
- **Slaves as inherited property:** "You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life." (Leviticus 25:46)
- **Debt slavery:** "If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to you, do not make them work as slaves." (Leviticus 25:39) - This implies that non-Israelites could be made to work as slaves.
- **Female slaves and concubines:** "If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as male servants do." (Exodus 21:7)

These examples demonstrate that slavery was an accepted practice in Old Testament times, though with some regulations. It's important to note that modern interpretations and ethical standards differ significantly from these ancient practices.

# New Testament

Matthew 8:23 - 9:13 (King James Version):

- Key Events:
    - Jesus calms a storm (8:23-27)
    - Jesus heals two demon-possessed men (8:28-34)
    - Jesus heals a paralyzed man (9:1-8)
    - The calling of Matthew (9:9-13)
- Notable Verses:
    
    > "And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm." (Matthew 8:26)
    
    > "But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house." (Matthew 9:6)
    
    > "But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." (Matthew 9:13)
    

These passages demonstrate Jesus' authority over nature, evil spirits, sickness, and sin. They also highlight His mission to call sinners to repentance and His emphasis on faith and mercy.

  

# Proverbs

Here are verses 10-13 from Psalm 7 in the King James Version:

> 10 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
> 
> 11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.
> 
> 12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
> 
> 13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.

These verses emphasize God's role as a righteous judge, protecting the upright while preparing judgment for the wicked who do not repent.
