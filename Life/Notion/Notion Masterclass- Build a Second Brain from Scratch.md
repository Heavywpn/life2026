# Instructions

Based on the transcript provided, I can extract the following instructions for building a PARA system in Notion:

Objectives

- Learn to implement the PARA method for organizing digital life in Notion
- Understand how to create and structure databases for projects, areas, resources, and archives
- Learn to set up task and note management within the PARA framework

Instructions

1. Create a new page in Notion and name it "PARA Dashboard"
2. Create a subpage called "Databases" to store source databases
3. Create the following databases:
    - Tasks
    - Notes
    - Projects
    - Areas/Resources (combined)
4. Set up properties for each database:
    - For Tasks: Status, Due Date, Project (relation)
    - For Notes: URL, Base URL (formula)
    - For Projects: Status, Area (relation)
    - For Areas/Resources: Type (select: Area or Resource)
5. Create views for each database to filter and organize information
6. Set up the PARA Dashboard:
    - Add linked databases for Projects, Areas/Resources, Tasks, and Notes
    - Create an Inbox section for quick capture of tasks and notes
7. Create templates for Projects and Areas/Resources to standardize new entries
8. Set up relations between databases to connect tasks and notes to projects and areas

Note: The transcript doesn't provide detailed steps for every aspect of the setup, so some steps are generalized based on the overall context.
