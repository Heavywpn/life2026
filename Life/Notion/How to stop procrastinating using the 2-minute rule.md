==**We are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why mastering the decisive moments throughout your day is so important. Each day is made up of many moments, but it is really a few habitual choices that determine the path you take.**==

  

==**These little choices stack up, each one setting the trajectory for how you spend the next chunk of time**==

  

==**Habits are the entry point, not the end point**==

### The 2-minute rule

  

==**When you start a new habit, it should take less than 2min to do**==

  

==**The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start**==

  

==**This is a powerful strategy because once you’ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it**==

  

==**A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first 2min should be easy**==

  

==**What you want is a gateway habit that naturally leads you down a more productive path**==

  

==**You can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your desired outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from very easy to very hard**==

  

==**The point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up.**==

  

> ==**A habit must be established before it can be improved**==

  

==**If you can’t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the fine details. Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis.**==

  

> ==**You have to standardize before you can optimize**==

  

==**The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things**==

  

==**If the 2-min rule feels forced, try this: do it for 2 minutes and then stop, your habit can only last 120 seconds**==

  

==**Strategies like this work for another reason too, they reinforce the identity you want to build. You’re taking the smallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be**==

  

==**At some point, once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up each day, you can combine the 2-min rule with a technique we call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal**==

  

==**Start by mastering the first 2 minutes of the smallest version of the behaviour. Then advance to an intermediate step and repeat the process, focusing on just the first 2 minutes and mastering that stage before moving on to the next level.**==

  

==**Eventually, you’ll end up with the habit you had originally hope to build while still keeping your focus where it should be, on the first 2 minutes of the behaviour.**==

  

==**Whenever you are struggling to stick with a habit, you can employ the 2-minute rule. It’s a simple way to make your habits easy.**==
