### 1% Better Every Day

> _==**Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement**==_

  

==**The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them.**==

  

==**But when we repeat 1% errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps. It’s the 1% decline here and there that eventually leads to a problem.**==

  

==**Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1% better or 1% words seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be.**==

  

> _==**Success is the product of daily habits, not once in a lifetime transformations**==_

  

> _==**You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results**==_

  

> _==**Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits**==_

  

==**If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound 10 or 20 years down the line**==

  

> _==**Good habits make time your ally, bad habits make time your enemy**==_

  

### What progress is really like

  

==**Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.**==

  

==**In the early and middle stages or any quest, there is often a valley of disappointment.**==

  

==**In order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau of latent potential**==

### Forget about goals, focus on systems instead

  

> _==**Goals are about the results you want to achieve, systems are about the processes that lead to those results**==_

  

==**The score takes care of itself**==

  

==**If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.**==

  

> ==**Goals are for setting direction, systems are for making progress**==

  

  

### ==Problem #1 : Winners and losers have the same goals==

- ==You can only achieve a different outcome with a system of continuous small improvements==

  

### ==Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change==

- ==**We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem.**==
- ==**What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results.**==
- ==**When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily.**==
- ==**In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level.**==

  

> _==**Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves**==_

  

### ==Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness==

- ==**It’s unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out.**==
- ==**It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success**==
- ==**When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy.**==

  

### ==Problem #4: Goals are not at odds with long-term progress==

- ==**When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it?**==

  

> _==**The purpose of setting goals is to win the game.**==_  
> _**The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.**_

  

  

### A system of Atomic Habits

  

==**The problem is your system.**==

  

==**Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change**==

  

> _==**You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems**==_
