**You're actually saving $445!**

Why?
- Skipping Adelaide saves time/money
- Efficient inland return route
- Still getting Parker's free accommodation
- Better fuel planning

---

## Key Improvements

### ✅ Advantages:
1. **TWO nights at Port Campbell** - See Twelve Apostles properly!
   - Sunrise viewing
   - Sunset viewing
   - Less rushed
   - Better photos

2. **Fixed return date** - No uncertainty, home by Jan 4

3. **Better pacing** - One long day (Dec 23), rest are manageable

4. **Complete plan** - Nothing left to figure out

5. **Lower cost** - $445 savings vs original plan

6. **More efficient** - Inland return is faster

### ⚠️ Trade-offs:
1. **Very long first day** - Dec 23 is 10-12 hours
   - Mitigation: Two drivers, regular breaks, can stop early if tired

2. **Skip Apollo Bay overnight** - Drive through instead
   - Still see it! Just don't stay the night

3. **Skip Port Fairy** - Go to Portland instead
   - Portland has seals, historic port, good facilities

4. **Skip Adelaide** - No time to explore
   - Can visit on future trip!

5. **Long return days** - Jan 2-4 are solid driving
   - But doable, and you've already seen the coast

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why Murray River instead of Coffs Harbour?**
A: Gets you 290 km closer to Melbourne, makes Dec 24 much easier (300 km vs 1,000 km). You wanted a long first day - this delivers it!

**Q: Why 2 nights at Port Campbell?**
A: You wanted to stay near the Twelve Apostles. Two nights means:
- Sunrise viewing (magical, no crowds)
- Full day to explore all formations
- Sunset viewing
- Less rushed
- Better photos
- Worth the extra night!

**Q: Why skip Adelaide?**
A: No time if you need to be back Jan 4. Inland return via Mildura/Dubbo is fastest route home. Adelaide can be a future trip!

**Q: What if campgrounds are full?**
A: Use WikiCamps to find alternatives. Hipcamp for private property. Budget motels as last resort. Detailed backup plans in CAMPING_BOOKINGS_QUICK_GUIDE.md

**Q: Is the first day too long?**
A: 950 km is long but doable with two drivers. Swap every 2 hours, take breaks, start early. If too tired, STOP EARLY - safety first!

**Q: Can I still see Apollo Bay and Port Fairy?**
A: Yes! Apollo Bay = lunch/fuel stop on Dec 27. Port Fairy = optional stop on Dec 29 on way to Portland (30 min detour).
